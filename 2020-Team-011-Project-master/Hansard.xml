<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>: <role refersTo="hansard">Mr. President</role></from>
<p>Mr. President, when this debate was adjourned on Thursday, prior to the Great Escape by Government Senators, including the hon. the Minister of Finance, I had commented on a remark made by the hon. the Minister of Finance that Government spending was well under control.</p>
<p>I hope that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement can be applied to all aspects of Government spending and not only in respect of the increase in the rate of Government spending. It should also include the prevention of the misappropriation of public funds in future on projects similar to the recent Information scandal. Some revelations which have been made recently and for which I believe satisfactory explanations and replies have not been given have made it plain that there were certain expenses in the past which have as yet not been fully explained to the public of South Africa or to this House or the Other Place. Among others, I am referring here to certain expenditure in respect of a weekly magazine called <i>To The Point</i> which was recently revealed. This is something of which we were not aware until it was revealed recently, first of all by Dr. Connie Mulder and then the subsequent acknowledgment of the expenditure of an amount of some R14 million on this project by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is therefore all the more regrettable that when the hon. the Minister and his colleagues were given the opportunity last Thursday to discuss and to clarify this matter, they saw fit to leave this Chamber. There are several conclusions one can draw from this, but I think the most important one is that Government Senators could neither defend nor explain the facts exposed by the latest revelations and that was why they left the Chamber.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. J. GOUWS</person>:</from>
<p>May I put a question to the hon. Senator? Did the hon. Senator not ask me in my office which Orders of the Day would be taken on that day? When I discussed this with him was he not satisfied?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>I was satisfied with the Orders of the Day, Mr. President, but I was not satisfied with the reaction of Senators on the Government side.</p>
<p>†The Order Paper had nothing to do with this at all. It is completely irrelevant. As far as the hon. Senator Gouws is concerned I can only say that he probably made his greatest contribution to the debates of this session by walking out, because if this is the sort of contribution he makes in a debate as Chief Whip of the Government side, he can just as well leave it.</p>
<p>To come back to the walk-out, I want to say to Government Senators that, rather than defend their case, something they owe the voters of South Africa because they have to defend Government actions &#x2026;</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p><i>Ad nauseam</i>? I am sorry if they see it that way, but if that is so then it is not my fault. It is the fault of the Government that this Information scandal is dragging on and on. If it is a case of raising the matter here <i>ad nauseam</i>, then the hon. the Minister must shoulder his part of the responsibility for it. Instead of facing the music, as the saying goes, they chose another old proverb, viz. to show a clean pair of heels. Then, as the saying goes, they chose the lesser of two evils and in this case decided that discretion was the better part of valour.</p>

<p>Which vendetta? This is something about the hon. the Minister which is rather interesting. I have never met anybody in my life who claims to have so many vendettas being carried on against him as this hon. Minister. It is not only the hon. Senator Crook; it is also the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, and now it seems as if Dr. Connie Mulder has a vendetta against the hon. the Minister as well. You know, Sir, in psychological jargon they refer to something called a persecution complex, and I think the hon. the Minister should really take stock of himself and answer this question for himself when he is alone. Does he not suffer from something of that nature?</p>

<p>To the Erasmus Commission? What has he answered to the Erasmus Commission? You know, that hon. Senator sitting at the back there seems to be hard of hearing sometimes. What has he answered to the Erasmus Commission? [Interjections.] But I shall tell the hon. the Minister and the Government Senators on the other side that by running away &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; by running away the Info scandal will not go away. It is going to stick to them like their shadow until such time as they come clean and they give us all the evidence concerned. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I say, Sir, that more and more suspicions are aroused in the minds of more and more people and more and more questions are asked to which fewer and fewer answers are given. I maintain that until such time as everything is properly cleared up, confidence in South Africa&#x2019;s economy and its future will not be properly restored. I make that claim. Walk-outs contribute nothing to restoring that necessary confidence. Open and genuine debating, on the contrary, will do so. I am not alone in this sort of conviction, Mr. President. Had this hon. Senator been able to read, I could have shown him the second leader in <i>Die Beeld</i> on Monday. <i>Die Beeld</i> in its second leader condemned Government Senators for this sort of action. It told them straight that that solved nothing and, if anything, that they had harmed the dignity of this hon. House more than the sort of vendetta they claim is being waged on the part of the hon. Senator Crook. The hon. Senator Gouws should read that leader.</p>
<p>*I want to return now to the speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance. [Interjections.] Yes, I can see the hon. the Minister is relieved, very much relieved; he even has a smile on his face. For the first time in a very long time I see he is smiling again.</p>

<p>You can talk on any subject you choose.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, Sir, I shall talk about anything I choose, and that is why I want to come to the speech of the hon. the Minister now. At this stage, Mr. President, I wish to ask for the privilege of the hour.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance referred indirectly in his speech to certain factors which indicated that confidence in the continued growth of our economy had not been completely restored. That is why I said in my introductory remarks on Thursday that creating a spirit of optimism was not the sole aim of a budget of this kind. But the continuation of that spirit of optimism and the maintenance of its momentum, I think, is the task, more than anything else, of the hon. the Minister of Finance and his department.</p>
<p>I say the hon. the Minister referred to the fact that confidence in our economy had not been completely restored. To which factor did he refer as being the most important? He said that a decline in fixed investment and a decline in the level of supplies had become apparent during the past year. He also referred to the fact that the latest increase in the growth rate had taken place mainly as a result of two factors, the first of which was an increase in the value of exports, and the second an increase in the value of gold production.</p>
<p>He said further that there was an increase in unemployment, which indicated that particularly the secondary sectors of our economy were still not on the road to growth. That is why I think it is necessary for one to look at the incentives which the hon. the Minister announced in his budget as well as in his speech in this hon. House to see whether when considered in the light of less favourable tendencies they will have the desired results, the effects the hon. the Minister is looking for in the promotion of growth. I think one must evaluate these factors.</p>
<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he and I have agreed for many years in regard to one aspect. This is an objective for which I have pleaded during the last two or three budgets, namely that one must try to establish growth in the private sector by the encouragement of increased consumer spending. This is a very important factor, Sir. We agree on this one point. As the hon. the Minister has now made this the main object of his budget. I want to go into it. But before I do so, I just want to say that the hon. the Minister might be too late with this idea. In a previous speech I referred to the fact that the curbing of growth in one&#x2019;s economy is something which later becomes chronic in the economy and feeds upon itself. It becomes a vicious circle in which one factor influences the other. Because of decreased investment there are fewer job opportunities and because of fewer job opportunities there is less money to spend in the form of consumer spending. As a result of the decrease in money for spending one has less investment. That is why I think we should look at the ways and means which the hon. Minister is bringing into play to establish growth. We have had a variety of these methods. In February we had the repayment of a loan levy. Public Service salaries have been increased; in the last budget certain tax concessions were made and then we also found for the first time in a long time that the hon. the Minister had budgeted for a deficit, something else which should have a stimulatory effect.</p>
<p>In regard to increased salaries and tax concessions I want to say that these incentives will make themselves felt over a period of a year. It is not an immediate injection into the economy. It is an injection which is only felt after a period of a year. Even so far as the Minister&#x2019;s deficit budget and through it the creation of more money and more quasi-money, is concerned, this will only become apparent after a year. Because it will only take place after the lapse of one year, the influence on our economy will be less noticeable than the hon. the Minister might think. I think that in the position we are in at the moment, this is insufficient. I think the hon. the Minister could have done more and that consumer spending needs a good deal more than a mere stimulus, especially to utilize what the hon. the Minister referred to in his speech as reserve capacity. By so doing still more job opportunities can be created.</p>
<p>Apart from these factors there are also adverse factors which will have an effect upon these stimuli which the hon. the Minister has proposed in his budget and which, to a great extent, will neutralize them. I want to mention a few and in the first place</p>
<p>I want to refer to our present rate of inflation. I do not see many signs favourable to a decline in our present inflation rate. The hon. the Minister has told us which factors in the year that has passed he regarded as the factors which had contributed the most to the present unsatisfactory inflation rate. Apart from administered prices, we are not sure whether we will have another fuel price increase during the current year. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, when he was in the Senate and we asked him about this, would give us no definite assurance one way or the other.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#senator">
<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard">HON. SENATOR</person>:</from>
<p>He could not.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>I realize he could not, and therefore I am mentioning the fact that even after he had levied this extra 6 cents on fuel, he did not see his way to clear to give an assurance that that would be an adequate buffer against further price increased in the year ahead.</p>
<p>I also want to inform the hon. the Minister that if our growth rate is not large enough, we are also faced with the possibility that in the days ahead there will be further increases in Post Office tariffs and South African Railways tariffs. These are inevitable increases which will have to come if our growth rate at that time is not such that the hon. Ministers and the departments responsible for these two service organizations are satisfied that at the end of the year they will be able to carry out their obligations by way of revenue because of greater growth.</p>
<p>I also want to refer to the recent increases and the increases which we expect in the near future in food prices. Here we have a slight shift because food prices have not played an important part in our inflation rate for a long time. But this year we have to face the possibility that they may well play an important role, and perhaps the most important role, in the lives and the incomes of the less-privileged people such as our pensioners. We also have to face, apart from those prices which have already been raised, increases in the price of milk, dairy products, eggs and a multitude of other agricultural products. While one concedes that the farmer in South Africa has no choice at the moment, faced as he is with high production costs, other than to ask for a higher price for his products, nevertheless I want to point out that this will have an important effect on the cost of living in the near future and the year ahead.</p>
<p>We have had other factors which were not mentioned in the budget. I think for instance of the increase in the price of cement. This is something which will contribute to increased building costs and also to increased rentals for those people who pay rent. I mention this, Sir, because I think all these factors will have an inhibiting influence and effect on consumer spending in South Africa. This is the factor on which the hon. the Minister is relying to stimulate growth, particularly in the secondary sector of the economy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Sir, I want to point out that it is not in my nature to criticize. I want to make certain recommendations to the hon. the Minister to try to rectify matters in this country and to stimulate the economy beyond the present tempo. I think that the hon. the Minister should, in the first place, channel more money than he has appropriated up to the present, to the private sector. He could do this by way of an earlier payment of the longest outstanding loan levy. If that is done, I think he would at once inject a considerable amount of money into the money stream in South Africa, which would give a reasonable stimulus to private spending.</p>
<p>Then I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that whatever proposals might be made in connection with the taxation of capital gains and fringe benefits should be deferred until such time as he is convinced that the economy is on the road to growth.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I think that notwithstanding what the hon. the Minister has already appropriated for the training and education of people, we shall have to spend a great deal more in this regard in the near future. We do have the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission, but I do not want to go into details about those recommendations now. I do want to say, however, that that in itself, even if the recommendations are accepted, will not be an immediate stimulus for our economy unless we are going to devote our energies and resources to providing training as soon as possible for our people.</p>
<p>Sir, we know the history of the past. One of the major bottlenecks we experienced previously when we were on the road to growth was the bottleneck of labour. As soon as our economy started to grow, a greater demand for labour and particularly skilled labour arose. Because there were limitations to that sort of labour and the number of people available to go undergo that training, that became the primary obstacle and bottleneck that we experienced in the growth process. The result was that because of greater competition from the private sector people educated by State organizations like the Railways and the Post Office were absorbed by the private sector and this caused shortages in the service sectors&#x2019; Sir, you know what the result of that was in terms of labour shortages and the provision of services. That is why I ask the hon. the Minister that serious consideration be given to this matter. We have to make the necessary provision for this in future. The hon. the Minister must do this in co-operation with the hon. the Minister of Labour and Labour representative organizations like the trade unions.</p>
<p>In the fourth place I believe that the hon. the Minister of Finance and other hon. Ministers involved in this&#x2014;and in this respect. I think particularly of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs&#x2014;will have to call for more stringent discipline in regard to the increase in tariffs by our State corporations. The latest report of the Board of Trade and Industry, which, <i>inter alia</i>, criticized the tariff increases levied by ESCOM, is one of those indications that something can be done in connection with these State Corporations to prevent the cost of living rising at an even greater rate because of cost increases.</p>
<p>I think this calls for thorough investigation, an investigation which will be worthwhile, because in the past we have learned the lesson that as soon as the prices of steel and power are increased, price increases occur not only throughout the economy but also in the other service organizations like the Railways, the Post Office and so on. For this reason it is important&#x2014;and I cannot emphasize this sufficiently&#x2014;that discipline should be exercised in the ranks of State Corporations.</p>
<p>My last task is to tell the hon. the Minister that I think it is necessary to encourage growth and confidence in the economy of South Africa, and that, of course, is no easy task. But I should not be true to myself if I did not say this to the hon. the Minister. In my view the hon. the Minister should approach the hon. the Prime Minister, be honest with him and tell him that he feels he should vacate his office. [Interjections.] Mr. President, in this House we can accept proposals, discuss proposals and reject proposals, but the little contact I do have with the business world has convinced me that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s image is not what it should be among the businessmen whom I know. [Interjections.] I feel that we shall never be able to develop our economy unless we make a change in this respect as well. And I say this with all the seriousness at my command; I am definitely not being frivolous in this respect.</p>

<p>The hon. Senator asks if I want the job. Mr. President, I must tell the hon. Senator who put that question to me that if one is not even expected to be able to add or subtract, I am also good enough for that job&#x2014;that is, the work of the hon. the Minister of Finance which the hon. Senator has now called a &#x201C;job&#x201D;&#x2014;because in this job one signs for R14,8 million and one pays out more than R7 million without even knowing about it. In this job one cancels one&#x2019;s signature on photostatic copies of a top secret letter of which there were no copies. I cannot understand how anyone can be so naïve and then keep on thinking one is competent enough to hold this post. It is a responsible post, Sir, our future depends on it, and I strongly recommend my suggestion to the hon. the Minister.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#dempsey">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. C. DEMPSEY</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, but for the latter portion of his speech, the hon. Senator Swanepoel who has just resumed his seat, did not make a bad speech at all. I think his comments on the budget were reasonable. It is his job to criticize and we shall always accept and give the necessary attention to reasonable criticism. I repeat, therefore, that I think his comments on the budget have been reasonable. As far as that is concerned, I just want to make three points briefly. Perhaps I did not understand him correctly or perhaps I did not listen properly. I think he could have placed more emphasis on the necessity for increased labour productivity, especially in the position in which we find ourselves today where prices are being subjected to great pressure and where the inflation rate may possibly increase. I think all sectors of industry and commerce&#x2014;and do not let us forget the agricultural sector&#x2014;must once again try to bring costs down and to increase the productivity of its labour force. We can try to combat inflation in that way. That is the one point.</p>
<p>The second point deals with his remark that he thinks stimulation has come too late. Mr. President, it is never too late; in fact, I would not have been happy had the hon. the Minister stimulated the economy to a greater extent than he has in has in his budget. I want to remind you, Sir, that there was no growth in 1977. Last year it was something like 2,5%&#x2014;according to the Reserve Bank, I think&#x2014;and we are planning for a growth rate of 4% this year which is a great improvement compared with previous years. I would rather we had a growth rate of 4% this year and increase it slowly to 5,5% next year than suddenly have a very high growth rate which we will probably be unable to maintain.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I just want to say something in regard to his remarks about the prices of State corporations. Time does not permit me to go into that matter too deeply, Mr. President, but I just want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister and his colleagues, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, to a report of the Economic Research Bureau of Stellenbosch dealing with the building industry. They refer in that report, <i>inter alia</i>, to the role of administered prices, cement and other items and in that connection they say that it is not so much a question of price control but control over profits. There are few competitors or producers in most of those sectors and they do not really complete as far as their prices are concerned. Whenever they realize that a certain position is developing due to a drop in demand or for whatever reason that will have an effect on their profits, they make representations to the hon. the Minister to increase their price so that they can safeguard their profits. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to this because if that is in fact what is happening in that particular sector, I think it is a very unhealthy state of affairs. Most of these items are raw materials, and the increase in the price is ascribed to production costs in the building industry. We ourselves know what an important role that industry plays in our national economy.</p>
<p>†Now, Mr. President, I want to come back to the point which the hon. Senator Swanepoel raised right at the beginning of this speech, viz. the walk-out by hon. Senators on this side of the House, and, in addition, to his concluding remarks when he referred in a rather unfriendly manner, I thought, to the hon. the Minister of Finance. Unfortunately I was not&#x2026;</p>

<p>I do so, Mr. President. Let us look at what has been happening here this session. First of all, during the first week commencing 20 February, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition moved a motion of censure which was debated at length, and the hon. Senators Crook and Webber&#x2014;I shall refer to them several times&#x2014;participated in this debate. Of course, the Information affair was their main topic. Secondly, during the sitting week that began on 6 March the hon. Senator Webber moved a motion asking for the appointment of a Select Committee, which again dealt with the Information Affair. This was hotly debated and again the hon. Senator Crook and the hon. Senator Webber were very much to the fore. During the sitting week that began on 13 March the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill was taken, and apart from the hon. Senator Swanepoel&#x2014;I must give him credit for that&#x2014;the state of our economy and of our finances was of no concern to those hon. Senators. Again it was Information from beginning to end. Fourthly, only a week later, the Third Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill was taken and it was the same story over again, with the hon. Senator Webber and the hon. Senator Crook again debating the Information Affair. And, lastly, during the sitting week that began on 27 March we had the hon. Senator Crook back again at his worst asking for a Select Committee to investigate certain allegations &#x2026;</p>

<p>The question now arises. How much longer can we go on in this fashion? Does the public at large know that certain Senators on the other side of the House have been wasting the time of this House by repeatedly raising the Information affair, covering the same ground over and over again and attacking the hon. the Minister of Finance to the exclusion of all other important issues and matters which could be very fruitfully debated in this House. They did all this, Sir, despite the findings of the Erasmus Commission which had already in its first report completely exonerated the hon. the Minister of Finance of all blame concerning irregularities in the Department of Information.</p>
<p>On 6 March the Senate passed a motion expressing its disapproval of the unfounded allegations made against the credibility and integrity of the hon. the Minister and urgently appealing to Senators Webber and Crook to submit whatever information they might have about these irregularities to the Erasmus Commission. Mr. President, have they done so? Have they been to the commission? Of course, Sir, the answer is &#x201C;no&#x201D;. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Following the walk-out by hon. Senators on this side of the House last Thursday, <i>The Cape Times</i>, quoting the hon. Senator Crook again, said: &#x201C;What he really intended was to reveal information which would have forced the resignation of Senator Horwood,&#x201D; and the hon. Senator Webber sitting there with an eternal grin on his face, not to be outdone, added that he and Senator Crook had sufficient evidence to question certain findings of the Erasmus Commission. Mr. President, I do not believe a word of what they said to <i>The Cape Times</i>, not a single word. It is all balderdash, a figment of their imagination. That is what it is.

<p>Mr. President, the reason why I raise this matter here, is because subsequently a hue and cry went up, especially from the English-language press, which is obviously hand in glove with that party, accusing the Government of playing smear politics. Imagine, that, Sir&#x2014;playing smear politics! I ask the hon. Senators sitting there: What exactly have they been doing these last few months? What have they and their newspapers been doing? They have been waging a smear campaign against senior Government members, among them the hon. the Minister of Finance, and alleging things which cannot be substantiated by even one shred of evidence. And now they are squealing because they are being given a little of their own medicine. That is the whole position.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I just want to raise two further matters briefly. A certain amount of meanness and mischief has crept into, not only the reporting of politics I would say, but even into the reporting of economic events. In saying this I want to draw your attention to the following: About three months before you delivered your budget speech, the financial editor of the local evening newspaper wrote an article which appeared on Saturday, 9 December, under the heading: &#x201C;There is no cash in the kitty for tax cuts.&#x201D; He went on to indicate that the Government could be facing its most serious economic situation since the National Party came into power in 1948. This was three months before you delivered your budget speech. I have here an extract from <i>The Cape Times</i> dated the day after your speech was delivered. What does the heading say? It reads&#x2014;</p>

<p>These are the very words&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Minister of Finance, Senator Owen Horwood, yesterday slashed taxes with a windfall national budget offering more than one billion rands worth of concessions to the public.</block>
<p>And this newspaper which we accept ought to be well informed, had that to say only three months before! I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to this. Is it a question of lack of knowledge? Is it question of bias? What possesses a man who holds a responsible position like financial editor of a newspaper, to write an article of this nature which is completely out of touch with the real facts of the position? [Interjections.]</p>
<p>Secondly, I should like to refer to an article in <i>The Business Times</i> of April, written by a man by the name of Nigel Bruce. It concerns a report of the Board of Trade&#x2014;in which very nasty things were said about the National Party, the Broederbond and all sorts of other organizations being involved in a kind of take-over of Escom, everything based not on facts but simply on what I might again call hearsay information.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, I repeat it is really a sad day for us when we sink to this low level. Today it is a question of a total war being waged against the National Party and against the Government in all possible spheres, not only in the political sphere here in Parliament and outside but even in the economic field, i.e. the way in which we are being sabotaged. What must prospective investors in this country think when they read that our economy is in such a state that it will not be possible for the hon. the Minister to reduce taxation in any single respect? That is totally wrong, totally unenlightened and is a deliberate misrepresentation. There is also an article which deals with Escom which has suddenly become the football of the Broederbond and of the NP. I have nothing more to say in that regard. The chairman of the Board of Trade and Industry viewed this matter in a serious light and he referred those two articles by a certain Nigel Bruce to the Press Council. I think we all look forward with interest to what the Press Council will decide in this connection.</p>
<p>I want to conclude by once again on behalf of this side of the House expressing our appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Finance for the way in which he is handling the financial affairs of this country. Mr. President, he did not inherit a good estate. We know what the position was. [Interjections.] As far as our foreign exchange position and the position of the other sectors of our economy were concerned, things were not healthy at all. The hon. the Minister developed a fixed pattern according to which he would control those finances. Initially he was severely criticized even by the hon. Senator Swanepoel, the main speaker opposite, who thought that the hon. the Minister should have stimulated the economy sooner. He had very good reasons for not doing so. Our balance of payments position is very healthy at the moment and he has made concessions in other respects. From time to time he still does so by way of various announcements which we hope will have an even greater stimulatory effect on our economy than at present.</p>
<p>I have said before, and I repeat, that we on this side of the House believe that the hon. Senator Horwood is one of the most capable Ministers of Finance we have had for a long time. I want to ask the hon. the Minister not to pay any attention to what that side of the House says, and neither should he worry or be distressed about what they say. We will not allow him to resign from his post. He is far too valuable to this country and to this Government. We hope that he will continue to serve the country in that important capacity for many years to come.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Dempsey spoke at great length and delivered so little. I do not propose to deal with the defence of my hon. colleagues. They are quite able to defend themselves. He endorsed the statement made by my colleague, the hon. Senator Swanepoel which was that there was a need for greater labour productivity. I think everybody in this House will agree with that statement. He queried the statement made by the hon. Senator Swanepoel that stimulation had come too late. I should like to ask him whether he is opposed to greater stimulation. Because if he is, then I am afraid that he, as an economist, is seeing the signs the wrong way around. He indicated that the administered prices were not a control of prices but of profits. As far as I am concerned the administered prices have crippled the agricultural community. I shall come to that later during the course of my address.</p>
<p>When he says that we on the Opposition side have been talking about matters of no consequence, I want to ask him whether he does not consider the misappropriation of millions of rand of public money as a matter of great consequence. If he does not, I certainly do!</p>
<p>My colleague, the hon. Senator Swanepoel, dealt with the economic situation at some great length and therefore I shall only deal briefly with this particular subject. During the course of the part appropriation debate I said that confidence was returning in the short-term but that entrepreneurs were awaiting developments in the labour field before deciding on their course in the long-term. Since then the first interim report of the Wiehahn Commission has been tabled and so has the Government&#x2019;s White Paper. The commission&#x2019;s report has been very widely and loudly acclaimed whilst the White Paper has indicated that the Government accepts most of their recommendations. I trust, however, that the hon. the Minister of Labour and his colleagues will not be stampeded by the activities of the extreme right wing into slowing down the pace of development. The problem in South Africa during the recent past has been a crisis of confidence. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Monetary System and Monetary Policy in South Africa, and of those contained in the Wiehahn Commission&#x2019;s report will do much to dispel the doubts and bring about a state that will generate economic development and employment opportunities, which in themselves, will make for a better standard of living for all sections of our community. The eyes of commerce and industry are therefore on the Government to see whether they will remove the shackles that have held back progress for such a long time, and whether this will be done quickly enough to attain a growth rate of 4% per annum. I believe that is the aim of the Government for this particular year. However, whilst that growth rate of 4%, in view of the inflation rate of between 10% and 12% per annum, will reflect a worthwhile turnaround, we must place on record that we need a growth rate of something like 6% per annum to provide job opportunities for all those who come on the labour market each year. That is apart from the backlog of unemployed labour that we have as a result of the very low growth rate over the past two years.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Well, they are always happy because they do not know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>I think we must have a far more dynamic policy&#x2014;a go for growth policy, far more than is contained in the budget before us. I fear that the additional stimulative measures that have been announced will not provide sufficient stimulus to promote consumer recovery. In this respect I wish to refer to the State corporations. In his budget speech, the hon. the Minister stated that the recommendation of the Interdepartmental Committee for the Determination of Capital Investment Priorities that every endeavour should be made to reach a stage by the middle &#x2019;eighties where the share of the public sector in total investment should be limited to approximately 40%, has been accepted. We find this heartening. However, the time has arrived for the Government to take a good look into the expansion of the State corporations. I think it will be found that some of these subsidiaries should be sold to the private sector. The State corporations were founded for a specific purpose. It is my submission that it is not their function to proceed with empire building. I am afraid this is exactly what has happened in the past. Let these State corporations concentrate on the functions for which they were founded and leave the other activities to the private sector. In this way not only will the public sector&#x2019;s investment be reduced but better overall efficiency will be obtained.</p>
<p>Sir, I now wish to deal with the problems facing the agricultural sector. The hon. the Minister of Finance has referred to the economic plight of the farmer which has been aggravated by the serious drought that has persisted over a large part of South Africa. We on this side have so often pointed out the difficulties under which farmers have to labour. Costs of production have escalated alarmingly over the past few years but the return to the farmer has certainly not kept pace by any stretch of the imagination. I have found that many people are criticizing the recent increase in the price of maize and maize products. I want to hasten to record that I am not criticizing the increase at all. To my mind the farmer ie fully entitled to the increase that has been granted to him. That increase may enable him, as a struggling farmer, to carry on instead of being a candidate for the insolvency court the circumstances in which the agricultural sector has found itself over the past few years, farmers have certainly been on the way to the insolvency court.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Sir, the higher maize prices will effect the cost of production because maize products are used very widely as food for human and animal consumption.</p>
<p>Some of the budget proposals will help to lessen the burden on the farming community. These are very welcome indeed. However, I should like to stress&#x2014;I cannot do so too strongly, Sir&#x2014;that the so-called subsidies to the farming community are not in fact subsidies to that community at all. They are in fact subsidies to the consumer. I should like to underline that and to underscore it as heavily as possible. The farmer does not seek subsidies. What he wants is a fair price to cover his production costs as well as a reasonable return for his labour and capital. In the past Government policy has kept down the price of agricultural produce and has placated the farmer by paying some sort of subsidy. I trust that those days are over and that the Government has taken a decision to ensure that the farmer will be paid a reasonable price for his product to enable him to cover his production costs and receive a reasonable return. If it is necessary to subsidize, subsidies can be paid on the product in order to bring down the price for the consumer.</p>
<p>With the greatest respect, I should like to submit that the farmer is the backbone of this country. We have ridden on his back for too long. It is time that the agricultural sector received a decent break. If production is to be maintained&#x2014;let alone increased&#x2014;and production improved to meet the increasing population of this country, either the consumer will have to pay a higher price for the product or the Treasury will have to apply higher subsidies in order to keep down the prices of essential foodstuffs.</p>
<p>The relief that has been announced by the hon. the Minister applies in particular to the wheat and maize farmers. I should, however, like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister the fact that many sections of the sugar belt have gone through one of the worst droughts in history. The crushing season at some of these mills will be severely curtailed with the result that the sugar farmers are going to find themselves in financial difficulties. The fulltime farmer has of course recourse to the Land and Agricultural Bank but the farmer who has other interests&#x2014;be they commercial, industrial or professional&#x2014;does not have that right I am not asking for subsidies for those farmers, Sir. I am only asking that the hon. the Minister make arrangements with commercial banks so that they will be sympathetic towards the problems of these farmers to enable them to keep on running their business.</p>
<p>An appeal was made in the Other Place to the hon. the Minister to re-examine the taxes and other levies that are imposed on the inputs of a farming community with a view to eliminating them so as to reduce the cost of the final product. I think this is a most deserving request We, the official Opposition, will certainly support it without hesitation.</p>
<p>Sir, I come now to something about which I am rather concerned, i.e. the invasion of the powers of the Natal Provincial Council. Last year the Natal Provincial Council passed legislation to amend the Local Government Ordinance. As required by law, this was referred to the State President for his assent. To our amazement, we found that it was subsequently promulgated with certain omissions. Certain provisions had been deleted. According to my construction, this is in direct conflict with the provisions of section 89 of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, No. 32 of 1961. This section provides that&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The State President shall declare within one month &#x2026; that he assents thereto, &#x2026; withholds assent, or that he reserves the &#x2026; ordinance for further consideration.</block>
<p>Nowhere can I find any reference to the effect that the State President can delete portions of an ordinance passed by a provincial council. The State President is, of course, advised by the responsible Minister who is the Minister of the Interior and Immigration in this particular instance. I wonder whether this is another case of a Minister signing a document without reading it; if not, how is this invasion of the rights of a provincial council explained away? To my mind the alteration of an ordinance is as illegal as the channelling of secret funds from the Defence Special Account to the Department of Information.</p>
<p>I want now to deal very briefly with the question of fuel. I am pleased to see that a considerable amount has been provided in the estimates for fuel research. However, I am sure that much more will have to be provided in the future. We fully support the decision to channel money to Sasol II, and we also fully support the extension of that project which, when it is completed, will provide approximately 50% of the fuel needs of this country. Those of us who were privileged to visit Sasol a few months ago were very impressed with the work that is being done and we realized the enormity of this project. But, Sir, the demand for energy is likely to increase, not to decrease, and energy is necessary for the development of our country. I feel therefore that alternative sources of energy must be sought and that fuel saving measures must be encouraged in every sector. To that end I recommend that low cost loans be provided to farmers and others to change over from diesel engines or diesel boilers to electric pumping or solar heating.</p>
<p>A start is to be made this year on the canals from the Pongolapoort dam and we were advised by the hon. the Minister that the crops of sugar cane, cotton and citrus were to be planted on the Makatini Flats. I have suggested to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture that the crop of cassava be considered because this crop will grow in poorer soil, it is resilient to drought and, furthermore, it can be used for the production of fuel. I want to refer the hon. the Minister and his colleagues to the <i>Sugar Journal</i> of February 1979 where we read the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Authors in the Sydney conference indicated that cassava could be processed to yield ethanol at a cost of 6 cents per litre, which is about one-sixth of the cost of ethanol from sugar cane in Queensland.</block>
<p>Cassava can be used for the production of starch as well as ethanol, and extensive experiments have been proposed in Australia. Brazil has already embarked on a scheme for producing ethanol from cassava, and it is planned that ethylalcohol will be manufactured to replace petrol completely and extend diesel supplies by 50%. I commend this to the Cabinet for further consideration.</p>
<p>This article reveals that a plant for the processing of ethanol from cassava can be erected for R14 million, which is, as you will know, Sir, the cost of <i>To the Point</i> to date. It is not a great sum of money. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. President, I now wish to deal with a few matters relating to the Budget in the short time still available to me. Naturally, we will deal more fully with them when the various measures come before us. Right at the outset I want to say that we fully support the improved conditions of service for public servants. But I would like to say, as far as I am concerned, that I would like the Police to receive special consideration because the Police are our first line of defence. They are subjected to danger, hardship and derision daily. Many of them serve in out-of-the-way areas at great inconvenience and sacrifice to themselves. My submission is that they are entitled to special treatment, and I make no apology for asking for further relief for them.</p>
<p>The next item I wish to deal with is the question of pensioners. Whilst I welcome the relief given to pensioners, I reiterate once again my view that these senior citizens should be treated far more generously. It is no use the hon. the Minister coming back to me, as I am sure he is going to, and telling me the same as he told me last year, namely, that pensions have risen far more quickly than the consumer price index has. I say this because, Sir, the consumer price index is not indicative of the spending patterns of the pensioners who by the very nature of their restricted budgets are not able to do their shopping at the most beneficial and favourable sources. I again issue a request, perhaps a challenge, Sir, to the hon. the Minister and also to the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, that they appoint a commission to inquire into the needs and the spending patterns of pensioners because to my knowledge no such commission had been appointed in the past. I feel therefore that it is high time that this oversight was remedied.</p>
<p>The consolidation of the Black states is another matter, and here the hon. the Minister proposes that an amount of R69 million be made available for this purpose. In view of the appointment of the commission to further investigate and review the 1975 consolidation proposals, I wonder whether there is an earnest desire to spend this amount of money. I still await an answer to my query as to why more than R15 million voted in each of the past two financial years, 1977-&#x2019;78 and 1976-&#x2019;77, were unspent. This was about a third of the amount voted in each case. There were no constraints at that time as far as boundaries were concerned. What were the constraints? Why was this money not spent? This, to me, is very odd indeed, and I think that the whole handling of the programme was most inept.</p>
<p>I have dealt with the policy of the past, Sir, and I make no apology for having dealt with it, but I have also dealt with what is to be the policy in the future because that is the great problem&#x2014;the sword that is hanging over both the Black and White people of South Africa. The uncertainty is there and the uncertainty will remain until we are told what will happen in the future. How long must we wait? We are told that it could be anything from two to five years. Two to five years is a very long time in anybody&#x2019;s lifetime.</p>
<p>Many recommendations have been made and also reported in the publication <i>To The Point</i> in regard to the consolidation of kwaZulu. Some have recommended that the whole area north of the Tugela should go to kwaZulu. Others have said that the whole of Natal apart from the Durban-Newcastle corridor should go to kwaZulu. What is the attitude of this Government in regard to this? There has been no guideline whatsoever; all we are told is that there is a commission of inquiry investigating.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, it could be Sea Point too. They should take that hon. Senator and put him in that sea! How long must we wait, Sir? Why have the small towns that have been declared released areas not been bought out? Lack of money cannot be the excuse. That excuse has been completely blown.</p>
<p>While I am dealing with that, perhaps I should deal with the question of estate duty. I have raised this matter with the hon. the Minister before. What is the position of estate duty in respect of people who die and whose properties have been proclaimed as being required for the purposes of consolidation? I want to give an example just to illustrate the point. Take the township of Nongoma that has been declared a released area. This means that no White may purchase land there except under a permit from the Minister. In the case of a death, there is no willing buyer, willing seller. How does an appraiser determine the value of that property? There is only one valid buyer and that is a government agency or perhaps a Black. So far I think only one property in that whole area has been bought out, and then they told us that it was a mistake, that it should never have been bought out. And this is not the only town in South Africa that is affected; there are dozens of them throughout the country. I feel therefore that some guideline has to be given. We have to know what the position is in respect of these towns that have been declared released areas.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the reduction in direct taxation on income is certainly a step in the right direction, and the intention of reducing direct taxes and increasing indirect taxes is also something with which we agree. There has been criticism that the proposals of the hon. the Minister favour mostly those at the top end. I think it is apt to record that the previous maximum figure of R28 000 above which the maximum rates applied, was fixed many years ago. The upper limit is now being increased to R30 000, a mere R2 000 more. But if the inflation rate during the intervening years is taken into consideration one will find that that R28 000 should be something like R58 000, a considerable difference from the R30 000 now proposed. I think it is necessary to place on record here that statistics reveal that if we accept the rand as having been worth 100 cents in the base year 1970, the purchasing power in 1978 was only 45 cents. I think it is apt to record further that the large income earners are generally those executives who carry heavy responsibilities and the entrepreneurs who create job opportunities for many others. The aim most certainly must be to reduce even further the high marginal rates whilst at the same time not unduly burdening the lower income groups.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister referred to the question of the taxation of fringe benefits and I want to say, Sir, that the reason for these fringe benefits having been introduced was in my opinion the heavy marginal rate of tax at the top end of the scale. I think that in many cases it is most unfortunate that fringe benefits were resorted to because, if one works it out, eventually the so-called beneficiary suffers because the fringe benefits do not form part of the pensionable benefits which will accrue to that person.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Sir, I must record further that even the State has resorted to fringe benefits in the non-taxation of the housing subsidies of public servants. Suffice it to say that whatever method is adopted in quantifying fringe benefits some anomalies will arise and, apart from sounding a word of caution as to its application, I shall reserve further comment until the draft Bill or the proposals are available. I do trust, however, that we in this House will have an opportunity of debating the matter before the proposals are implemented.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister also mentioned the possibility of a capital gains tax and said that a draft Bill would be published later in the year. I want to record once again my opinion that South Africa is a developing and not a developed country and that private capital formation must be encouraged at all costs. It must certainly not be hampered. However, I think that further comment would not be apt at this stage save to say that whereas the hon. the Minister has said that that impost will be a very limited and modest amount, it does not often stay that way once a tax has been introduced. It often becomes very widespread and very heavy, and this danger we must oppose and prevent.</p>
<p>I shall deal very briefly with estate duty, having already dealt partly with this matter. We are very conscious of the increased rebates which the hon. the Minister has allowed but these are not commensurate with the benefits which have accrued to the Treasury through the ravages of inflation. I hope, Sir, that as time goes by, the hon. the Minister will be able to increase these rebates even further.</p>
<p>I have dealt previously with the question of life assurance on the life of a deceased person. I want to say once again that the average man in farming or industry has not got the ready cash available to invest R35 000 or R40 000 in Government securities. Therefore, the provision that up to R80 000 is allowed, favours only those who have liquid assets in their estates. I think that this requires further examination because whereas the average person might be able to afford cover on his life for R80 000, particularly if he resorts to what we call term insurance, most of us will certainly not have R40 000 in ready cash to invest in Government securities.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister was informed in the Other Place about the difficulties which have arisen in the case of widows who as beneficiaries receive retirement annuities which carry death cover. The present value is taken as a basis for estate duty purposes but there is no ready cash and this has led to the widow being very severely embarrassed in some cases because the cash has had to be applied to the payment of estate duty instead of her maintenance. I know that the fiscus has to take its share but I would like to ask that another look be taken at this aspect to see if relief cannot be applied in deserving cases.</p>
<p>Another anomaly as I see it is in the case of divorced persons. I fully appreciate the concession made by the hon. the Minister that a divorced person who is maintaining children will now be taxed as a married person. But I think it is most unfair, Sir, and most unreasonable, that a divorced man who is paying a substantial maintenance payment to his ex-wife should be taxed as an unmarried man. I think this is most unjust because his expenses are as high as those of a married man who is maintaining his wife. I would appeal to the hon. the Minister and his department to adopt a far more sympathetic view in these cases because the loss to the Treasury will be minimal.</p>
<p>Time does not permit me to go into greater detail but when the various tax measures come forward we will deal with them at far greater length. I would like to say, Sir, that the budget has some measures which are most welcome and others which we feel do not go far enough. As far as the stimulation of the economy is concerned, it is my submission that we have not gone far enough, and I would like to recommend to the hon. the Minister that the import surcharge be removed as soon as is humanly possible. This will bring down costs and contribute further to consumer-led recovery and to a better economic outlook for the future of this country.</p>

<p>That would be fair and we would then be able to give them more of a hearing.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that the Opposition is no longer seeking information. They are carrying on a vendetta. This vendetta has been in progress for a long time; it has been in progress for years. And do you know, Sir, against whom it is being waged? It is being waged against English-speakers who side with the NP. In 1949, just after the NP had come into power in 1948, the first English-speaker to side with the NP was Mr. George Wynne. They carried on a vendetta against him. They did it in the case of Mr. Trollip and also in the case of Mr. Frankie Waring. Now they are so upset with us because we walked out, but what did they do just over a year ago to an English-speaker in this House? When the hon. Senator Poorter rose to speak, they walked out. [Interjections.] On more than one occasion they have done it to the hon. the Minister of Finance. As I say, Sir, they are no longer seeking information; they are carrying on a vendetta. They have moved right away from the guilty parties, because that no longer suits them, they are out of the picture. Now they are aiming at the English-speakers; they want to get at them. Over the years the UP always acted like a sacred cow to the English-speakers. The UP imagined they were their mother! The NRP say they are the children of the UP, but if that is so they are a lot of weak children. They have rejected the name of their parents. They sit here under another name. They are either adopted children or they are the illegitimate children of the UP!</p>
<p>Victor Hugo, the French writer and author, said on one occasion that if he had to choose between women and wine, he chose wine time and again.

<p>Let us look at the facts. The hon. the Minister was appointed to the Cabinet as a newcomer and an English-speaker. Those are the very things they will not forgive him for. I can tell the hon. the Minister they will never forgive him for that as long as he lives. They have not forgiven the other English-speakers either and they never will. I want to make this statement: The fact is that the evildoers in the Information affair misled the Afrikaans-speakers. Then of course it is obvious that they thought as a newcomer and English-speaker he would be an easy victim to mislead. That is why hon. Senators object to him; that is why they wage a campaign of hate against him. I believe the hon. the Minister of Finance. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I believe him. I am sorry this has happened to him; I am sorry for what he has gone through; I am sorry that this has had to happen to him. The Opposition has shifted the accent from the guilty to the innocent. There sit the new patriots, and what are they doing? Every day they are trying to outdo the Progs.</p>
<p>Mr. President, do you know how the political situation in South Africa has changed? When my benchmate and I entered politics, the struggle was to oust the Government. In those days the Opposition tried to oust the Government, but what is happening today? Every day the Opposition parties are trying to be the official Opposition, in other words, to oust and remove the party which is the official Opposition. I get my information from Swellendam. There it is not really a fight against the Government by way of scandal about the Information affair. They are libelling and defaming one another. [Interjections.]</p>

Touch him, and you touch South Africa. The whole world knows there is no alternative to the NP.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Henderson was very cross with me when I interjected that if you touched the NP you touched South Africa. I now want to call on another authority to confirm my statement. After the dissolution of the UP there was an interview with their former leader, Sir De Villiers Graaff, on the radio and on television. I followed that interview on television. He was asked nicely to say why his party had ceased to exist. He gave his reasons. Not all the reasons are at issue here, but the last reason he gave was this: He said that the National Party was no longer a political party but had become a national movement. Those were his words, Sir, and he used them in 1977 just before a general election. Then we had the general election in 1977 and that national movement became a flood. It swept away the United Party. It shattered it and all that remains is flotsam.</p>

The tendency of a flood is that it continues to rise higher and higher and each time it takes away the flotsam which remained before. This party will yet wash away all of you. [Interjections.] No, I do not want him, but he can go on sleeping peacefully, the brave hero. The UP was a strong party.

<p>They refused to serve on it. [Interjections.] Then your leaders lied because those are the statements I heard them make over the radio. [Interjections.] They were too frightened. They have nothing and they do not want to take anything to the Erasmus Commission. They have nothing. If they had got hold of anything, they would have gone, but they have nothing. They walk about like vultures around a rubbish dump looking for carrion. But they can find no carrion to take to the Erasmus Commission. What I find interesting is that they are no longer vultures, but a lot of fowls. A vulture picks up what is lying on the surface but a fowl scratches. This is the warning I want to give them today. They must be careful not to scratch too deeply. If they scratch too deeply, then they will dig up their own burnt tracks from before 1948.</p>
<p>The Opposition are doing something strange. They give to understand that this is the first time in the history of the world or of South Africa that something like this has happened. There is the human factor. That is unfortunately so. We are sorry about it, but there is the human factor. I do not want to go back into the past. I could go back to their régime.

I do not recall either Minister Waring or Minister Trollip ever complaining about it or organizing a walk-out to avoid facing his accusers.

The Prime Minister of the day, who was held up to us as a national hero for whom we had to vote because he had safeguarded the future of our country, knew of&#x2014;and on a great deal of evidence actually promoted&#x2014;the financing to a major extent of a newspaper and of a journal that sought to support his own party.</p>

<p>I will answer no questions; please sit down.</p>
<p>Dr. Mulder, as Minister of Information, was proved to be a liar in the Other Place. He subsequently resigned as a member of the Cabinet He remained the leader of the NP in the Transvaal but subsequently resigned that post as well. He was then given an ultimatum. If he accepted the fact that he had been a liar for a second time, he would be accepted as a fully qualified member of the NP. That is the morality of the party about which the hon. Senator Van Staden is boasting today! Therefore, Sir, we can pay very little attention to the comments made by the hon. Senator Van Staden or to any of the comments made by Senators on that side who pretend to be so offended by an affront to their high moral standards. When a man can prove himself twice to be a liar, he is fully qualified to be a member of their party! There are also other examples arising from the whole of the Information scandal.</p>
<p>But, Mr. President, we have had to deal with a string of accusations about personal vendettas, <i>ad nauseam</i> attacks and complaints against the hon. the Minister of Finance, the Leader of this House, in regard to this Information affair. The hon. the Minister of Finance has also complained most bitterly. He has promised to subpoena members on this side of the House; he has promised to deal with us.

He has qualities of unflinching courage, whether as an artillery officer facing overwhelming odds, as a prisoner-of-war facing hardships, as an escapee and a partisan or as a politician who over the years has had to face Nationalist Party majorities, inside and outside the House, where he has had to endure taunts, insults and contumely from opponents in many cases with a guilty conscience. He has had the satisfaction of successfully exposing at least one of these scandals on our public life. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, he enjoys our full support for his courage and dedication to duty in respect of this House and as a public representative in South Africa. He is a man who has been elected by the electorate of South Africa to protect their interests.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Senator Crook&#x2019;s example could well be followed by the hon. the Minister of Finance whose duty it is to protect the interests and the finances of the taxpayers of South Africa. He is an hon. Minister who has illegally signed away millions of rands of taxpayers&#x2019; money. He has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that he would not see incriminating evidence just a few millimetres from his signature. My heart bleeds for the hon. gentleman; it really does, Mr. President, when he finds life at the top a little too tough for his kind and gentle heart to endure; a little too tough for his tolerant nature! Really, my heart bleeds for him that he should be subjected to so many unjust attacks, to so many personal vendettas at the hands of that hard, harsh, unkind, unfeeling, and apparently fearsome friend, the hon. Senator Crook! If the hon. the Minister will accept it, I will send him a box of tissues with which he can wipe away the copious tears that he has so fulsomely shed since the days when the brutal students from Natal University bullied him so severely, when he had hoped &#x2026;</p>

The hon. the Minister had expected peace and servile respect in the academic cloisters but instead he had to face up to the brutal students who bullied him so severely, and when he finally got on to the Treasury bench he thought that the craven sycophants on the opposite side, if they said &#x201D;dank die Minister&#x201D;, frequently enough would save him from facing the responsibilities of his high office.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">C. C. HENDERSON</person>:</from>
<p>I believe, Mr. President, that this House should not be regarded as a comfortable club for kindly nonentities to chat amiably about the weather or to deal superficially with non-contentious political issues. Here we have to face the facts, face each other and do our duty to South Africa and to the people who have elected us.</p>
<p>When it comes to protecting the interests of the voters of South Africa there is another issue with which I would like to discuss with the hon. the Minister, one in which I believe he also has a responsibility although this is quite unrelated to the Information affair. This has been touched on by the hon. Senator Swanepoel and also by my colleague, the hon. Senator Bozas. The hon. the Minister has stated that he hopes for a 4% growth rate and has taken measures to stimulate the economy of South Africa to achieve that growth rate, measures which might in the short term be effective. However, only experience will show whether they have been effective or not. He has taken the steps of increasing the money supply and the provision of economic incentives. But I believe that we are entitled to ask the hon. the Minister what the longer term measures are which he has taken, measures which all authorities regard as being essential not only to maintain a 4% growth rate but to stimulate the economy so that the country will maintain a growth rate of 6% or more in order to meet the employment needs of our growing population, to combat socio-economic threats to the security of South Africa and to ensure that at least the economic security of South Africa will be maintained in the future.</p>
<p>I think all are agreed that in a modern economy, not only to sustain that economy but to ensure its growth, a situation in which there is a small group of educated, trained manpower with a large majority group, barely literate, a mass of them untrained or some of them at the best semi-trained, is most unlikely to be able to maintain the economic growth rate which, as I have said, all authorities regard as essential, particularly in a country such as ours.</p>
<p>This is the situation confronting us, a situation of a small group of educated, trained manpower with a mass of uneducated, largely illiterate and predominantly unskilled people. This is the situation we find after 30 years under this Government, the 30 years of which the hon. Senator Van Staden and the hon. Senator Dempsey are so proud. This situation has been highlighted by a report by the Chamber of Mines&#x2014;from which I have taken extracts&#x2014;business journals and the financial pages of the daily and week-end press carrying speeches by leaders of industry and commerce and paragraphs 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 of Chapter V of the Wiehahn Commission report all of which emphasize the need to have a much more highly trained reserve of manpower to maintain economic growth in South Africa.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister himself acknowledged and recognized this situation in his budget speech when he referred to the relatively small group of people who are unemployed among the Whites, Indians and Coloureds. By the same token it was made quite clear that the reserve of trained manpower to create and sustain this economic growth is minimal.</p>
<p>This situation is highlighted in the Chamber of Mines report to which I have referred. The Chamber&#x2019;s human resources laboratory drew up a detailed analysis of the projected increase, so this is not the result of an <i>ad hoc</i> investigation; it is the result of an investigation by one of the most responsible and highly respected bodies in South Africa, one which controls what is probably the most important industry in South Africa, viz. the mining industry. When therefore one finds figures and opinions expressed by a research body appointed by the Chamber of Mines I believe it is incumbent on the hon. the Minister and on all South Africans to pay a great deal of attention to their findings and to their opinions. In an introductory paragraph the report says&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">South Africa is experiencing a serious shortage of skilled White artisans which is destined to worsen over the next few years unless urgent steps are taken to substantially increase the number of apprentices currently being trained so as to meet the economy&#x2019;s anticipated growth in demand for technically skilled labour.</block>
<p>They go on to analyse the effect this will have on the mines, and they forecast in one particular respect&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The need will increase by 31% to 364 000 artisans in 1981.</block>
<p>That is only three years away from today or two years from the end of 1979. The hon. the Minister in his budget speech under the heading &#x201C;Other Appropriations&#x201D;&#x2014;and I think it is important to mention here that he merely grouped the very important issue of education and training under &#x201C;Other Appropriations&#x201D;&#x2014;had this to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Educational facilities and services for all population groups once again received priority.</block>
<p>I believe the very grouping which he made suggests a contradiction to his claim that education and training are receiving priority. But let us have a look at his Estimates of Expenditure from the State Revenue Account and we shall see whether his claim is justified.</p>
<p>The budgetary allocation for the Department of National Education&#x2014;and this is for Whites only&#x2014;has been increased for the ensuing year by approximately R27,75 million. So it does not quite keep pace with the current rate of inflation. It is less than the current rate of inflation of something over 12%. It is the responsibility of the Department of National Education to provide tertiary, technical and artisan training for the country and to develop to its maximum potential the White manpower reserves of South Africa. So far as vocational education is concerned, R9,5 million has been allocated for the ensuing year, which is slightly less than R5 million above the rate of inflation. I wonder whether this in fact is adequate. In passing may I point out to the hon. the Minister that the English translation of &#x201C;beroepsonderwys&#x201D; is &#x201C;vocational training&#x201D; and not &#x201C;vocal training&#x201D;, and I do hope that this carelessness is not an indication of his own carelessness in so far as his responsibilities are concerned.</p>

<p>That is a very objective statement; quite so, Mr. President. At least the hon. the Minister is taking it in a better spirit on this occasion. But whether it is personal or not, Mr. President, it still remains within the sphere of his responsibility as a Minister, but it should not be taken as a personal reflection on him as a man.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that we have virtually reached the ultimate in the potential manpower resources of the White group. We can go on through other allocations but so far as the White group is concerned, we have exploited virtually all the reserves of White trained manpower necessary to support the economy of South Africa. We have to look to the other groups for the potential to support a growth rate which we would all like to see and which should receive the priority the hon. the Minister claims it to have in his budget speech.</p>
<p>As far as Black education is concerned&#x2014; and this is where the greatest potential lies&#x2014; we find &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; that there has been an increase of R38 million in this appropriation for the ensuing year. This is plus-minus 15% over inflation which is a welcome increase. But, Mr. President, when this is related to a population group of over 20 million, it means that for that total population group we have an increase of less than R2 per head per annum. This brings the increase into some sort of perspective. We have an appropriation for vocational training for Black people of less than R1 million for 1979-&#x2019;80, or to be more precise, R998 000. For Black teachers there is an extra R3,1 million above the R3,6 million of last year. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#dippenaar">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. F. DIPPENAAR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I have listened to the sarcastic speech of the hon. Senator Henderson, a speech which emanates from his hatred of and vengeance towards the hon. the Minister of Finance. We are told that we won the 1977 election under false pretences because the irregularities in respect of <i>The Citizen</i> and <i>To The Point</i> were already taking place. I hope that the hon. Senator Henderson will listen to what I am about to say. The hon. the Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, had served this country as Prime Minister for 13 years up to last year. He was tired as a result of the duties he had had to perform. His overseas trips and negotiations with other states had tired him out. [Interjections.] I do not need the sarcasm of the hon. Senator Henderson. That was the position. He was a tired man who had served us day and night. It was not solely due to Mr. Vorster that we won the 1977 election. We won it on the basis of principles, the principles of the NP. The achievements of the NP over the past 30 years instilled so much confidence in the English-speaking voters, the supporters of the NP and the supporters of the NRP and the supporters of the UP, that they voted National with the result that the NP won the election.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the hon. Senator Henderson has been so hateful and sarcastic towards a fellow English-speaking person, why did his party not contest the Assembly by-elections in Nigel, Boksburg and Swellendam on the basis of stating one policy against another? Mr. Vorster had already disappeared from the scene as Prime Minister. Why did they not contest those parliamentary by-elections? What was the reason? They have no reply to that. Once again it was NP policy and not <i>The Citizen</i> or <i>To The Point</i> or Mr. Vorster who was the deciding factor. Hon. Senators of the Opposition were entitled to contest those seats on the basis of policies and principles, but they did not do so. The Opposition do not have a policy that they can offer the electorate but certain things are in their favour. There is the question of <i>The Citizen</i> and <i>To The Point</i>, the Information matter and the drought. All those things are in their favour but let us wait and see what the results will be of the by-elections on Thursday at Beaufort West and Swellendam where the two Opposition parties are opposing the NP. I want to tell the hon. Senator Henderson who spoke in such a sarcastic and sneering manner that that will be the real test We will test the hon. Senator Henderson against the results at Swellendam. I can already tell you what the results will be, Sir. The struggle there between the NRP and the PFP is really comical. Unimportant points are being exploited whilst policy matters are eschewed. Until a short while ago the NRP was still seeking rapprochement with the PFP but at the moment the NRP is as close to the policy and principles of the former UP as they can ever be. However, the electorate of Swellendam and Beaufort West have not forgotten the changes that the policy of the UP has undergone. In 1973 they spoke about White leadership. The electorate have not forgotten that But in 1976, Mr. Kowie Marais, Sir de Villiers Graaff, Mr. Colin Eglin and Mr. Theo Gerdener got together and accepted the 14 principles drawn up by Mr. Kowie Marais. But the electorate of Swellendam and Beaufort West will remember that the NRP and the PFP are so close together that the courtship will continue even after the election so that they can become even closer.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Henderson will know on Thursday that truth has been triumphant. The NP won the election in 1977 on the basis of principles and policy and on Thursday the NP will win the two by-elections on the same basis. The hon. Senator Henderson will have to withdraw his words.</p>
<p>I am an Afrikaans-speaking member of this Parliament I am a member of many other Afrikaner organizations. I was waiting for someone to ask which Afrikaner organizations but nobody has asked me that. I as an</p>

Senator&#x2019;s performance at Swellendam has been so good that we can recommend him. I do not think he will be able to claim membership of the Broederbond after Thursday. Sir, I cannot understand the sharp attack by hon. Senators on that side of the House on the hon. Senator Horwood. I simply cannot understand it because I as an Afrikaans-speaking person have already taken a back seat in constituencies so that English-speaking people could get the benefit. I can prove that, Sir. I have taken a back seat at the highest level. The Opposition parties ask themselves so many &#x201C;why&#x2019;s&#x201D; Sir. The one &#x201C;why&#x201D; they are still asking themselves, is why they got such a shock in 1948. They simply cannot recover from that shock. Even after 30 years they have still not recovered. It was pathetic to witness the division within their ranks. It was so pathetic to see them searching assiduously for the reasons why they were losing one election after the other. But as long as the Opposition advocate a policy of an integrated franchise and a common voters&#x2019; roll they will continue to lose one election after the other, as happened in the case of the UP. However, they have learnt a lesson from the NP, and they are now advocating separate voters&#x2019; rolls. As far as group areas are concerned, they state very clearly that their policy is that people should be free to live where they want to live. In other words, all races can live in certain residential areas. That is also the policy of the PFP. But which schools will the children attend? Will they attend the school nearest to them? Must the children attend the nearest school to which all races will claim admission? The hon. Senator Bozas gesticulates; that is the trouble with that double-barrelled party, Sir. That is another form of integration they are advocating. As long as they advocate a policy of integration as against our policy of separation, they will never make any progress as an Opposition.</p>

<p>That is true, hon. Senator Oelrich. We know that is true. Just think of the large number of industries we have today, Hon. Senators know that we lost millions of rands during the years when the UP was in power. We do not know today what the value was of the goods that were sent to mother England prior to 1948, but it ran into billions of pounds which was the currency at that time, not rands. However, we are not so short-sighted. If the goods were sent to keep them dive and to assist them in building up and re-establishing their industries after the war, we are not so short-sighted as to make the personal attacks on them as they have been making on the hon. Senator Horwood.</p>
<p>During the war years Gen. Smuts promised that the agriculturists, especially the maize producers, would be paid the difference between the price they received and what they should have received. Was that promise ever honoured? Never. It was never honoured. But today the Opposition tries to confuse the electorate in Swellendam and Beaufort West and to get them to exploit the question of agricultural prices whilst it is due to the drought that a large section of the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and other parts of the country are in the parlous state in which they are. If NP propaganda is of such a nature as alleged by the Opposition why don&#x2019;t they make any progress whenever we state our policy, our agricultural policy or whichever policy it may be that underlies our principles?

<p>&#x2026; refrained from formulating a policy in respect of the survival of the two Houses of this Parliament. They did not try to say anything about that. All they did was to raise unimportant matters. They spoke about certain medicines that the aged could no longer obtain, of health services and provincial services that were not available, and so forth. That is downright misleading. However, what they did not tell the electorate of Swellendam and which they will continue not to tell them&#x2014;not as a party but as part of their policy&#x2014;is that should the PFP come into power it will very soon, in terms of its policy, establish a Black majority government in South Africa. As an off-spring of the PFP they are merely moving a little slower. The child must first crawl before it can walk. The NRP and the PFP&#x2014;the names have changed so often in the past&#x2014;should learn one lesson this afternoon, and also in respect of the by-election tomorrow and the other one that we will have at Randfontein and the other by-elections. Since 1948 they have continually leaned towards the liberal left where they are welcomed with open arms. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>Yes, hon. Senator knows about it. The old UP rejected the conservative representatives and electorate on Opposition side on every occasion. When we and the Opposition have to talk positively, they are free to criticize us. However, this NP Government has done a great deal during the 30 years it has been in power. It has done positive things such as improving health services for Whites and non-Whites. It has created work opportunities. Sir, the NP has done a great deal to expand the international sea-routes around the Cape. Nothing is said about the good we did when the Suez Canal was closed in 1967 with the result that ships had to round the Cape. From then on up to 1975 the international world took advantage of South Africa&#x2019;s kindness.</p>
<p>Sir, why does the Opposition not try to build on our achievements as indicated in the information documents of the Department of Information? The actual facts are disclosed there. For example, it states whether a project has been undertaken by the Department of Water Affairs or whatever the department may be.</p>

<p>Everything that happened in the defunct Department of Information perhaps happened at the right time. Perhaps that will inspire the NP not simply to govern this country for a further 30 years but to serve South Africa for an even longer period. *Senator J. L. HORAK: Mr. President, prior to the speech of the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat, I was under the happy illusion that the House was discussing the motion of the hon. the Minister that the House go into Committee on the Estimate of Expenditure for the year 1979-&#x2019;80. Apparently I was wrong. This afternoon the hon. Senator has made of this House a platform at Gansbaai, Malagas or Baardskeerderspos because the hon. Senator has brought the wrong notes with him. He has used the notes in this House that he was probably going to use this evening at Baardskeerdersbos or Gansbaai. Sir, you will, therefore, forgive me if I do not elaborate on the speech of that hon. Senator.</p>
<p>I just want to say that I admire the hon. gentleman as an old-fashioned politician. He is a brilliant exponent of the old &#x201C;boere-verneuk&#x201D;-politics that Tielman Roos used to refer to and which were so popular in South Africa at that time. There is an Institute of Contemporary History at the University of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein. I am very tempted to suggest to the hon. Senator Dippenaar that he presents himself at that Institute as a fine and living example of old-fashioned politics.</p>

<p>I cannot follow the arguments of the hon. Senator. He had a great deal to say, of course, about the expected results at Swellendam and Beaufort West and said that we should wait until Thursday. I think, however, that he was wrong; it will probably only be Friday. He told us that we would realize on Thursday how solidly the people were behind the NP. We shall wait and see what happens.</p>
<p>I do not know whether the hon. Senator knows this but in Natal there is a constituency called South Coast. Until a short while ago that constituency was represented in the Natal Provincial Council by a member of the NP but unfortunately he died. There is a vacancy in that constituency which was previously held by the NP. I can tell the hon. Senator that I am not really a betting man, but if he were to have a chat with me in the Lobby we could discuss the South Coast constituency. We can make forecasts. I predict that that constituency will be taken by the NRP.</p>
<p>[Interjections.] What does that prove, Mr. President? What do the stories about Beaufort West and Swellendam prove? Traditionally they are NP constituencies. But South Coast, however, is a constituency that was won by the NP in the last election and what is going to happen? I predict that that constituency will be taken by the NRP on 4 July.

<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Sir, let me return to the Budget before I get back into the scrum, which I intend to do presently. The Budget has made very considerable tax concessions amounting to something like R617 million. One obviously welcomes these concessions. After all, only two things are certain in this life and they are death and taxes, so it is at least fairly certain that any remission of taxes will be welcomed by the unfortunate people who have to pay. Naturally, we welcome these remissions.</p>
<p>In announcing these remissions, the hon. the Minister said that his Budget contains elements of structural tax reform. That is true, Sir. He specifically mentions the lowering of the income tax scales and the decrease of the rates of diminution of abatements and the increase of those abatements themselves. He mentions those as examples of the concessions which these proposals contain. All that is perfectly true. However, when everything is said and done there is one fundamental element of the direct taxation system, as applied, which remains unchanged in principle. That element is the additional tax burden imposed upon the higher income earners, as compared to that of people in the lower income groups. In other words, the more one earns, the greater percentage of one&#x2019;s income is paid in direct taxation. That is inherent in the system and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s structural reforms have done nothing about that. To put it rather simplistically, the system lays a penalty on success. Surely, it is the successful men and women in this free enterprise society who are the mainsprings of economic growth and development. They are the people who occupy positions in which they are managers, entrepreneurs and skilled professional people. They are the mainsprings of economic development in any free enterprise society. Sir, any damper placed upon the initiative of these people&#x2014;specifically in the form of a tax impost which increases at a higher tempo for every additional R1 000 earned&#x2014;is a disincentive. Thus the economy must suffer in terms of input, productivity, skills and planning.</p>
<p>In terms of these proposals, a married man who earns R500 per month, pays 9,5% of his income in income tax. If by his endeavour, proficiency and excellence, he increases his earnings to R1 000 per month, he does not pay 9,5% any more but 14,2% in income tax. Sir, I regard that as penalizing success. This is inherent in the system and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s structural reforms have not touched that aspect of the matter to any appreciable extent. I want to be fair and say that I accept the fact that the hon. the Minister has reduced the marginal rate of taxation, but the principle has not been affected at all. I would therefore make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to re-examine this whole situation because the present system seems to me to be in conflict with a basic concept of the free enterprise society. I think it provides a disincentive, in fact, to the optimum operation of the free enterprise system.</p>
<p>Of course, Sir, there are other contradictions inherent in our present system that I will refer to briefly. Let us look at the position of the married woman who earns money. The hon. the Minister has again made a concession this year whereby R900 per annum of a married woman&#x2019;s earnings shall be free of tax; in other words, R75 per month&#x2014;a totally insignificant sum. It is an improvement, admittedly, and I suppose we must be grateful for small mercies. But R75 per month as the maximum of a married woman&#x2019;s earnings which will be free of tax is to my mind totally inadequate. A highly qualified professional woman who happens to be a specialized radiologist and is married to an equally successful professional man, said to me the other day: &#x201C;I like to work and there is a tremendous shortage of people in my sphere of work, but I cannot afford it because my income and my husband&#x2019;s income go together, except for R900, for taxation purposes. I must therefore either stop working or I must divorce my husband and live with him in sin. Those are the alternatives I have. We cannot continue to pay tax at this level.&#x201D; I maintain therefore that the R900 is totally inadequate. And yet we are trying to encourage married women who are skilled and trained to continue working because of the manpower position to which my colleague, the hon. Senator Henderson, referred. Surely, Sir, it is not the policy of the Government to dissuade married women to stop working when they can contribute to the economy, or to encourage them to live immorally? Surely that is not the policy of this Government? I do not believe it, even of this Government!</p>

<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>And this is in direct conflict, strangely enough, with the policy that is applied in regard to social pensions. A woman who reaches the age of 65 who is drawing the old-age pension and is working, is encouraged to continue to work, and she is paid the maximum old age pension regardless of what she is earning from her employment. So on the one hand one is encouraging old ladies to continue working because there is a shortage of manpower or womanpower and on the other hand one is saying to the professionally trained younger woman who can earn R10 000, R15 000 or R20 000 a year and contribute to the economy: &#x201C;My girl, if you want to continue working you and your husband must pay.&#x201D; That, Sir is a contradiction in the system and I simply cannot understand it. It would be, I think, a relatively simple thing to tax married women who are in full employment separately from their husbands. Surely the money could be recovered somewhere else. And we would, I think, gain more on the swings than we would lose on the roundabouts by keeping specialized, proficient women in employment. Talking about people living together immorally to avoid paying tax, I will never forget a former Minister of Finance, the late Dr. Dönges, changing the maintenance system which divorced men were subject to in terms of tax. Before 1961, if a man divorced his wife, for good reasons, or she divorced him for good reasons, and he paid maintenance, that maintenance was taxable in the hands of the recipient; in other words, in the hands of the wife. Before 1961, if a husband paid R300 a month maintenance to a divorced wife, that money was taxable in the hands of the wife at a fairly low level. The late Dr. Dönges, whom I knew very well and for whom I had much respect, said quite happily in the Other Place: &#x201C;I want to discourage divorce&#x201D;&#x2014;and he said this very much with his tongue in his cheek, Mr. President&#x2014;&#x201C;so in future the maintenance will be taxable in the hands of the husband and not in the hands of the recipient, of the divorced wife.&#x201D; This meant of course that that maintenance was taxable at a tremendously high rate, probably, 9%, 10% or 11%, whereas in the hands of the recipient it was taxable at a very low rate. That was a very clever manoeuvre but I do not for one moment believe that it had anything to do with discouraging divorce.</p>
<p>There is another point of conflict, Sir. I note with great regret that the hon. the Minister has done nothing in this budget about the excise duty on beer. The young people of today when they play a game of tennis, squash or rugby cannot afford to drink beer. So what do they drink? They drink vodka and add Coke or Pepsi to it, because with the best will in the world one cannot quench one&#x2019;s thirst by drinking wine after a game of rugby. It would practically kill one, I should think. Of course, I have very little experience of these things, very little indeed! So whereas we have it as the declared sociological policy on the part of the Government to change the pattern of drinking so that people will drink less spirits and more natural wines and beer, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s excise policy in respect of beer is in direct conflict with that sociological policy. I will give the hon. the Minister this credit&#x2014; and he gets very little credit these days, deservedly so, I regret to say&#x2014;that he did not institute this system. It was again a previous Minister of Finance who said, I thought very cynically, in the Other Place: &#x201C;Well, I have decided to increase the excise duty on beer because people drink a lot of beer.&#x201D; Well, I suppose people now drink a little less beer, I do not know. But I do know that among the younger people in South Africa today there is a tendency that gives me cause for much concern and that is to drink not beer, after having taken exercise, but hard spirits, usually white spirits, with mixers like Coca-Cola and that sort of thing. I am not talking about my own children, Sir. They are grown-up and are qualified etc. But I see this among the younger people. I say again this is a conflict inherent in the system.</p>
<p>So I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he look at all these things&#x2014; beer, maintenance in divorces, although that is a minor one&#x2014;but particularly at these two things. Firstly, at the earnings of married women because we are depriving ourselves by this system of the services of professionally trained and qualified married women while we have a tremendous shortage of manpower or womanpower; and secondly, Sir, at the basic fact that a man now pays an increasingly high income tax commensurate with what he earns. The more one earns not the more one pays but the more and more one pays! I think the hon. the Minister must try to level that out.</p>

A certain Dr. Engelenburg who was editor of <i>Die Volkstem</i> in those days, went away on a few days leave, but before leaving he wrote some leading articles and left them with his assistant editor. When he came back he was horrified to find that on the day after the Jameson Raid <i>Die Volkstem</i> had carried a leading article on the Panama Canal!</p>

<p>As I say, Mr. President, if I were to sit down now without talking about the Information situation, I would be writing a leading article on the Panama Canal. But, I am sorry to say that this whole business makes me very nearly physically ill. I take no pleasure in talking about it but as a matter of duty I must. I must say that in my view the responsibility lies fairly and squarely upon the shoulders of the NP Government. There is no question about it. I try to be a fair-minded man and that is where I feel the responsibility lies. As I have said before in this House, it goes back to the appointment of Dr. Eschel Rhoodie by the Cabinet over the recommendation of the Public Service Commission. It was an overriding of the Public Service Commission recommendation when Dr. Eschel Rhoodie was appointed over the head of Piet Weidemann. Piet Weidemann happened to be a good friend of mine. He was never anything but a good Nationalist but he was also a good public servant. The Cabinet of the day in its wisdom decided to override the recommendation of the Public Service Commission and Rhoodie was appointed. That was the beginning of a story which has caused South Africa untold harm in terms of our image, our reputation and our integrity in the outside world. It has caused South Africa untold damage in terms of the morale of the people&#x2014;&#x201C;die volks-moreel&#x201D;; and it has been a terrible thing, an absolutely terrible thing.</p>
<p>I am not greatly concerned about the responsibility of individuals. It is not in my nature to look for individuals to blame. I believe in the principle of joint Government responsibility, and I believe that this</p>
<p>Government must take the responsibility for what happened over this whole sorry, sick saga. I want to say this, though the hon. Senator Dippenaar is not here now, that I think he will find in the election results in this country an expression of rejection.</p>

<p>No, I am being careful, and I do not need the hon. Senator Dempsey to tell me when to be careful and when not. I have been here long enough to know when I must be careful. I say that we will find a reflection of that in the election results in this country, including South Coast, which to my mind will be an excellent example of the operation of the democratic process.</p>
<p>You know, Sir, if I were a NP Senator and my Party improved its position at Swellendam or Beaufort West, I would be very worried because I would begin to think that there was something wrong with the national conscience. I would be very worried indeed. However, let us leave that to the hon. gentlemen and let them interpret the results as they come in their own way. I simply want to say, Sir, that after all these months, the Government and the country are still wallowing in this mudpool. As I have said, the sight of this thing makes me physically ill. I also want to say that until this thing is cleared up and cleared up finally and totally, we will walk, all of us in this country, Sir, with the millstone of this thing hanging round our necks. I am a proud South African; I go overseas and I defend my country to the best of my poor ability and I do not like this sort of thing. I think it is terrible and I want to appeal to everybody concerned, for God&#x2019;s sake, let us clear this thing up and let us get to the bottom of it; let us cut out the cancer and let us go forward.

<p>Mr. President, it is a long time since I envied the NRP anything but if there is something I envy them I must say it is the hon. Senator Horak. Perhaps it ill-behoves me as a NP Senator to congratulate him on his speech, but the first part of his speech, particularly in regard to taxation I thought was first-class, and more particularly, in regard to the taxation of married women. Compared with the hon. Senator Henderson he handled the second part of his speech with great delicacy and I think we all admit that he had a point, except for one thing: We are aware of where we went wrong. But I am not a masochist and neither is my party. Beating the breast, wringing the hands and wailing at the wall will not put anything right. We are doing what will put it right.</p>
<p>One would think that the commission had finished its work that everything was over and that judgment had been passed from the way these hon. Senators talk. It has not yet finished its work and judgment has not yet been passed.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Horak mentioned that he had always been very careful. Perhaps that was a mistake. Had he not been so careful perhaps he would have been sitting, like his ertswhile colleague the Minister of Community Development, in the NP Cabinet today. I have a funny feeling that he would be more at home there. [Interjections.] I am sorry to have to kill him with my praise!</p>
<p>On a personal level, Sir, I have always found the hon. Senator Henderson charming but I must say: &#x201C;Beware the Greeks bearing gifts.&#x201D; However, I was fairly shattered today to hear the political and personal venom that fell from his lips. Perhaps the only excuse could be that he is a Senator from Natal. The hon. the Minister of Finance also comes from Natal. He was highly thought of by the people of Natal. He was the rector of Natal University. He was not elected to that position by the NP Government; he was chosen by the people of Natal to be the rector of their university. He also comes from an outstanding family. At one stage his grandfather was secretary to John X. Merriman. I think I am correct in saying that. He is the grandson of Sir Pieter Faure who served in Rhodes&#x2019; Cabinet. In fact, he was just the type for the good old colonial United Party and what a bitter blow when he left them! I think it is laughable to accuse a man who became a member of the NP in the Province of Natal of cowardice. I know Natal, and I can tell you, Sir, &#x2026;</p>

<p>I know it quite well enough. I also know the English from that part of the world quite well enough. I can tell you, Sir, that he showed remarkable courage. Although it was very kind of the hon. Senator Henderson to praise my father and the late Minister Trollip by saying that they would never have run away, more or less implying that they were a finer breed, he should perhaps think back to a remark like: &#x201C;Who would follow a Trollip?&#x201D; and the reply: &#x201C;Only a Horwood&#x201D;!</p>
<p>I can remember the personal suffering to which my own family was subjected. I remember the bitter attacks that were made by certain sections of the UP against my family. My sister was at Redean at the time. I can remember the priest in the Communion class at Redean comparing Judas with those who had betrayed Strauss. I also remember an article in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> which stated: &#x201C;Frank Waring voted with the Government on the Coloured question&#x201D; and, next to that, another article stating: &#x201C;Frank Waring appointed to the Maize Board.&#x201D; I am sure hon. Senators will see the implication that that was his little gift for having voted with the Government. No mention was made of the fact that he had been on the Maize Board for about 15 years. So don&#x2019;t let us be too pious and make out that Minister Horwood is the nigger in the woodpile and that the other men in the past were heroes. Believe me, Sir, members of the Opposition hated them prob ably more than they hate the hon. the Minister of Finance. Fortunately, the dogs bark but the caravan passes. I think they are making a mistake.</p>
<p>I have lots of papers here. You would be surprised to know that the telegrams I have here, come from people of great stature in the business world&#x2014;not supporters of the National Party by any manner of means&#x2014; congratulating the man you are attacking, on his budget and on the personal stand he has taken in this country.

<p>That is right. Anglo American. I will not go into those papers. I do not have time to read everything they say about the Minister, but, amongst other things, they say the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Under Horwood&#x2019;s measures the balance of trade deficit has been turned round. Public sector spending has been kept constant in real terms. Inflation, though still running at dangerously high levels (as it is all over the world), has at least been held in check. The long-standing problem of disincentive effects of high marginal rates of personal tax has been alleviated by the introduction of GST. The presentation and preparation of the budgets have been improved. Substantial short term foreign borrowings have been repaid, and South Africa&#x2019;s international credit rating has improved considerably, giving easier access to world capital markets. This last achievement owes more than a little to Horwood&#x2019;s indefatigable world travels on which he is a tireless ambassador for South Africa.</block>
<p>He is not that cowardly, lying scoundrel that you are trying to make him. I quote further&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">What is incontrovertible is that Horwood is one of the rare men who has placed his stamp on an age. In arguably the most difficult times experienced by the South African economy since immediately after World War I. He has striven to cure past excesses and, though following a deeply held economic conservatism, restore a sound basis for renewed economic growth in the &#x2019;eighties. Some Ministers have nothing more taxing to do than keep the machine they inherit running smoothly. Others have the more difficult task of creating a major new department of state. But most difficult of all is to take an existing policy and to stand it on its head. That is what Horwood had to do. Harnessing the abilities of the civil servants played an indispensible role in the exercise.</block>
<p>May I say something to hon. Senators? Before I had personal knowledge of the hon. Senator Horwood I was told in Paarl that he had the highest I.Q. they have ever had at Paarl Boys&#x2019; High School, and many great men have been to that school. I quote further&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It has been a long road from a schoolboy in Paarl to one of the highest offices of State, from the ex-principal reviled as an ambitious turncoat prepared to betray his English-speaking origins in the chase for office, to the man who brought back soundness and common sense to the management of our national finances. Whether you agree with what he has done or not, there is no denying that his actions since 1975 have been far more crucial to the course of the economy than with either most of his predecessors or even many of his contemporaries abroad. The decisions of 1978 were arguably the most crucial of all.</block>
<p>I want to ask hon. Senators, do they think that these things should be overlooked for wild statements and unproven scandal-mongering? Or are you doing it because you see there a man who has won Natal &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; from you, who has wrested it from your grasp? Here hon. Senators sit, men who have failed to hold their seats, and here he sits, having won the province that at one stage people were talking of giving back. Douglas Mitchell was talking of opting out of Union. I think that is what has made you so bitter. When I say this, I am talking about many of the NRP members on that side. I exclude one or two. [Interjections.] I can only say that last remark is what I expect from that hon. Senator.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Henderson also spoke in scathing terms of the &#x201C;jabroers&#x201D; who supported the Minister. I can tell you, I have been in the National Party for a long time. I joined it before my parents. I want to say that that is one of the things that has held this country and this party together&#x2014;<i>ex unitate vires.</i> We do not do what you have done to your leaders. When my father and his friends attacked Strauss to his face in the caucus they were thrown out of the party. It was not much later that he was stabbed in the back and told that he had to resign because of his ill-health&#x2014;ill-health while he was skiing in Switzerland! We know what they did to Sir De Villiers Graaff and I say &#x201C;we&#x201D; because I still think most of them, had they been younger, would have been in the PFP. We know what they are going to do to Colin Eglin. I say to hon. Senators opposite therefore that this loyalty is not to be sneered at, believe me.</p>
<p>I wanted to speak mainly on something that, in my view, is very important to all of us, men and women here, and that is the position of women in the economy of this country today. I think it is important that we should realize that the women who fight for women&#x2019;s rights are not freakish, they are not doing it for personal glory. Perhaps I should quote the testimony that was given before Lord Ashley&#x2019;s commission of inquiry into the labour conditions in the British coal mines in the 19th century&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Isabella Reed, 12 years old: &#x201C;I carry about 150 lbs. of coal on my back. Often I have to crawl, bent double through water reaching up to the calves of my legs. When I am the first down in the mine, I have to wait for coal and often fall asleep because of the heat and exhaustion. I do not like the work and the other girls do not like it either, but they are forced to like it. When the weather is hot we find it difficult to breathe, and the lights often fail.&#x201D;<br/>Patience Kershaw, 17 years old: &#x201C;My father died a year ago. My mother is still alive and has ten children. I never went to school. I do go to Sunday school but cannot read or write. I go to work at five o&#x2019;clock in the morning and return at five o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. The coal-diggers often walk about naked, wearing their caps only. Sometimes they beat me with their hands when I work too slowly and allow themselves all kinds of freedom. I am the only girl amongst 20 boys and 15 men.&#x201D;<br/>Isabella Wilson, 38 years old: &#x201C;I have had ten children of whom seven are still alive. The youngest was born on Saturday morning and I was working here for 30 years. None of the children can read. The working hours are too irregular. I could read earlier on but I do not find any time now. When I go underground my daughter of ten does the housekeeping and prepares the food.&#x201D;</block>
<p>Mr. President, I am trying to show that women have fought for their rights and the rights of their children because they had to fight for them. In 18th century England there were only two careers open to good women. One was domestic service and the other was governessing. For bad women there was the choice of being an actress or a prostitute. The good women had no choice. If their fathers could no longer afford to keep them, perhaps because of droughts on their farms, they had to send their daughters out to work. If the women were not educated, all that they could do was domestic service, and this was pretty terrible at the time, not always but often.</p>
<p>As recently as 1842 a law was passed forbidding women to go underground. That is not much longer than 100 years ago. In 1847 the ten-hour day was passed for women and children. Few men would work a ten-hour day. Women today were freed in 1867 with the advent of the typewriter. Today we are fighting again, and I want to tell you, Sir, that we have had considerable success. Here I must also say thank you to the Government of the day which I hope will carry on with the work it has been doing in this regard. We have had success both in regard to the divorce laws and, I hope, in regard to marriage laws. Women are being protected and are being recognized not as chattels of their husbands but as people in their own right. But there are still things that we want and things we feel justified in wanting, not because we are being difficult or because we want to leave our homes and our families but because more and more women are going on to the labour market.</p>
<p>Thirty-five per cent of married women work, and I presume 99% of unmarried women. But we find it very difficult to work because, for instance, our income tax is such that it forces us to have to be really dedicated to want to work. And with that 35% of married women who work and who suffer because of income tax, go their husbands. Even if the position in regard to income tax for married women remains unchanged, which seems to be the position at the moment, there are certain benefits we should like to ask for.</p>
<p>A letter has been written to me by the women doctors at the big hospital in the Tygervallei, the Tygerberg Hospital. They tell me that there are certain floors there which cannot run if the women doctors do not work. They explain that they have to pay for their own cars; they get no rebate on their income tax. They also have to pay for their telephones. Their housekeeping has to be done and, because they are working, they have to pay a woman to run their homes. I think we will all agree that if a woman is a doctor and her services are needed so badly that floors cannot run unless she works, it is no good saying that she should go back to looking after her family in which case she would not have these problems.</p>
<p>They have also asked me to speak to members in both Houses about providing crèches for working women. We cannot wish away 35% of our married women. Some of them have to work; some of them we need to work. They ask me to see if we cannot provide well-run Government crèches for which they are quite willing to pay. They also say that schools are used only in the mornings and they want to know why they cannot be used in the afternoons so that the children can stay there, play sport and do their homework. This would leave a considerable number of women free to help with the country&#x2019;s economy.</p>
<p>I should like to read out two things, one of which, a recent statement by Major-General Neil Webster, neatly summarizes the situation that I have discussed&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">People are available and have the brainpower to fill top and middle management positions. Only 15% of our population is suitable for this and more than half of these are women. Now is the time to start training women to fill these positions. If by 1985 we have not done so, we shall be in serious trouble as far as management is concerned. We need to make better use of women, both in civilian and military life.</block>
<p>I also want to quote the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">In a manpower planning study published in 1975, with projections of labour force supply and demand in 1980, a serious shortage of manpower with a high educational level was forecast, this shortage being particularly marked in the case of White women at virtually every educational level. Based on the assumption that 1960-&#x2019;71 trends would continue a shortfall of 59 577 White women was forecast compared with a shortage of 21 127 White men in 1980.</block>
<p>I think therefore that hon. Senators will agree that it is in the interests of all of us that it be made possible for more women to work.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this century women in England agitated for the vote. They threw themselves in front of horses and chained themselves to railings but the men did not give them the vote. But what they did during the 1914-&#x2019;18 war in the factories for the British war effort made the men ashamed that they had kept the vote away from them. They gave them the vote shortly after the war was over. Our South African men have in many ways really been in the forefront of looking after their women. Perhaps they remembered those women of Natal who forced their husbands to trek on into Natal and said they would climb barefoot over the mountains; but they had to go on. South African men have looked after their women. My appeal is this: Please, before it is too late, make it possible for us to work now so that when we are needed we can fill the position quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>I gather that the Women&#x2019;s Legal Status Committee achieved great status among some of the men who sat on the Wiehahn Commission. They said they were astounded at the quality of those women. The representatives of that committee said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">They expressed their firm opposition to the perpetuation of the discriminatory treatment of women in respect of the prescription of minimum rates of pay and certain other conditions of employment by virtue of sections 4(3) and 8(4) of the Wage Act, Act No. 5 of 1957, and of section 24(2) of the Industrial Conciliation Act, Act No. 2 of 1936. They believe that such discrimination is not only objectionable on the grounds of equity but also operates as an inhibiting factor to the fullest possible economic growth and development of our country.</block>
<p>They also ask that&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Government, private enterprise and trade unions are requested by the convention to ensure the elimination of all provisions contained in pensions, medical aid, provident fund benefits and housing loans treating women on a different basis to men.</block>

<p>(Motion)</p>
<speech by="#leader">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">LEADER OF THE HOUSE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the provisions of Standing Order No. 31 (Precedence of private members&#x2019; business) be suspended with effect from Thursday, 10 May, for the remainder of the session.</block>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we on these benches accept that it is totally legitimate, towards the end of every session, for Standing Order No. 31 which deals with precedence for private members&#x2019; business to be suspended because of pressure of Government work on the Order Paper. In fact, in the Other Place, after the 31st sitting day, private members&#x2019; business automatically has no precedence at all in terms of the Standing Rules and Orders of that place. We have no such provision in our Standing Orders and therefore it has become customary towards the end of each session for the Leader of the House to move the suspension of this particular Standing Order. Normally, for the very good reason I have mentioned, we on these benches do not oppose a motion of this sort. But, and this is a very big &#x201C;but&#x201D;, the present state of the Order Paper does not remotely justify the suspension at this stage of private members&#x2019; debating time, which is a mere 2½ hours on every Thursday, and that Sir, with effect from this coming Thursday, 10 May. Let us look at the Order Paper. As it stands it only embodies a few hours&#x2019; work. In the Other Place members and Ministers are busy with Ministers&#x2019; votes which means that very little legislative business will come to us in the course of the next week or so. There is no possibility whatsoever of a landslide of Government business coming to us in this House which would justify the suspension, at this stage, of the Standing Order relating to precedence for private members&#x2019; business.</p>
<p>In the light of all this, I am forced to an irresistible conclusion, namely, that the motion for the suspension of Standing Order No. 31 is plainly and simply a stratagem to avoid debating in this Chamber the motion which stands on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. Senator Crook. In other words, this is not a genuine motion for the suspension of Standing Order No. 31 because of pressure of Government business, which to my mind is the only justification there can be for such a suspension of the Standing Order relating to precedence for private members&#x2019; business. This motion is in fact an <i>ad hoc</i> motion aimed at muzzling the hon. Senator Crook, no more and no less.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#klopper">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. B. KLOPPER</person>:</from>
<p>You don&#x2019;t know what legislation is still to come.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>The hon. Senator Klopper can take part in this debate. We are not muzzling him at this stage.</p>
<p>Of course, Sir, you will not allow me to discuss the merits or otherwise of the hon. Senator Crook&#x2019;s motion. Whatever its merits or demerits may be, that is not the point at issue. What is at issue is that in terms of the rules of this House of which you, Sir, are the eminent and sole custodian, the hon. Senator Crook is absolutely and fully entitled to place a motion of this nature on the Order Paper. It is his right as a Senator and a private member to place a motion of this nature on the Order Paper. I am not referring to the merits or the demerits of such a motion because that is not the point at issue. The point at issue is his right to place this motion on the Order Paper and to have it debated in this House as a matter of precedence in the time allocated by our Standing Orders for private members&#x2019; business. The way to meet such a motion, I would say to my hon. friends on those benches, if those hon. gentlemen disapprove of it, is to debate it and thereafter to defeat it in this House. That is the way to meet a motion of this sort. Walking out and breaking the quorum of the House as was done in my fortunate absence last Thursday, is simply postponing the evil day. One could reach the point of absolute absurdity by walking out every Thursday. That would make an absolute mockery of this place. This stratagem is therefore the inevitable result of that act of folly last Thursday. It is the inevitable result of that action. That is the only logical conclusion one can draw from it. Now we have an <i>ad hoc</i> motion to suspend a Standing Order relating to precedence for private members&#x2019; business. The sorry pass that those hon. Senators have now reached is that they will have to use their majority vote in this House, not to defeat the motion of my hon. colleague, Senator Crook, on its merits or demerits, but to prevent its being debated at all.</p>
<p>I regard this motion, introduced in these circumstances and not because of pressure of Government business, as a grave curtailment of the rights of every Senator in this House, including my hon. friends on those benches. It impinges upon the whole concept of parliamentary democracy as we know it, namely, the right of a man to state his case in this highest assembly in the land. [Interjections.] Sir, you have permitted the motion to be put on the Order Paper. I do not think those hon. gentlemen should question your judgment and your jurisdiction. You have permitted it to be put on the Order Paper, and in the course of debating that motion you, Sir, as the custodian of the rules, would have taken great care to see that there was no repetition and that the statements made did not infringe the rules of this House. That, Sir, with respect, is why you are there as custodian of this House and its rules. The motion is on the Order Paper; it would have been debated; it would have been open for those hon. gentlemen to vote for it or against it.</p>
<p>But, Sir, what they will now vote for or against is the very right of the hon. Senator Crook to debate his motion. That, as I say, Sir, impinges gravely on the whole of the parliamentary system as we know it. I am not primarily concerned with the persons involved in this controversy as I speak now. I am now talking in terms of parliamentary principles. It is a parliamentary principle that speech in Parliament is free and that the opportunities to speak shall only be limited under your jurisdiction, Sir, and yours alone, and by the mutually agreed rules of this House. That is the principle of Parliament. Speech should be free. It should only be limited by the mutually agreed rules of this House and your jurisdiction as the custodian of those rules and not by <i>ad hoc</i> motions to suspend the rights of private members. As I say, I view this with great concern.</p>
<p>After all, Sir, today it may be the hon. Senator Crook&#x2019;s rights which are being impinged upon, and tomorrow it may be some other hon. Senator&#x2019;s. I am reminded of the words of John Dunn, written many centuries ago&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Any man&#x2019;s death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee.</block>
<p>I say that to those hon. Senators who will vote for this motion. [Interjections.] No, Sir, I am not singling out any particular Senator; my caution is in general terms, but it is nevertheless a very grave caution.</p>
<p>Of course, Sir, it may be remotely possible that I am doing the hon. the Minister an injustice. It may be that he has introduced this motion because of anticipated pressure of Government business in the very near future. That may be. It may be that the hon. gentleman has not moved the motion simply to exclude the hon. Senator Crook&#x2014;it may be. Well, in that event, Sir, I am prepared to offer the hon. the Minister a compromise. If the hon. gentleman will as Leader of the House guarantee Government time whenever some Government time is available, as it inevitably will become available, for the debating of this motion, then, Sir, we on these benches will not oppose the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s motion for the suspension of this Standing Order. If I am mistaken and if this motion has actually been moved because of anticipated pressure of Government business, then I am prepared to compromise and say to the hon. the Minister: If you will guarantee that some time before the end of the session, when Government time is available, it will be made available to the hon. Senator Crook to move his motion and debate it, then we will certainly not oppose this motion. I shall await with interest the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply in that respect.</p>
<p>I want to make one final point. The hon. the Minister has been reported in the Press as having said that the hon. Senator Crook should not have sought to raise this matter again by way of a private member&#x2019;s motion but that he should have done so in the course of a normal debate. Now, the hon. the Minister &#x2026;</p>

<p>Very well. It was reported in the Press as a result of a speech in the Other Place. It is the same thing&#x2014;six of one and half a dozen of the other. I simply want to say in that regard that it is perfectly clear to me and it would be perfectly clear to anybody&#x2014;and I am sure it is more than clear to you, Sir&#x2014;that the hon. Senator Crook could not raise this matter again in the course of an ordinary debate because of a previous decision of this House. The only way in which he could raise it would be by way of a substantive motion, which he <i>properly</i> has done. Now, if this motion of the hon. the Minister is accepted, that substantive motion will never see the light of day and the hon. Senator Crook will have been effectively muzzled in this matter. As I say, Sir I await the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply with some interest.</p>
<p>I wish to caution hon. Senators on that side. When they come to vote they must remember that they will not be voting on the merits or demerits of Senator Crook&#x2019;s motion. That is not at issue. They will be voting on his right to debate his motion which is a fundamental right of any public representative in any democracy which is worthy of the name. If we now specifically on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis deprive him of the right to debate his motion tomorrow, we will be infringing a fundamental principle of the democratic system on which our whole past has been, and our whole future will be based.</p>

<p>Very well, Sir, I shall come to that. More than a month ago the Leader of the House, the hon. the Minister of Finance, handed me his full programme. If I am not mistaken&#x2014;and I think my hon. friend will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;he does not doubt my honesty just as I do not doubt his honesty. I think I have proved that to him. The main speaker on financial matters on this side of the House, the hon. Senator Dr. Visser, as well as the main speaker on that side, objected to the date 2 May. They asked me to be good enough to try to arrange with the hon. the Minister of Finance to have the date for the presentation of the budget put forward to 3 May. Because of my impartial affection for both of these hon. gentlemen I approached the hon. the Minister of Finance and arranged accordingly. It was also agreed that the debate would commence next Thursday and would continue until it was concluded. I think my friend, the hon. Senator Horak, will agree with me when I say that apart from the hon. the Prime Minister, there is probably no one in the whole of Parliament who has a programme such as that of the hon. the Minister of Finance. He agreed. The favour he did me, for this side of the House as well as for that side, is now held against him.</p>

<p>I go further. It is an unwritten law that I as Chief Government Whip and the Chief Whip of the Opposition make mutual arrangements as far as private motions are concerned. That is not laid down in the Standing Orders but we always arrange it between ourselves. If that side of the House moves a private motion one week, this side has the opportunity of doing so the following week. Surely that is the position?</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. J. GOUWS</person>:</from>
<p>There is no doubt about that. During the entire year this side has not moved one single motion. But we have had the same motion time and again from that side. And as a lawyer, on each occasion, the hon. Senator merely added a few words such as &#x201C;interim report&#x201D;, for example, in order to come forward with the same old story and to commit the same character assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. President, with your permission I want to raise the following point. The hon. Senator Horak has referred to the fact that we broke the quorum. My wife was in the gallery when we walked out. She told me that the people could not understand it, and the hon. Senator Crook least of all. He then looked for a leader. He did not look at the hon. Senator Oelrich. Neither of course did he look at the hon. Senator Webber, but he asked: &#x201C;Eric, what is going on?&#x201D; My wife and the other people then left the gallery.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#president">

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. J. GOUWS</person>:</from>
<p>Thank you, Mr. President. However, I just want to say that somebody, an English-speaking friend, said to me: &#x201C;This would not have happened had the hon. Senator Horak been in the House.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. J. GOUWS</person>:</from>
<p>Yes. I am quite convinced that it would never have happened. Why not? Let me say very clearly. On Tuesday evening. [Interjections.] No, I am very anxious to have clarity on this matter. I am not making an appeal to the courtesy of the hon. Senator Webber because that would be asking too much of him, but I am making an appeal to the courtesy of the hon. Senator Horak. I want him to listen very carefully. After the appearance of a very objectionable report in the Press and after I had shown the whole programme to the main speaker on the budget on his side, we had a motion on Tuesday. I could not even hear properly what the motion was. I read it the following day. I looked for the hon. Senator Horak. When I go away, I always advise the hon. Senator Horak in writing&#x2014;he can confirm that. I will not be present and that he must please discuss matters with the senior Whip, the hon. Senator De Villiers. I looked for the hon. Senator Horak. I telephoned the hon. Senator Swanepoel on Tuesday evening and told him that I wanted to speak to the hon. Senator Horak in connection with an urgent matter in view of the fact that we did not want to allow the motion. Numerous people know that I said that. You will remember, Mr. President, that I also told you that if possible we did not want to allow it.</p>

<p>Do you know, Sir, that there are five leaders in that party? So far I have not yet spoken to the hon. Senator Winchester. He is the leader of his party. Even then, Sir, I have not gone through the whole list. I still have to speak to the hon. Senator Du Toit because he will definitely hold it against me if I do not do so. He is also the leader of his party, is he not? Mr. President, I want to ask the hon. Senator Du Toit, through you, whether he is the leader of his party.</p>
<p>Sir, I want to make the unqualified statement&#x2014;the Chief Whip of the Opposition has already done so in this House&#x2014;that this is a party that protects minority groups. I am sorry that I have to say this, but unfortunately I have to. The Chief Whip of the Opposition omitted to say something. On his behalf and all the minority groups in this House I want to express appreciation to you, Mr. President, for the jealous manner in which you protect the rights of minority groups and I can bear greater witness to that fact than any other hon. Senator. I want to do this during the discussion of this motion. There is no motive behind any motion that we introduce.

<p>Yes, I am speaking within the confines of the motion, Mr. President; I am still one hundred per cent within the confines of the motion. I do not want to refer to the hon. Senator Crook. I have issued a press statement which I can read to him; in fact, he can read it in every newspaper in the country. We did not quarrel in the least but what we did, was to object to the absolute vendetta that was being waged against the Leader of the House who is the Minister of Finance in South Africa, a person who is being denigrated by somebody who has had doubts cast on his credibility in this House by a Select Committee.</p>

<p>I want to give this advice to the five leaders opposite each of whom has to lead <i>21/5</i> people: If they are concerned about the dignity of this House&#x2014;I say this especially to the hon. Senator Oelrich&#x2014;as they profess they are, they should listen to their Chief Whip. He should always negotiate with me, otherwise the contention of the hon. Senator Oelrich that he seeks to protect the dignity of this House becomes farcical. I advise hon. Senators opposite to recognize the hon. Senator Horak and to see to it that he negotiates with me. He is a wide-awake politician with more experience in politics than all the hon. Senators opposite put together. He knows the Standing Orders and he knows parliamentary procedure.

He was taught a very good lesson recently by the hon. Senator Kobus Jordaan about the stone that never acquired wisdom and the mind that never opened. However there is a third lesson and the hon.

<p>Mr. President, I think the whole essence of the Chief Whip&#x2019;s remarks regarding our opposition to this motion is contained in the closing words of his speech. In fact, he repeated this time and time again during his speech. He kept saying that the Government was busy and that the hon. the Minister was busy, but I want to remind the hon. Chief Whip that this House sits for three days of the week and there is no reason why we cannot sit on the other two days; there is no reason why the session of Parliament cannot be extended by one day or half a day. He says that the Government is busy and that this is the reason why the motion has been moved, a motion which, as the hon. Senator Horak has said, is only occasionally moved in this House. The hon. Chief Whip then proceeded for the rest of his speech to complain about the motions continually being moved against the hon. the Minister of Finance. In fact, he ended his speech on that note. That in truth is what he is objecting to.</p>
<p>This story that the House is busy, that there is plenty of legislation coming forward is so much eyewash, and the hon. Chief Whip knows it [Interjections.] Mr. President, just look at the Order Paper. As I have just said, we can increase the sittings of this House. We are only sitting three days a week now; what difference would another day make if it is necessary? The hon. Chief Whip holds up the book. We are just doing away with a particular motion which appears in that book. When it suits the Government they throw it out the window.</p>

<p>The objection to this motion by the Government side is based on the fact that they object to motions that attack the hon. the Minister of Finance. I shall deal with that particular point a little later this afternoon in my speech. But that is not the way to treat this House. This House has seen evidence of the Government&#x2019;s attitude towards it over the years.

<p>What did you do yesterday?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, what I did yesterday was in defence of the honour of this House, and I shall do it again. I shall do it a thousand times. If the hon. Senators on the other side, and the hon. Chief Whip for whom I have a great deal of respect &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; Yes, I have respect for the hon. Chief Whip, Sir, but if he thinks so little of the honour of this House, then I say that it is better that it goes out of existence now and not at the end of 1980, because it is failing to serve its purpose, it is failing to do its duty in the Parliament of South Africa. Those hon. Senators, looking at me as they are this afternoon, are the guilty ones just as much as the hon. Chief Whip is. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>Mr. President, this House is being destroyed, its prestige established over 60 years is being destroyed by the actions of the Government here this afternoon. To come and say that we are busy, that the hon. the Minister is busy, is so much nonsense and so much eyewash. We can extend Parliament by days; we can extend the sittings of this House to include night sittings as well. I am ashamed of such logic and I am ashamed of hon. Senators on the other side, some of whom, Sir&#x2014;and I stress the &#x201C;some&#x201D;&#x2014;have a degree of intelligence. I am surprised that they could even go along with such a motion. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>The truth of the matter, Sir, is that this Government is now beginning to behave like some of the banana republics in the rest of Africa which they often criticize. [Interjections.] They are beginning to behave like some people in the United Nations. I remember this Government saying time and time again that they are not interested in boycotts; they do not believe in boycotts. This, Sir, is a boycott of free speech in the Parliament of South Africa. That is what is at issue today, not the number of motions moved against the hon. the Minister of Finance, deserved or undeserved. That is not the issue. The issue at stake in this motion is the issue of the dignity of this House. The question of free speech and, in fact, the very question of democracy itself stands on trial here this afternoon. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I say, Sir, that I do not accept one iota of the hon. Chief Whip&#x2019;s claim that this House is busy. If this House is busy, why in heaven&#x2019;s name do some of the hon. Senators on the other side not take part in its debates? They are noted for their silence rather than for their contributions, and when they do get up all they can do is thank the Ministers. They have nothing to contribute to the Parliament of this country.</p>
<p>I have been honoured and pleased to serve in this House, but the longer I serve in it the more I wonder whether it is worthwhile. Let us save the taxpayers&#x2019; money and put it out of existence. Let us put it out of its misery because it is serving no useful purpose when hon. Senators on the other side can prevent free speech in this House merely because they do not like what is being said. They have not got the guts to stand up and answer the allegations made against them. This is the problem in regard to what is happening in South Africa. But, Mr. President, it goes further than that. What is happening here this afternoon can just as easily happen in the Other Place. They are demeaning not only this House but democracy itself, and as I stand here this afternoon, Sir, I must admit that for the first time since I came into this honourable House I feel a little ashamed of what we are doing to the dignity and the history that has been made in this Chamber. I am sorry but unlike the hon. Chief Whip on this side I will not accept even a guarantee from the hon. Chief Whip over there that this motion has been moved because the House is busy and there is a heavy legislative programme ahead of us.</p>

South Africa depends on the proper functioning of its Parliament and it is not functioning properly this afternoon with a motion like this before it. We at least owe it to the people of South Africa to govern properly, not to protect individuals or the NP.

<p>Mr. President, it is indeed a sad day that we should have to debate like this in the Senate. The hon. Chief Whip on the other side professes his highest respect for the hon. Senator Horak, the Chief Whip of the official Opposition in the Senate; he professes his high regard for his integrity and for his ability. But with all that, Sir, he fails to answer the question put to him by my Chief Whip. He fails to respond to the compromise offer that was made by the hon. Senator Horak, a gentleman who, in the words of the hon. Government Chief Whip&#x2014; and I subscribe to those words&#x2014;is a gentleman of the highest integrity in this House who has offered to the Government under these exceptionally difficult circumstances a compromise solution to let them off the hook in respect of the things of which they have been accused by the hon. Senator Winchester, to let them off the hook in respect of all the things that they have been accused of by the Press, both English and Afrikaans language. He fails to appreciate the significance of the compromise offer made by my hon. Chief Whip, Senator Horak. What was that offer, Sir? He put it to the hon. the Leader of the House that if this motion was properly motivated, the motivation being pressure of Government work, we would accept it. We would accept it on condition that the Government gave time for the discussion of this one motion. If debate on this motion were allowed it would only take up 2½ hours of private member&#x2019;s time. The hon. Senator Horak asks for 2½ hours of Government time in an effort to resolve an <i>impasse</i>, a difficult situation which can only derogate from the dignity of this Upper House in our parliamentary system. And the hon. Chief Whip ducks the issue; he fails to respond.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister gave an undertaking in the Other Place that members there would be given an opportunity to debate the report of the Erasmus Commission at length when it was tabled. We on this side have no such undertaking. From the lesson we learnt in the short session at the end of 1978 when we had an opportunity to discuss the first report I want to say that unless we are given firm assurances that we in these benches will be given adequate time, adequate time by our standards, to debate the issue, we are not prepared to listen to any such promises from the hon. Chief Whip on the other side. Because I must remind you, Mr. President, of what happened on that fateful day. We were called to Cape Town for a two-day session and what happened? On the first day the Senate was adjourned by motion of the Government.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>No, I am not objecting to the four hours. [Interjections.] I will tell you in a minute if you will give me a chance. I am objecting to the manner in which the hon. the Leader of the House behaved on that particular day. Knowing that the debate had been limited to four hours, knowing that he had unlimited time to discuss this matter in the Other Place, he came here and spent one hour and ten minutes on introducing the motion! He took up one hour and ten minutes out of the four hours allocated to fifty-odd Senators to introduce the motion and then demanded half an hour for his reply! That is why we want a specific assurance in respect of the time we will be given to debate that report. It is for that reason that we have to use the rules of the House to obtain every possible opportunity to discuss matters of public importance. I do not believe that the Chief Whip on the other side will deny the fact that this is a matter of public importance&#x2014;that the interim report of the Erasmus Commission is a matter of public importance. Where we have the situation, as has been pointed out by the hon. the Chief Whip on this side of the House, where a resolution of this House blocks debate on a particular subject, the only way in which we can debate the matter is by a substantive motion like the one that has been tabled. That is the only way in which we can debate the report in any way.</p>

<p>Precisely, Sir! The hon. the Chief Whip says &#x201C;What about the budget?&#x201D;. The hon. the Chief Whip does not want us to debate the budget but to use that time to debate this other matter with the limitation imposed by the resolution of this House on 6 March. That is precisely what he is trying to do. The hon. the Chief Whip has now admitted the true motive. He is not worried about Government time; he is not worried about the legislative programme. This is precisely what he is doing. [Interjections.] It is no good talking to the hon. Chief Whip. I am now speaking to the hon. the Leader of the House.</p>
<p>I want to say to him that the offer that was made by my colleague, the hon. the Chief Whip on this side, a compromise offer to save the Government&#x2019;s face as well as ours, was made in all sincerity.

<p>Order! The hon. Senator must proceed with stating his case.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I believe that the hon. the Chief Whip has given us no justification whatsoever for what we view as an infringement of the rights of members of all members as has been pointed out by my hon. friend the Chief Whip of our party&#x2014;the rights of hon. Senators opposite as well. I believe that the time has come when hon. Senators on the other side must be reminded of the fact that they are not part of the executive government of the Republic of South Africa. It is also incumbent upon them as Senators to act as a brake upon the executive. As such, the only instrument which they have, apart from any debating rights within this House, is the use of Standing Order No. 31. If any one of them is concerned about anything that is happening in this country, that is the only way in which they can discuss it in this House, unless they can persuade the executive to do so. This being a House of review I believe it is incumbent upon them, in the same way as it is incumbent upon us in the Opposition, to act as a brake upon the executive as well. The action this afternoon on the part of the Government Senators I see as a third occasion on which they have misused the power of their voting numbers. They used it last Thursday afternoon to break the quorum during a debate in this House, a debate of which they wished to have no part whatsoever. So they used this stratagem to deny an hon. Senator the right to debate a motion which I must remind you, Sir, you had accepted. In terms of the Standing Orders with all their limitations you had accepted that motion as being right and proper to be debated in the Senate. They broke the quorum. As I say, they misused the power of their voting numbers. I must point out too that if this is to be accepted as a stratagem of Government then we can completely write off any free speech within this Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. In the Other Place as well the Government has sufficient voting strength to break the quorum on any occasion that they wish because the total Opposition, including the party which I believe will move with the Government on every occasion, numbers only 30 which is the quorum that is required there. So it requires only one hon. member of the total Opposition to be away for them to do that again. I believe therefore that this is a misuse of the voting powers that they have through their numbers in this House.</p>
<p>The second occasion when the Government misused the power of its voting numbers was on 29 March when the hon. Senator Crook, in all sincerity, feeling that his integrity had been impugned by the hon. the Leader of the House &#x2026;</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#leader">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">LEADER OF THE HOUSE</person>:</from>
<p>On a point of Order, Mr. President, is the hon. Senator Webber entitled to say that this side of the House misused its powers in this House when you, Sir, allowed whatever took place on that occasion as a proper part of the debate?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#president">
<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard">PRESIDENT</person>:</from>
<p>I regard the use of the expression &#x201C;misuse of the powers&#x201D; as a debating point. I do not see it as an infringement of our privilege here.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, thank you, Sir. It is in that spirit that I use it&#x2014;that they are using their voting power to achieve something which I feel they should not be trying to achieve.</p>
<p>On that occasion, on 29 March, to which I now come back, we had before the Senate a motion moved by the hon. Senator Crook who in all sincerity felt that his integrity as well as mine had been impugned. He used the only measure which is allowed him, in terms of the rules. The only recourse he had was to request of the Senate a select committee to consider the allegations which had been made against his integrity.</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>I am saying that that was the second occasion on which the Government used its voting powers to deny him a personal right. I want to remind you, Sir, and remind this House, that it is the only right he has. He has no recourse to go to court. He has no recourse to anybody else other than to his peers here on anything that happens in this House. I would remind the hon. the Leader of the House that the words that were complained about were used in this House, so this was the only place where he could do it.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#leader">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">LEADER OF THE HOUSE</person>:</from>
<p>And the commission of inquiry?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#president">
<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard">PRESIDENT</person>:</from>
<p>Order! I have allowed the hon. Senator to make that point but I wish to appeal to him not to elaborate on it. He must return to the motion under discussion.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>I will not go any further on that point, Sir, except to say, just to round it off, that this is the third occasion this afternoon on which we are going to have the hon. Senators of the Government using their voting majority again to deny all hon. Senators their private rights&#x2014;their personal rights and their rights as private members. The whole gravamen of the motion which is before the House now is to deny all hon. Senators&#x2014;I would remind hon. Senators on that side&#x2014;of their rights to introduce matters of public importance into this House in the form of private members&#x2019; motions.</p>
<p>Mr. President, with those words I must support my hon. Chief Whip and say that we deplore this matter. As a last appeal to the hon. the Leader of the House I want to say to him he has been given the opportunity by our Chief Whip to save both his face and ours and I urge him to accept the compromise offer made by the hon. Senator Horak.</p>

<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, without being repetitive, I just want to raise three small matters. Firstly, I want to tell the Chief Government Whip that I do not have the same problems concerning leadership that they have in the NP. I also want to tell him that I appreciate the courtesy he has always extended to me, as I do the courtesy extended to me by the Chief Whip of the Official Opposition. The second point I want to state very clearly and which I want to rectify in view of the fact that the hon. Chief Whip has also referred to it, is the fair and wonderful way in which you, Mr. President, protect us as minority groups. I greatly appreciate that.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>I think the hon. Chief Whip of the Opposition has made a reasonable speech. He expressed certain doubts. He said very clearly that they were only doubts and that he was anxious to get clarity. I am afraid that the Chief Whip on the other side also made a good speech. At the end of his speech, however, he really let the cat out of the bag, namely, that everything centres round the motion of the hon. Senator Crook. As a fatherly figure in this House I want to recommend to the Government to accept the motion of the hon. Chief Whip of the Opposition and that they give an assurance that in due course Government time will be allocated to discuss this matter. Perhaps it will then be possible to end the debate on a happy note.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#leader">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">LEADER OF THE HOUSE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, it was not my intention to take part in this debate and I shall be extremely brief. I rise actually to do three things. Firstly, I want to rebut the hon. Senator Webber&#x2019;s statement that anybody on this side of the House impugned the integrity of the hon. Senator Crook. On the contrary, it is on record that the hon. Senator Crook impugned my honour, which I say was a very reprehensible thing to do. As the hon. Senator Webber has raised it, I still say that there is an absolutely honourable way open to those hon. Senators. They must go to the commission of inquiry sitting across the street and put their case.</p>
<p>The second point I want to make is that I want to rebut the statement made by the hon. Senator Winchester that anybody on this side of the House has demeaned or has tried to demean this House or in any way to affect its dignity. I say that with the full record before us of what has happened in this House. There are too many witnesses, Mr. President, to bear out what I have said for me to have to motivate it further.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Mr. President, the hon. Senator Webber has a very remarkable way of debating. He put a question to me and when I asked: &#x201C;Shall I get up and answer it now?&#x201D; he said: &#x201C;No, there is no answer&#x201D;. I was quite prepared to answer it The hon. Senator must think clearly and not deny facts.</p>

<p>Mr. President, with respect I am not speaking to the hon. Senator Henderson; not at all. I am speaking to this hon. House and to the hon. Senator Webber in particular. The hon. the Prime Minister made it perfectly clear in the Other Place&#x2014;and I believe the whole country is aware of it because it was given great publicity&#x2014;that when the final report of the Erasmus Commission which nobody is prepared to wait for that commission to complete is presented&#x2014;that is what must be done; that commission must be able to complete its report without all this arbitrary interference&#x2014; then Parliament will be given a full opportunity to discuss that report, and that goes for both Houses.</p>

<p>That is what I am repeating here, and if the hon. Senator Webber is not prepared to accept that assurance by the hon. the Prime Minister then he must go his own way. The hon. Senator Horak knows the procedure. It is a matter for negotiation as to how much time anybody gets and there will be a reasonable attitude on our part.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. Leader of the House a question in all seriousness? It is true that we will get an opportunity to discuss and to debate the Erasmus Commission report But still standing upon our minutes will be the decision of this House with regard to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own position. This will mean that any discussion of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own position which anybody wants to embark upon, will in fact be limited by the previous decision of this House. It can only be done by way of a substantive motion such as this. That is how I see it Will the hon. the Minister please explain?</p>

The consequences of that are certainly not in my hands or in the hands of this side of the House. I have given my assurance in terms of what the hon. the Prime Minister said and that is all I can say.</p>

<p>Mr. President, in the few moments at my disposal I would like to draw the attention of this House, as I have been requested to do by the residents of Sea Point, to the fact that they feel they are not getting a fair deal from their representatives. They have asked me to point out that the Leader of the Opposition in the Other Place, who is their MP, Mr. Herbert Hirsch who is their MPC and is also leader of the PFP in that council. Dr. Sonnenberg, a city councillor, and the Cape Town City Council which is controlled by the PFP, are prejudicing them and prejudicing their situation in this country at the moment They consider themselves to be living in a dangerous suburb which was once a prestige suburb of this country. Sir, they ask us please not to take any notice of what their representatives say but to go ahead with the recommendations of the Fouché Commission for cleaning up Sea Point</p>

<p>Oh, I am sorry. It seems to me that the hon. Senator is making very light of what is considered to be a dangerous situation by the people who are living there. I am glad to note that the hon. the Minister of Community Development has said he will implement the recommendations of the Fouché Commission in spite of the stalling attitude of the Cape Town City Council which is controlled by the PFP.</p>

<p>The people of Sea Point must also realize something. They cannot have their cake and eat it They must accept the fact that it is their responsibility to see that their servants are decently housed and to see that there are no people in their servant&#x2019;s quarters illegally. They cannot hide behind this Government while at the same time choosing representatives who do not actually represent them. They must take the responsibility for what is happening there. I offer them my services again and I hope I will be able to do so at the next election. I am sure that this time they will see what we, the NP, can do to help them. However, we are not leaving our responsibility there. Although I was told to get out of Sea Point during the election because it was Colin Eglin&#x2019;s territory, these people are now regretting it They are regretting very deeply what Colin Eglin has done to that territory.</p>
<p>We will do our best to turn Sea Point into part of the rest of South Africa. However, the residents of Sea Point must also co-operate. It is no longer possible for them to take illegal Blacks into their service and then ask the police to carry out raids and then complain when they raid their servants. It is in their interests to see that their representatives take the responsibility for what is going on. I am inundated daily with telephone calls and by letters. If the Sea Point electorate want me to serve them they must vote for me. I am talking now for those 3 000 people who did vote for the NP in the last election, and for those old ladies who were terrorized because they told Neil Ross and his young Progressives that they were voting Nationalist They received up to five or six visits from the PFP representatives in an attempt to dissuade them. I am speaking for those people who cannot speak for themselves and for whom it seems Mr. Eglin and Mr. Hirsch will not speak.</p>
<p>I know and the Government knows that the residents of Sea Point are crying for help. We are also aware of the fact that the PFP is hoping that we will clean up Sea Point while they shut up. We will clean it up because it is our responsibility, but I ask the people of Sea Point to bear in mind that what they choose they will get next time. We cannot go on fighting battles for their elected representatives while they remain silent We ask them to vote for the NP in Sea Point at the next election.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>The hon. Senator Koch delivered a speech yesterday which could not have been more effective. It was an excellent speech, an extremely good speech to be delivered before a meeting of earnest ladies in suburbia. I intend therefore to return to Parliament.</p>
<p>In the first place I wish to give a reply to the hon. the Leader of the House, the hon. the Minister of Finance. He has given us an assurance that after the third report of the Erasmus Commission has been made public, we will have complete freedom to debate the findings and, I presume, debating the evidence which I hope will also be made public. But, Sir, at the same time he has told us that the blocking motion that stands on the Order Paper at present will not be removed. This is the reason why we were forced and had no alternative but to move a substantive motion in this hon. House, which I did. We can debate anything in the final report except anything which relates to the hon. the Minister of Finance and which might have the effect of impugning his honour. That, Sir, is not freedom of speech. If we are to have the same rights in this hon. House as the hon. the Prime Minister has undertaken to give the hon. gentlemen in the Other Place, then that blocking motion must be removed. And if it is not removed, once again we will be gagged; once again hon. Senators in this hon. House, which I have always been led to believe is the Upper House in South Africa, the Senate, once again, as we are today, to an extent, we will be muzzled. Sir, I would like the hon. the Minister when he replies to this debate to take the opportunity of assuring us that the blocking motion will be removed. [Interjections.] You see, Sir, we will not be given another opportunity by virtue of the motion that has been voted on this afternoon, to bring a substantive motion before this House to rescind this blocking motion. This is a most serious situation, Sir, because we have been assured by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;and when I say &#x201C;we&#x201D; I mean that Parliament has been assured&#x2014;that there will be free speech when the third report of the Erasmus Commission is released. I am, however, sad to say that from what we have been told by the hon. the Minister this afternoon, he denies to the extent that this blocking motion stands in the way what the hon. the Prime Minister has said.</p>
<p>Now I direct certain remarks to the hon. the Chief Whip of the NP who I greatly regret to see is not in his place at the moment. But I feel it is incumbent upon me to make these remarks. I have a very soft spot for the hon. the Chief Whip of the NP, and I trust that that is reciprocated. The hon. the Chief Whip&#x2014; and I hope that my message will be conveyed to him by his colleague on the Whip&#x2019;s bench&#x2014;said once again that there was a vendetta being carried on by me against the hon. the Minister of Finance. According to the conventions of this hon. House I want the hon. the Chief Whip to accept what I am saying. I am saying now, Sir, that that is not so, and according to the conventions of this hon. House I expect him to accept my word.</p>

Firstly, I wish that extract of the speech to be recorded in the Hansard of this hon. House. I am also doing it, Sir, because I wish to put a question or two to the hon. the Minister of Finance and I do not wish there to be any doubt as to the subject matter of the questions. I do not wish the hon. the Minister to say at any time that he did not understand the question or questions which I put to him. I do not wish there to be a repetition of what happened quite recently in this hon. House as far as the hon. the Minister was concerned in regard to his not understanding the import of a question. With your leave, Sir, I will quote the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech or that portion of the speech that is apposite for the purpose of this debate.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Under protest and the most earnest pleas of my Cabinet colleague &#x2026;</block>
<p>And I interpolate here, Sir, Dr. Mulder&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; I signed and initialled the document in complete good faith, stressing that I would not look at its contents as I was not at that stage going to be accused of approving any secret project where I had consistently been kept completely in the dark about them. Dr. Mulder assured me that no one would accuse me of any such thing. The Erasmus Commission has explained how, as soon as I was informed by the law advisers that my signature was not required on that document to enable cash to be withdrawn, I immediately cancelled my signature and initials. Now I see that Dr. Mulder says that my initials appear on the document near an item <i>To The Point.</i> What Dr. Mulder is careful not to say is that in initialling and signing that document I took great care to obliterate any items as I turned over the foot of each page precisely so that I should not see anything in the document.</block>
<p>Mr. B. R. Bamford: Were you wearing dark glasses?</p>
<p>The Minister: Except for the couple of inscriptions on the front page which appeared to be in a sort of code I did not see a single item on that document That is very well known to Dr. Mulder. I did exactly the same when a few days later I cancelled my signature as a member of my staff can attest.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that Now, Sir, the question I wish to ask the hon. the Minister is whether he gave the substance of this statement I have quoted to the Erasmus Commission under oath on the last occasion&#x2014;I understand it was the third occasion&#x2014;he appeared before them. Was this the alteration or the amendment he spoke of having made to his evidence? That is the question I would like to ask the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister indicated in this hon. House previously that he was not prepared to give an answer across the floor. Well, I understand that, and so I will proceed on the assumption that it was not, unless he tells me that it in fact was.</p>
<p>I have not quoted to this House from the case of <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Myers</i>, 1948 SALR (1) p. 382. This is a case which was handed down by Mr. Justice Greenberg who is looked upon as one of the pre-eminent judges in South African judicial history. The portion I wish to quote is as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The requirement that the belief should be honest is referred to in Halsbury &#x2026; where it is said that a belief is not honest which &#x201C;though in fact entertained by the representor may have been itself the outcome of a diligence in ignorance&#x2014;that is, of a wilful abstention from all sources of information which might lead to suspicion, and a sedulous avoidance of all possible avenues to the truth, for the express purpose of not having any doubt thrown on what he desires and is determined to, and afterwards does (in a sense) believe&#x201D;.</block>
<p>Now, Sir, at the time the Minister signed the document he deliberately refrained from looking at the details placed before him. I now ask him this question: Why did he do this? Was it because he suspected something was wrong? If in fact he had no suspicion, what is the reasonable explanation the hon. the Minister gives for his actions? But if he had a suspicion and for that reason he refused to look at the details, his conduct falls squarely within the principle of Myers&#x2019; case, the principle I have just enunciated.</p>
<p>The onus is squarely upon the hon. the Minister to explain his conduct in this regard. If he is unable to do so I can fairly and justly assume, Sir, that he had a suspicion that something was wrong. I think that the Minister owes it to this House and indeed to the country to give us the reasonable explanation which is required by law for the quite extraordinary conduct on his part, in both initialling the document and, as he indicated in Another Place, deleting the initials.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, in our law, if the Minister knew of the irregularities, he is culpable, but he is equally culpable if he sedulously avoided all possible avenues to the truth. This is what the Minister of Finance did according to his own speech in the Other Place. As far as I know this statement has not been placed in evidence on oath before the commission. I proceed on that assumption because the hon. the Minister did not see fit to advise me to the contrary when I asked him to do so. Again I ask the hon. the Minister to give us the assurance that he has in fact placed it on record under oath before the commission. Of course, at this stage I could ask him across the floor a second time if this is the position but I accept and defer to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s feelings in this regard. He has indicated already that he is not prepared to do so.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances I am going to warm the heart of the hon. the Minister &#x2026;</p>

<p>The object is to keep you in suspense. I am going to make an approach to the commission of inquiry, the Erasmus Commission, to hand in that portion of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s speech to the commission so that it will form portion of the record of evidence. Once the speech of the hon. the Minister forms portion of the record of evidence, the commission will be in a position to take cognizance of the principle in the Myers&#x2019; case, and I do not need to say to this hon. House what effect this is going to have on the outcome of the commission&#x2019;s decision which we will have in the third report of the commission in due course. I trust that I will not again hear the snide remarks of the hon. the Minister and of hon. Senators on the other side that I do not have the courage to go before the commission. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Do I? I would like to ask that hon. Senator and the hon. the Minister of Finance to do me a favour. I want to ask them to use their good offices to enable me to go before the commission and to give my evidence to it [Interjections.] Hon. Senators laugh. I trust hon. Senators will do precisely that This is the challenge I issue to them and we will see whether they are prepared to do so. I will do whatever I can to give my evidence before the commission. I will do everything in my power. I would remind the hon. the Minister that on several occasions he has threatened to have me sub poenaed to appear before the commission. Whether or not he carried out that threat I do not know but what he can do now, is to use his good offices as a Minister of State in order to make sure that I appear before the commission. I wish for nothing more than to do so.</p>
<p>One of the disquieting aspects of the second interim report of the commission is that this report inculpates Mr. Vorster whereas the first interim report exculpated him on the same evidence, that is to say, on the evidence taken before the first interim report was published. Furthermore, unhappily, the second report gives the unfortunate impression that Mr. Vorster is inculpated in order to exculpate the hon. the Minister of Finance. In the second report the commission indicates that it had to satisfy itself that&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">He (Senator Horwood) was in fact every time &#x2026;</block>
<p>I repeat&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; was in fact every time, on application for a certain amount confronted with a <i>fair accompli</i> by Information in the allocation of funds.</block>
<p>Relying on the evidence of Rhoodie the commission proceeds&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Secretary (Dr. Rhoodie) decided in consultation with his Minister that the estimated funds for the coming year would be and thus discussed this with the Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster. Only after the Prime Minister had put his stamp of approval on the amount, was Senator Horwood simply informed that the amount had been determined in consultation with the Prime Minister and Senator Horwood had no other choice than to include the amount in his estimates with sometimes a minimal curtailment Thus according to Dr. Rhoodie, after the amount of funds applied for had been decided by the hierarchy of Secretary (Dr. Rhoodie), Minister (Dr. Mulder) and the Prime Minister (Mr. Vorster), the nature of projects for which they were requested, was kept secret within this restricted circle.</block>
<p>Several important points arise out of these observations by the commission.</p>
<p>Firstly, this evidence of Dr. Rhoodie has apparently been adopted as a finding of the commission, although <i>ex facie</i> the commission&#x2019;s reports, it has not been corroborated by any other witness.</p>
<p>Secondly, this evidence was given before the first report Thirdly, the commission in the first report rejected Rhoodie&#x2019;s evidence where it conflicted with Mr. Vorster&#x2019;s evidence which it found was the truth. Mr. Vorster&#x2019;s evidence was that he was unaware of the financing of <i>The Citizen</i> or of the commission of serious irregularities by the Department of Information before the latter half of 1977. That was his evidence. Rhoodie&#x2019;s credibility was impugned for a number of reasons, as you will recollect, Sir, having read the report He was found guilty, <i>inter alia</i>, of a gross neglect of duty, misleading the Department of Defence, gross negligence, being guilty of the contravention of section 124(b) of Act 8 of 1962, attempting to conceal irregularities pointing to fraud and theft, theft and complicity in theft and fraud, and general lack of veracity. That was the credibility of Dr. Rhoodie.</p>
<p>Fourthly, by implication the commission now finds that from 1975 Mr. Vorster, Dr. Mulder and Dr. Rhoodie decided on the amount of funds to be allocated to the secret projects each year. I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The nature of the projects for which they were requested was kept secret within this restricted circle.</block>
<p>That is what the commission finds now. Surely this means that Mr. Vorster was aware of and financed <i>The Citizen</i> from its inception which was in 1976.</p>
<p>Fifthly, the Minister&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014;became a rubber stamp.</p>
<p>Sixthly, Mr. Vorster is fully associated with the culpability of both Dr. Mulder and Dr. Rhoodie.</p>
<p>Seventhly, notwithstanding the evidence given under oath by both Dr. Mulder and Dr. Rhoodie that the hon. the Minister of Finance was aware of the State&#x2019;s financing of <i>The Citizen</i> before April 1978, the commission views Rhoodie&#x2019;s evidence as corroboration of the Minister&#x2019;s emphatic denial that he was aware of the financing of <i>The Citizen</i> and finds accordingly.</p>
<p>In doing this the commission has executed an astounding <i>volte face</i> in its finding on Mr. Vorster. In the first report he was exculpated whilst in the second, relying on Rhoodie&#x2019;s evidence, he is inculpated. It is clear that it is only on the basis of Rhoodie&#x2019;s evidence that the hon. the Minister of Finance could be exculpated as the commission observed, and I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The question may in the opinion of the commission rightly be asked how it is possible that Senator Horwood could allocate a fixed amount for secret operations without ascertaining the nature and the use of each project for which the money was requested.</block>
<p>Rhoodie&#x2019;s evidence provided the formula. According to his evidence the Minister of Finance merely acted as a rubber stamp, as Mr. Vorster, Dr. Mulder and Rhoodie decided on the amount of funds to be allocated to the secret projects each year. In terms of this evidence the Minister of Finance was exculpated but of necessity Mr. Vorster was inculpated.</p>
<p>There are a number of anomalies in the commission&#x2019;s latest finding other than those referred to already. The most damaging of these is the evidence of the hon. the Minister himself, evidence given on oath. So far was the hon. the Minister from rubber-stamping the amounts that were submitted to him with &#x201C;sometimes a minimal curtailment&#x201D;, to use the words of the commission, that the hon. the Minister says on oath, and I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Sometimes they came they wanted R20 million which I cut down. Once they came they wanted R23,9 million. I cut it down severely.</block>
<p>Moreover, in a speech in this hon. House he was even more explicit when he said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Then, of course, Mr. President, I repeatedly cut back on the amounts which he asked for year by year, so much so that on one particular occasion he asked for R23,9 million, and if my memory serves me correctly, I cut him back to something like R14 of R15 million. He has not forgotten that.</block>
<p>Hon. Senators will find that in the Senate Hansard of Thursday, 22 March 1979, col. 1012.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rubber stamp finding with its restricted circle of Mr. Vorster, Dr. Mulder and Rhoodie is inconsistent with paragraph 11.356 of the first report, which paragraph carries the commission&#x2019;s approval.</p>

<p>He is my echo, Sir. Little Sir Echo!&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On January 21, 1977 Treasury wrote to Dr. Rhoodie that after consultation between Mr. Vorster and Senator Horwood, a further R2 million was allocated to the secret fund in the Budget.</block>
<p>This letter was written in response to the Department of Information&#x2019;s fear that no funds would be made available for the secret fund for the 1977-&#x2019;78 financial year owing to the final refusal of the hon. the Minister of Defence, the present Prime Minister, to make funds available to the department through the Special Defence Account.</p>
<p>Paragraph 11.357 is also inconsistent with the rubber stamp story. I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It appears from a letter from Dr. Rhoodie dated 24 January 1977 to the Secretary of the Treasury, that Dr. Mulder had given him (Rhoodie) to understand that provision of a further R3 million in the revised Estimates could be applied for. Treasury wrote to Dr. Rhoodie on 2 February 1977 that the Minister of Finance had given no such undertaking to Dr. Mulder and refused to provide the R3 million. It was clearly as a result of this refusal by the Minister of Finance through Treasury to provide the further R3 million that the department decided on its own to negotiate foreign loans for itself on its own.</block>
<p>These extracts from the first report, the Minister&#x2019;s own evidence and the sheer improbabilities make nonsense of the rubber stamp story. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. President, may I say that we have had an exhibition here this afternoon, which has not really surprised us, from a very well-known hon. Senator on the other side who has just resumed his seat. We expect nothing from him but this sort of tirade which he always indulges in. Very few constructive suggestions have ever come from him. [Interjections.] I shall appreciate it if the hon. Senator would do me the courtesy of listening to me. I listened carefully to what he said and I shall try to the best of my ability to answer certain statements he made here this afternoon.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator strenuously denied that he and others were conducting a witchhunt against the hon. Senator Horwood. But what did he prove to us this afternoon, other than that he and the Press which supports him are continuing with that witchhunt? In my view, a few interesting things have happened. The hon. Senator went out of his way to bring the hon. the Minister of Finance into discredit, but who did he call as witnesses? He called as a witness a person, Dr. Mulder, who yesterday was labelled by his colleague, the hon. Senator Henderson, as a liar. I did not say it; his colleague labelled Dr. Mulder as a liar and said this was the sort of person the NP wanted to readmit to its ranks if only he would accept the report of the Erasmus Commission.

<p>Mr. President, with your permission I should like to pause here this afternoon for a few moments to ask: Who is this person, Owen Horwood, whom the Opposition want to destroy and bring into discredit by questioning his credibility? That is what they are after. They are conducting a witchhunt against this man. Who is he, and what is the reason they are doing it? For what reason are they doing it? They obviously must have a good reason if they keep on with a campaign against this man. He is the man, Mr. President, who in the years when he was rector of Natal University took action against the leftist elements in that university. That is where he became the object of the mistrust and the hatred of the leftist elements. This man, Owen Horwood, is the man who, since he became leader of the NP in Natal, has lead Natal to victory, so that today we have the most parliamentary seats in Natal of any party, something which was unthinkable a few years ago. This man, Owen Horwood, as leader of the NP in Natal, has unified the party as never before. We are one strong group of people with only one objective under his guidance. I want to say to the House, and I want to tell the hon. Senator Crook, that he enjoys the loyalty and the support of every member of the NP in Natal, and we want to stand by him. We have confidence in him as leader and we have confidence in him as Minister of Finance. In fact, we have a great deal of confidence in him in all respects.</p>
<p>I want to go further. I would really appreciate it if that hon. friend would not sit and mumble so. I am making a speech.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#president">
<from>*<person refersTo="hansard">Mr. PRESIDENT</person>:</from>
<p>The hon. Senator must continue with his speech.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#klopper">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. B. KLOPPER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I shall try to do so. That is the person the hon. Senator Crook wants to discredit here. But it is purely in a party-political connection. Let us look at what this man, Owen Horwood, has already achieved as Minister of Finance. I want to remind hon. Senators that when he became Minister of Finance of South Africa, it was under difficult circumstances. It was not the easiest situation in the history of South Africa which then prevailed. He succeeded in bringing State spending under control and keeping it under control as a result of his financial disciplines. He did this in spite of the fact that South Africa&#x2019;s requirements in the sphere of defence were increasing. This man succeeded as Minister of Finance in keeping inflation in check. He prevented a galloping inflation in South Africa which happened in so many other countries, and under very difficult circumstances at that Mr. President, I also want to remind you that the hon. Senator Horwood is the man who succeeded in reversing a very delicate position in South Africa, namely, the state of the current account of the balance of payments. It has been reversed and that strong balance of payments, which was the result of the implementation of his policy, has contributed to the creation of confidence abroad in South Africa&#x2019;s position.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Horwood succeeded in making tax concessions. He is the person who appointed the De Kock Commission which is probably one of the most important commissions ever appointed in South Africa. What will that inquiry and those recommendations not mean to South Africa? Mr. President, it is because the hon. Senator Horwood is an English-speaking leader of the NP in Natal&#x2014;not appointed but elected&#x2014;and because he is bringing the English and Afrikaans speakers in Natal and also in South Africa together as never before in our history, that the hon. Senator Crook and those of his ilk&#x2014;but not everybody in that party&#x2014;are conducting this witchhunt against him, not only in this House but outside as well. Who are these people who are in such an indecent hurry to discredit a respected person and a beloved leader of the NP in Natal?</p>
<p>We heard how the hon. Senator Crook carried on this afternoon. He is very disturbed about the resolution which will block discussions concerning the hon. Senator Horwood in this House. Do you know, Mr. President, I was under the impression this afternoon that the hon. Senator Crook was bitterly disappointed by the impulsive action of his leader in Natal in moving his motion so soon. Did they not consider the consequences? Did they not consider it possible that this House would find him completely innocent in this connection and give him a clean bill of health? Did they not think that the result might be that a similar motion would not be permitted to be discussed at a later stage? It is because of their own ill-judged and impulsive actions that they find themselves in this situation.</p>
<p>Mr. President, let us take this further. We heard how the hon. Senator Crook in very angry terms and in a very emotion-laden speech, attacked the hon. Senator Horwood this afternoon. When another motion was moved in the House, a certain hon. Senator said in pursuance of an interjection: &#x201C;We can only expect that sort of cowardice from that hon. Senator.&#x201D;</p>

<p>That is right; I heard it I have checked if that is so. That distinguished Senator strenuously denied in that debate that he had used the word &#x201C;cowardice&#x201D;. In reply to a question by you, Mr. President he said he had used the word &#x201C;courage&#x201D;. He denied it Sir, I now ask the hon. Senator Henderson to reconsider his opinion as to the so-called integrity of his colleague whom he praised so highly yesterday. Mr. President, that is the person who uses words here and then strenuously denies that he used them. This was said in the hearing of all the hon. Senators on this side of the House. If he was an inexperienced speaker, without any training, we could have accepted that perhaps he did not realize what he was saying. But he is an experienced person when it comes to the making of speeches. I think he is also a person who chooses his words.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I do not want to leave the hon. Senator Crook at that. The next day he stood up and said that after he had checked his Hansard speech, he found that he had used those words in the heat of the debate. But do you realize, Mr. President, that the words &#x201C;cowardice from that hon. Senator&#x201D; have been omitted from the published Hansard? I am not making the allegation that the hon. Senator Crook removed them, but Sir, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that those words are not included in the published Hansard. He is a person who is so quick &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. President, I can appreciate the hon. Senator&#x2019;s nervousness. As far as I am concerned, our English-speaking friends have a very good proverb. They have taught me that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. I do not like attacking people as I am doing this afternoon. That hon. Senator has not only tried to bring the leader of my party in Natal into discredit; he has also tried to bring a personal friend of mine into discredit. That is why I feel it is my duty as a senior member of the NP in Natal to respond to this sort of witchhunt they are now carrying on.</p>

Of his friend, Derek Taylor, they said that he had acted in an extremely irresponsible way.

<p>Outside the Erasmus Commission. But you will find that they do not have the courage to testify because they say they only have hearsay evidence and it will not be accepted by a commission. Do that hon. Senator and his friends expect this House and the public of South Africa to condemn an esteemed Minister on hearsay evidence? What is the point they are trying to make? No, Mr. President, I think the time has come when we in this Upper House should take note of the speech which the hon. Senator Horak made in this House yesterday. Yesterday he said two or three times: &#x201C;I feel like becoming physically ill.&#x201D; That is the effect this sort of debating has on the hon. Senator. And I can assure you, Sir, that we on this side of the House have also had enough of this sort of attack. If the hon. Senator Crook has something to put before the commission it is not necessary for him to be subpoenaed; it is not necessary for him to challenge us to use our influence with the commission to invite him to give evidence there. He can go to the commission of his own free will and testify, and we on this side of the House will welcome it.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#scheepers">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>I want to speak mainly on unemployment. This is the second time I am referring to it, but last time I was unable to finish my speech. I also want to speak on training and productivity. The position is that we have a crucial situation as far as unemployment is concerned and it is of the utmost importance that priority should be given to this matter. In South Africa unemployment does not only mean hardship to the unemployed but it also carries the additional hazard of unrest and racial strife. Not only are we faced with a large number of unemployed who were working and then lost their jobs; we are also faced with about 220 000 to 230 000 newcomers to the labour market who cannot find jobs. In addition there are a very large number of Black and Coloured unemployed. In the case of the Coloureds the figure is estimated to be 150 000, although the official figure gives the number as 73 000. The leaders of the Coloured community, however, maintain that it is 150 000. Unfortunately, our figures are not all reliable and therefore it is very difficult to decide which figure is the correct one. We also have young White men coming back from border duty who find it difficult to obtain employment. As far as they are concerned I feel that it is of the utmost importance that centres should be set up to improve the educational standards of some of them as I read in the Press not long ago that many of them have not even reached Std. 8. I feel that they should be trained for jobs and that training centres must be set up, as well as educational centres, to assist these young men when they are released from border duty.</p>
<p>The official figure is far off the mark, particularly as far as Blacks are concerned, but this also applies to Whites and Coloureds. Firstly, all Blacks do not register, for various reasons, but mainly out of fear of being endorsed out as idlers from the urban areas. Other workers do not re-register after six months when their unemployment insurance benefits cease. I have had personal experience of this, particularly in Kimberley where the figure for unemployment is shown as having dropped. The two main employers particularly of female workers in Kimberley are two clothing factories. There was a heavy retrenchment and after six months these workers had not found other employment, although according to the Department of Labour the figure had fallen. It is not the fault of the department if the figures are inaccurate. They give the figures according to the number of people who register, and I just want to point out that once the six months benefit period expires, the workers do not register again because they can obtain no further benefits. As far as I know, workers have never been told by the Department of Labour that they can apply for an extension of benefits. They can obtain these benefits, particularly those who have never been unemployed and may become unemployed for the first time. I would like to ask that people be properly informed as to their rights, it is not fair that people who have contributed for 30 years to the fund should find if they become unemployed that they can only receive benefits for six months and, if they remain unemployed through no fault of their own, they are deprived of extended benefits.</p>
<p>It is not only the Opposition which is concerned about this dangerous position. There are also people like Dr. Simon Brand, the economic adviser to the Prime Minister, Prof. Wiehahn, the chairman of the commission of inquiry into labour legislation, academics, senior business executives and the trade unions. Dr. Brand stressed recently that South Africa must continue to receive foreign capital and that labour bottlenecks must be removed. He pointed out that the bottleneck in regard to skilled labour imposes growth restraint. This is a question which this side of the House has raised many times. Unless we have skilled labour we are not able to generate labour for the lower strata of workers. Successive economic development programmes have spelt out clearly that South Africa&#x2019;s gross domestic product has to grow by 6% to create jobs for all new entrants to the labour market. In my opinion we should grow by between 6%-7%. With our limited skilled resources it is not possible to provide all the skills immediately, but I do hope as a result of the Wiehahn report that more training of skilled workers will take place because I fear if we have an economic upsurge we will certainly not have sufficient skilled workers to really boost our economy to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>One of the problems in tackling unemployment is that we do not have accurate statistics. Last year, Mr. Dreyer, the Unemployment Insurance Commissioner, revealed an unemployment figure for Black men and women was 43 912. This was the number of people registered with the fund. As I have pointed out, Sir, many unemployed do not register. The Department of Statistics estimated that there were 519 000 unemployed Blacks and 73 000 unemployed Coloureds, which is 8,6% of the economically active Coloured population.</p>
<p>A University of Natal lecturer, Mr. Charles Simpkins, claimed that there were 2,2 million people unemployed. This places all of us in a most difficult position and I feel that we should try to do something to get proper statistics in respect of the number of unemployed people. Prof. Van der Walt of the Economic Bureau of the University of Pretoria estimates that 15% of urban Blacks are without jobs. The Economic Bureau says that 9,8% of the economically active Blacks are unemployed. It is also estimated that between 220 000 and 230 000 workers enter the labour market annually. If these people cannot find employment within a reasonable period they lose the discipline to which they were accustomed at school. This also applies to unemployed people generally. If they are continuously unemployed they become workshy and, when they do find employment, it is difficult to get them to accept industrial discipline again. This question of providing jobs for these people is becoming a real problem, Sir.</p>
<p>I do not want to say much about the Riekert and Wiehahn reports because we will have an opportunity to discuss them at a later stage. In any case, we only received those reports last week and this week and I do not think any hon. Senator has had a full opportunity of studying those reports. We shall have an opportunity to discuss them fully at a later stage. However, from the little I have gleaned from those reports, the recommendations contained in them seem to be a tremendous improvement on what we have today.</p>
<p>I am concerned about one matter which I looked for especially in the Riekert Commission&#x2019;s report. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and of Environmental Planning and Energy will appreciate the point I want to make. I refer to section 3 of the Environment Planning Act. Although a great deal of restraint is going to be removed, it seems to me that there is still going to be some restraint. The hon. the Minister of Environmental Planning and Energy said in the Other Place the other day that approximately 5 000 people were kept out of work owing to this section of the Act. That was in the Transvaal. Nine hundred and seventy-four applications were received in terms of the Act to establish new plants and 653 to extend existing factories. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister of Environmental Planning and Energy is present. In the case of new plants 877 applications were granted and 556 in the case of the extension of existing factories; 77 and 73 respectively were refused. That cost 4 611 Blacks the opportunity of filling new jobs.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to rid ourselves of this albatross, section 3. I gain the impression from the reports that employers and employees should be more free to try to boost our economy by providing more work opportunities. Having made numerous appeals, I am very happy to be able to say that the hon. the Minister of Environmental Planning and Energy has been good enough to exempt the clothing industry from that section. I can assure him that already there is greater life in the industry than before because the work force in that industry had shrunk from 26 500 to 18 500. I do not think it was the intention to allow anything like that to happen in well-organized industries, industries that were producing and, in the case of industries like the clothing industry, that was already exporting. A few years ago the clothing industry exported garments to the value of only R3 million. I am happy to say that last year they exported garments to the value of R20 million. However, because of the difficulties experienced in the Transvaal due to section 3 of the Environment Planning Act only R2 million worth of these exports came from the Transvaal. I think we should look for more export markets. The wages and salaries paid in factories and secondary industry are far lower than they are in Europe. But if we see to it that our people are properly trained and produce to their full potential I think we can compete with many of the older industrialized countries.</p>
<p>Dr. Adendorf, the Director of the Corporation for Economic Development, was optimistic when he stated recently that the objective to provide 15 000 industrial jobs per annum in the Black states was in sight and that this, together with ancillary workers, would provide jobs for 45 000 people. Since the beginning of decentralization, which was in 1952-&#x2019;53 if my memory serves me correctly, 10 060 jobs have been provided in those decentralized areas. The Corporation stated further that they had allowed three years for which they had not accounted. I can quite understand their doing so, because the first three years of a factory in such a decentralized area are usually very uneconomic until such time as the workers have fallen into the industrial pattern.</p>
<p>It is expected that they will be able to provide 94 000 jobs per annum. In addition 126 000 jobs were provided for Coloureds and Asians and 11 700 for Whites. Dr. Adendorff admits that industrialists have either circumvented the requirements of the Environment Planning Act or else they have opted for capital incentive production. That is correct, Sir. Where industrialists could invest more capital and not decentralize they have done so. Dr. Adendorff also says that because of this, decentralization has been affected to a large extent and has become self-defeating. I think we should encourage decentralization as much as possible but it is no good forcing labour intensive industries to mechanize because that will only mean that many people will lose their jobs. I think people should be encouraged to decentralize and not coerced to do so because that will never work. If they are forced to decentralize, the factories will either mechanize or move to areas where there are large industries already, such as the Cape Province or Natal. The clothing industry has been most prosperous in those two areas. They will ultimately attract more people, more Black people and the Government&#x2019;s objective of influx control will be defeated because of this decentralization. It costs the Corporation an average of R7 000 to create one job in a small town or border area. They expect that they will require R1 500 million merely to keep pace with the new job seekers entering the labour market. According to the Industrial Development Corporation, it costs R1 561 to create one job in a country town, R8 801 in fringe border areas and R9 946 in recognized growth points. I should like to see that growth points for Coloured people are encouraged in areas such as Bloemfontein and Kimberley. However, it is not easy to get employers to even go to those areas and we fear that some of the factories there may even have to close down. If assistance can be given to those factories to provide work it should definitely be done.</p>
<p>If the Government had taken the advice of this side of the House many years ago, I feel that we would not have had the flow of Black people to the big cities that we have today. If one is starving and has to provide for a family, one will try and go where one can find work. But we on this side have suggested long ago that as soon as the Government started with its homelands policy they should allow White capital to help to develop these areas. Ultimately the Government always takes our advice. This has been the case time and again. They merely delay things far too long, which is not in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>No, there was not such a strong influx at that time, not as strong as it is today. [Interjections.] I should like to quote what Professor Van Jaarsveld said on 13 September last year. This appeared in <i>Die</i> <i>Vaderland</i> and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Die Nasionale Party se beleid is net &#x2018;n terugkeer na die ou Smuts-visie van die veertigerjare. Die Afrikaner was daardie tyd nie ryp genoeg om so &#x2019;n beleid te aanvaar nie, maar beweeg nou stadig in dié rigting. Indien die beginsels van generaal Smuts daardie tyd aanvaar was, sou dit baie van ons probleme vandag uitgeskakel het.</block>
<p>Furthermore Professor Van Jaarsveld says the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Die Nasionale Party-beleid is net &#x2019;n ompad van wat genl. Smuts en J. A. Hofmeyr toentertyd in gedagte gehad het.</block>

<p>Professor Kriek says the following, and I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Genl. Smuts het die embrio vir &#x2019;n plurale bestel daargestel. Ons internasionale posisie sou baie sterker gewees het en dit sou moontlik gewees het dat genl. Smuts die drie protektorate ook by Suid-Afrika sou kry.</block>
<p>These are people from outside, academicians, who are thinking along these lines.</p>
<p>†With the new dispensation that will arise from the Wiehahn Commission Report, education and training will have to be high on our priority list. At the conference of chartered accountants held recently in Cape Town, both Dr. Simon Brand and Mr. Aubrey Dickman, the economic consultant of Anglo American, stressed that to close the gap between White and Black living standards tremendous expansion of Black educational facilities must be provided. I know that the Government is trying to give a better quality of education and I think we should all welcome it, because I know that some White teachers are today teaching the Black students in Soweto, which is of great benefit to those students. However, the type of education which the Blacks received in the past, where teachers started teaching children whilst only having a Std. 8 qualification themselves, was in my estimation not the quality of teaching that we required for our multiracial country to educate our potential labour force.</p>
<p>Dr. Simon Brand also described the unemployment position as a reality with unacceptable social and political implications. I agree with that one hundred per cent, because if we cannot provide more employment opportunities, training or education and hope for these people, our whole social system, and our whole political system will be in danger. I am looking forward to a new era, because I feel that the ground has been broken and we are going to enter a new era. We will be able, if we move a bit faster, to create a happy South Africa where there will be co-operation instead of confrontation between all our racial groups.</p>
<p>We maintain, and to some extent it is true, that our Black people here &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; are better off than in other Black countries. The International Monetary Fund found that 40% of our people are amongst those who are the worst off in the world. I hope that with all the new visions we have, we will be able to rectify that matter and that South Africa will prove that it can provide for all its peoples.</p>
<p>The present spending in regard to training and education is far too low. The Wiehahn Commission report stressed this fact, whilst the National Productivity Institute maintains that we must increase expenditure in this regard by 900%. For that we require some R200 million. We only spend R2 per head on training, whereas Australia, Britain, West Germany, Sweden, France and Ireland spend on average R16 per head per economically active person.</p>
<p>The Report also calls for the establishment of one training body to oversee all training of Whites and non-Whites. I regret very much that when the clothing industry started a training college in 1968, we were ultimately forced by the Department of Bantu Education to stop training workers. As far as the Whites in the industry were concerned, they occupied the management, middle management and supervisory positions. At first we did not have many Coloured people in these positions, but in the course of time quite a large number of Indian people attained senior positions. However, the ordinary operators, handymen, machinist, etc., were mostly Black people. It was a pity because some of the managers that college turned out are today already directors. In some companies they proved to be invaluable in their task of managing factories.</p>
<p>The productivity report calls for the establishment of an industrial training agency and I feel this should be the overall one which they are suggesting. Unless we treat education and training of a free labour force as priority number one, our productivity will remain low. I feel we should do everything within our power to increase our productivity and I can assure this Government that the trade unions with which I am connected, will give their full support towards productivity drives. We can only achieve high productivity if the people have at least a certain amount of education and if they have had proper training. Therefore we should do better than we have done up to the present.</p>
<p>The IMF also found that we have made less progress than many other non-oil producing countries such as Taiwan, Singapore, Korea and others. Professor Carlisle, a former senior lecturer at the University of the North who is now administrative director of production management, says that it is economically untenable to close the wage gap simply for sociological or moral reasons.

<p>Mr. President, I ask the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers to excuse me for not replying at this stage to the statements which she has made and the arguments she raised relevant to certain aspects of my responsibilities as Minister of Economic Affairs and of Environmental Planning and Energy. However, I hasten to assure her that I should like to have the opportunity of discussing them with her. In fact, I would rather have a discussion with the hon. Senator than discuss the unsavoury subject the hon. Senator Crook dealt with in his speech.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>I asked the hon. Senator Crook to be here.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>It really makes no difference whether he is here or not. I want to begin by saying that our public life is often tainted and soured outside because of the fact that in an uncontrolled and irresponsible way&#x2014;without publishing lies&#x2014;the truth is withheld. People in public life are defamed by suggestion and innuendo. There are few of us in public life who do not realize the risks attached to that sort of life. But nobody can propagate codes of conduct and approve of something aimed at vilifying people in public life without having any factual basis. What disturbs me is that this vilification and reprehensible conduct not only affects the person who is the subject of it but it also affects what he represents. It not only has an adverse effect on individuals but it also adversely affects the institutions represented by those individuals. I want to say to hon. Senators opposite that they themselves, their predecessors and their party have been the victims of this conduct. I want to warn them seriously lest through their conduct they become partners in the sort of conduct which all of us must eradicate from our lives and which we ought to condemn in the strongest terms.</p>
<p>For that reason I find that the actions of the hon. Senator Crook are to be condemned. I want to couple this not only with his actions this afternoon but also with the fact that in a planned manner he is waging a vexatious action against one of his colleagues in this hon. House. I can begin with the motion which appeared on the Order Paper of this hon. House on 3 May. This is the motion that appeared in the name of the hon. Senator. I think I must read it so that I can put my point It reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That, in view, <i>inter alia</i>, of the evidence contained in the Interim Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Irregularities in the Former Department of Information, this House is of the opinion that the Minister of Finance was at all material times aware of irregularities relating to the former Department of Information.</block>
<p>And what did the hon. Senator do then, Sir? He cannot plead in innocence that he made statements in the heat of the moment which he would not have made in a calmer atmosphere of consideration. Sir, he drew up a document which necessarily testifies to enormous study. This document, which was supposed to be his speech on this particular occasion, he had circulated to the Press. He did not put an embargo on the Press regarding the time of publication of this document He gave it to the Press. And, Sir, the speech which the hon. Senator made this afternoon is a repetition of the document which he handed to the Press. What the hon. Senator has said or can say in the privileged circumstances of this House are not necessarily things which can be said outside the privilege of Parliament.</p>
<p>When the hon. Senator Crook found he could not deliver his speech, he did not have the fundamental decency to ask for that document to be returned. He left the matter at that. Now I ask myself to what level is it possible for a person to sink in his hatred and disregard for other people? I ask myself to what extent conduct of this sort makes us instruments and accomplices of those who want to bring about anarchy and chaos in the country? [Interjections.] I am controlling myself now because I should not like to do the same sort of thing the hon. Senator has done; I should like to maintain the honoured rules of the House. But I ask myself when we in this Upper House are going to reach the point where we will be prepared to put our country before the political points we think we can make against one another?</p>
<p>Sir, the conduct of the hon. Senator was reprehensible; the conduct of the hon. Senator is to be condemned; the conduct of the hon. Senator is unworthy of this institution; the conduct of this hon. Senator must be seriously censured in any decent company.</p>
<p>Secondly, with regard to this motion on the Order Paper, a report appeared in an English-language newspaper the following day containing the statements of two hon. Senators. In the first place I take it that both these hon. edifying Senators with these ostensibly high moral codes have read the report, because up to now I have not seen a denial or repudiation of that report. And what is the essence of the hon. Senator Webber&#x2019;s statement in this newspaper? Let me tell him now that I expected a greater degree of responsibility from him than from the hon. Senator Crook. But he must not think I am complimenting him, Sir, because the norm I judge by is low. But, after all, he is a leader, even if he is only the leader of the political remains in a province. But let us look at what the hon. Senator said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">His colleague, Senator Warwick Webber, said the government was aware &#x2026; (this is a statement of fact) that he and Senator Crook would have presented &#x201C;sufficient evidence to question certain findings of the Erasmus Commission&#x201D;.</block>
<p>†Let me repeat this, Sir. It says that the Government was aware that this hon. Senator and his colleague would submit evidence to this hon. House to question certain findings of the Erasmus Commission. This statement presupposes certain things. In the first place it presupposes that both these hon. Senators had evidence that they could submit to this hon. House. It also presupposes that they would then be able to put it to the Erasmus Commission. But let us deal with the first issue first. I would then naturally suppose, Sir, that the hon. Senator who had been deprived of the opportunity to submit his evidence to this hon. House, would take the first opportunity to present such evidence. I submit further that we would have expected from him that he would submit that evidence to this House today. Sir, I submit in all sincerity that the hon. Senator possesses no evidence, and if he does he is deliberately withholding it from this hon. House.</p>

[Interjections.] Sir, I did not interrupt hon. Senators while they were speaking. They must just listen. Firstly, the hon. Senator did not produce one iota of evidence.</p>
<p>*What the hon. Senator in fact did, Sir, was to advance a long, confused legal argument in which he questioned the findings of the Erasmus Commission.

Senator done further? This man who has evidence in regard to one of his colleagues having committed fraud and perjury&#x2014;what does he do? And what should he do? Now I say to him that he like any other Senator here is bound to ensure that people who make themselves guilty of these offences should not hold public office. If he is not prepared to do that, Sir, then he does not deserve to be here. What means are now open to the hon. Senator to exercise his responsibility as a citizen of the country and as a member of the House? I say it is his responsibility at the first and best opportunity to lay the evidence of fraud and the evidence of perjury before the proper authority which can judge the truth or otherwise thereof.</p>

<from>*The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS AND OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND ENERGY:</from>
<p>Sir, is that not the most ludicrous interjection from the hon. Senator Henderson? How many witnesses who have given evidence before the Erasmus Commission have been subpoenaed? Sir, I shall tell you why the hon. Senator is not going to give evidence. The first reason is that he has no evidence to give. He has no factual evidence to give. What is said in this report about the evidence he and the hon. Senator Webber have is not true. Secondly, he would not be able to stand up to questioning under oath. I make this accusation against him and I also make it against the hon. Senator Webber. But there is a more important reason, perhaps, and that is the most reprehensible of all, namely that the hon. Senator prefers a public hearing in this hysterical atmosphere of the masses. I want to warn the hon. Senator. There is a proverb which says: He who digs a pit for somebody else will fall into it himself. I would really be ashamed of myself, Sir, if the accusations I make today against the hon. Senator Crook. were to be made against me.</p>
<p>I want to take this further. There is a fourth reason why the hon. Senator does not have the courage to give evidence before the commission of inquiry, and that is that he would then have to discard the political advantage of innuendos. He would then have to dispense with the opportunity he has of participating in a general method of vilification without evidence. If this hon. Minister of Finance or anybody else is guilty of the crimes which the hon. Senator accuses my colleague of, then there is no place for him or anybody else in public life and I would not have risen to take part in the debate. I am not putting the case of any single person, Sir. I am putting the country&#x2019;s case to you. Sir, I am putting to you the case of the institutions which have to serve the country. I am putting the case of those people who serve in those institutions, all the Senators. I am putting the case for uprightness. Sir, I am putting the case for codes of conduct which are universal among decent, educated people.</p>

<p>I do not want to argue with the hon. Senator. I am putting his case too. The fact remains that the quality of the institutions which have to serve a country is determined by the quality of the people they use to serve them.</p>
<p>There are serious dangers in actions like those of the hon. Senator Crook Do you know what the greatest danger is, Sir? It is that decent people, who are also fallible, will avoid public life because they do not want to become the target of such reprehensible actions. I am also putting the case of the hon. Senator Crook himself. I am putting his case for him, because he, more than other hon. Senators in this House, is professionally qualified to deal with the truth by reason of his training as a lawyer. Why does he find such difficulty in consorting with the truth?</p>
<p>I want to put the case of the hon. Senator from a second point of view, namely his concepts of fairness and justice. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we have been unfortunate enough this afternoon to view a masterly display of unrighteous indignation. We have had here this afternoon the new clown prince of Parliament, who has been sent in to try in some way to salvage something of the honour of the Government in this terrible affair, the Information scandal. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs says that the attacks by the hon. Senator Crook do not just hurt Horwood, but also the Government and the Republic of South Africa, and that they in fact harm the dignity of this House. And I agree with him entirely. However, if it were not for the cover-up of the Government, if it were not for the fact that every bit of information which we have been able to glean in this unfortunate affair, has been dragged from the Government as if by a span of 16 oxen, we would not have been placed in this position. I want to say to that hon. Minister and to this House in all sincerity that we are not convinced that the hon. Senator Horwood is not more concerned in this affair than he will admit. I say it in all sincerity, Sir. It is for that reason that we feel, in the interests of the country, in the interests of truth and veracity, in the interests of the very points which the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs makes, that it is essential that this House should have every opportunity to debate all the facts which become available to it, no matter from what source.</p>

<p>It does not matter how many years it takes until the Government ceases the cover-up. It is for that reason that we have tried to carry this out. Let me hasten to add that the harm which has been done to all these institutions&#x2014;and I agree with the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs&#x2014;has been as a direct result of the actions of the Government and what has happened.</p>

<p>Of course, we persist. However, the harm has been done by the Government and Government members, and not by the Opposition. [Interjections.] I will come to that in a minute.</p>
<p>We have the unfortunate situation here this afternoon where notes of a speech which he intended to make, had been given by the hon. Senator Crook to members of the Press. Convention has always held that such notes are embargoed until the speech is delivered. The integrity of the Press has required that they should keep those notes confidential until such time as they are delivered. It would appear that, not only on one but on two occasions, members of the Press have chosen to hand notes of hon. members of my party to hon. Ministers for their use before such speeches were delivered. Sir, I do not for one moment justify that behaviour on the part of the members of the Press. However, what I find despicable, in the words of this hon. Minister, is the misuse of that information by Ministers on that side of the House.</p>

We attempted to do so last Thursday but were precluded from doing so. We tried again this afternoon.

<p>Let me say then that if that hon.

Sir, I want to add that that is what motivated the walk-out on Thursday; that is what motivated the motion that we had earlier, but we have had that debate before.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, I want to come to the main point of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. He alleges that there was an ulterior motive in the fact that the hon. Senator Crook left a word out when he read this particular judgement and the principle that is involved in the case of <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Myers.</i> Let me say right here and now on behalf of the hon. Senator Crook that he admits that he left that word out. It was done deliberately. It was done for a reason. It was done, Sir, because if he had said to you that the fact entertained by the representer&#x2014;being the hon. Senator Horwood&#x2014;may have been itself the outcome of a fraudulent diligence in ignorance, you would not have allowed it.</p>

<p>No. I have as much time as that hon. Minister has for questions. Let me make my case, Sir. I believe on very good authority, Sir, that whether one includes the word &#x201C;fraudulent&#x201D; or not is immaterial to the case because it goes further and it describes this particular frame of mind, namely&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; of a wilful abstention from all sources of information which might lead to a suspicion, and a sedulous avoidance of all possible avenues to the truth, for the express purpose of not having any doubt thrown on what he desires and is determined to, and afterwards does (in a sense) believe.</block>
<p>Let me say, Sir, that if one reads this with the word &#x201C;fraudulent&#x201D; or without, it makes no difference whatsoever to the principle concerned. But it was in acknowledgement of the rules of this House that that word was left out of the notes of the hon. Senator Crook&#x2019;s speech. The hon. the Minister of Finance laughs but let me say that I believe that that quite clearly applies to him. The evidence in the first and interim reports of the Erasmus Commission bears that out, as will subsequent reports. There is also his own admission in the Other Place earlier during this session, that he sedulously avoided anything.</p>

<p>Mr. President, when this debate was adjourned yesterday, I was dealing with the speech of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs concerning particularly the part that the hon. the Minister of Finance had played in the Information scandal.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance has stomped backwards and forwards between the Senate and the Other Place, and has stomped from platform to platform outside this Parliament, complaining bitterly about lies and untruths and the unjust allegations that have been made against him. I think the time has come to point out to the hon. the Minister that he has his recourse, both in this place and outside, and he knows what it is. I think the time has come for him to stop his threats and allegations and to do something about it.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sir. There is no doubt that there was collusion between the then Prime Minister, Mr. John Vorster, the then Minister of Information, Dr. Connie Mulder, and the then Minister of Finance, the late Dr. Diederichs. There was collusion among those three to use public funds in a manner other than that for which they had been budgeted. The hon. the Minister of Defence, the present Prime Minister, Mr. P. W. Botha, found himself involved in this, unwillingly, and we accept that. When Senator Owen Horwood became Minister of Finance he found himself in a situation which he had inherited.

<p>In the illegal transfer of money out of which arose the misappropriation and out of which arose the wrongful use of public money for party political purposes. He was involved in it, and then he wonders why we attack him! He says it is a personal vendetta, but I feel that those facts must be pointed out to this House. It is not a question of a personal vendetta. It could have been anybody on those benches who happened to fill that seat. He is the only one left and represents the whole illegal arrangement. That is why he happens to be the person who is attacked. He is attacked as a Minister of Finance and not in his personal capacity. It is, therefore, not a personal vendetta as he claims it to be.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has only himself to blame for the contradictory and conflicting statements which have been made. These have been pointed out repeatedly and I do not have to repeat them again in this place. I want now to say the last word that I intend saying on this sorry episode, at least until after the final report of the Erasmus Commission has been received.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Really, Mr. President, I do not know why the hon. the Minister is so sensitive about this thing. Do you wonder why we are so suspicious when he is so sensitive?</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister in his budget has made concessions totalling near R1 000 million, and, Sir, he has presented what I want to call a delayed action budget. Those concessions totalling nearly R1 000 million are spread over a year and, in fact, most people will only feel the benefit of them at the end of the year. This budget is clearly stimulatory and as such it has been welcomed, but I am afraid that the benefit of many of these stimulatory measures which he has taken is going to be negated by Government action, by the Government&#x2019;s failure to contain and control the inflation rate prevailing at the moment.</p>
<p>When we realize that from March 1978 to March 1979 the inflation rate was in excess of 12%, then we must know what we were dealing with at the time of the budget&#x2019;s presentation. What has happened since then? This is what I would like to talk to the Government and the hon. the Minister about this afternoon. I believe that the increases and particularly the increases in administered prices&#x2014;the prices of administered products&#x2014; are going to negate completely any concessions which the hon. the Minister may have made in his budget.</p>
<p>Let us start with the question of eggs which is topical at the moment. In this case I believe that there is a responsibility resting upon the Government at the moment to take drastic action as soon as possible. It is unfortunate that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture has not been able to attend this afternoon. It is not his fault; I concede that; but it would have been nice to have him here and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister or somebody will convey the message to him.</p>
<p>The time has come for him to make an investigation of Nepco, the egg producers&#x2019; co-operative which has been formed. I am wholly in favour of the co-operative marketing of agricultural products, but I am not in favour of the use of the co-operative system to create a monopoly. Co-operatives should operate on a regional basis and not on a national basis where they create a monopoly and where they, then, Sir, are able to dictate not only to the consumers but to the producers as well. They have arbitrarily decided to increase the price of eggs. We were told originally that it was going to be 8 cents per dozen; then we were told it was going to be 4 cents per dozen. Now it is rumoured there will be no increase. We do not know. The operative date is 14 May when those who are in business will receive their eggs and will only know then what the new price is going to be.</p>
<p>At the moment Nepco is charging retailers 57 cents a dozen for large eggs, and 60 cents a dozen for extra large eggs, and these are being retailed at a fair price in the chain stores and supermarkets at 66 cents and 70 cents a dozen respectively, plus 3 cents for sales tax. I believe they are discounting to the chains at a cost of 56 cents and 59 cents, respectively, for large and extra large eggs. But, Sir, there is still a surplus, and they have decided, notwithstanding the massive surplus of eggs, to increase the prices. I would like to demand of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture today, or the hon. the Minister of Finance, who also has the power, to do something about freezing the price of eggs before the increase is made. I do not believe the Government can wait until after the price is increased before they take action to freeze.</p>
<p>Why do I say this, Sir? Because we have the situation where we have a surplus of eggs which is costing the country nearly R9 million to export at a loss. Those eggs are bought in from the producers at plus-minus 40 cents a dozen&#x2014;28 cents a kilo is the price paid by the Egg Board for those surplus eggs. Now, of course, Nepco is reported to have compelled a producer who had surplus eggs which he was unable to sell at a price of between 56 cents and 59 cents a dozen, to hand them over to Nepco to pass on to the board at 40 cents a dozen, whereas he wished to dispose of his surplus eggs in the Black rural areas. But he was forbidden to do so by Nepco. This is where the absolute power of such a national co-operative becomes immoral and where it is incorrect. It has the power to stop that producer from selling his eggs at a reduced price which I believe it is doing. I believe the hon. the Minister should look into that aspect as well and stop it right away.</p>
<p>I believe that the hon. the Minister should have this inquiry made right away but at the same time I believe that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture has the solution to the problem in his hands. Some time ago the hon. the Minister piloted a Bill through this House which allowed him to control the number of laying hens. He applied that Act for some years and then he stopped doing so. Administratively he has not applied the Act and that is the reason we have a surplus of eggs today.</p>
<p>I believe that the blame for that must be placed at the door of the hon. the Minister for having allowed these people to collect more and more hens. He has also allowed a scheme under which producers are allowed to produce without looking for a market and simply dump their eggs on the board. The housewives have in consequence to pay 4 cents per dozen in the form of a levy for the eggs they purchase today. Eggs are being exported at a loss today, Sir, while Nepco, the co-operative society that is supposed to be looking after the interests of the egg-producing industry, will not allow the producers to sell at a lower price to the under-privileged people of this country. I believe that this is a scandalous situation that has developed and that it requires the urgent attention not only of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture but of the whole Cabinet.</p>
<p>Let me say at once that I am acutely aware of the situation in which the egg farmers find themselves today due to the escalating costs of production. I believe that the greatest disservice has been done to them and to other sectors of the agricultural industry by this massive increase of 22% in the price of maize. We will know what that is going to do to the production costs of all those persons who are using maize as a basic commodity from which to produce food. I have spoken about the egg producers. One also has the broiler producer, Sir, the beef farmers, the dairy farmers, mutton farmers, pork producers and so forth. Those people face tremendous increases in the cost of production of their commodities. I believe this increase is going to lead to an increase of approximately 3 cents per litre on milk, 4 cents per dozen on eggs and 3 cents per kilogram on chicken, beef, mutton and pork.</p>

<p>What is your solution?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>I shall come to that in a moment. The hon. Senator must not be impatient This is the situation that we have at the moment. We also have a cost of living spiral which showed an increase of 12,6% in the year from March 1978 to March 1979. That was even before these increases in the price of basic foodstuffs. Where are we going, Sir? We have already had the situation where the cost-of-living index rose by 1,7% from February to March of this year. If that is projected over a year, it will amount to an increase of over 20% in the cost of living over 12 short months. I do not believe the -people of South Africa can absorb that sort of increase in their cost of living and I believe that the Government should do something about curtailing it This 1,7% in one month was before any of the increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs. That was caused only by the fuel levy imposed by the Government and the general sales tax which was another action on the part of the Government As I have said, we now have an increase of R18 per ton in respect of maize or 22%. Coupled with that there has been an increase in the price to producers of R42 per ton or 12% in the case of groundnuts, R32 per ton or 17% in the case of sunflower seed and R31 per ton or 15% in the case of soya seed. Hon. Senators must realize what these two increases, linked with the other increases, mean to the poorer people of this country, people whose staple diet is maize, whose basic foodstuff is maize or maize products. They rely on these oils to provide them with the necessary proteins and fats. It is this Government that allowed the introduction of yellow margarine so that they could have a low price fat It was the hon. the Minister of Health who announced it. He said that the poorer people deserved a lower-price fat. What is this increase going to mean to margarine? I can only speculate as regards margarine. What is it going to mean to oil? I recently received the new prices of cooking oil, and while we have been selling a 750 ml bottle of cooking oil for 85 cents for some time now, i.e. for a year or more, when my next consignment arrives it is going to cost me 89 cents. That will be my cost price. The cost price to the retailer is going to be higher than the present retail price. It means that a bottle of oil will now have to be sold for more than R1 per bottle, and the supermarkets will be discounting it at that price. This tremendous increase in the price of maize is going to add to that. I do not know how the poorer people are going to be able to continue. One can imagine the untold misery that this is going to cause. I believe that the Government has to do something to cushion the effect of these increases on the consumers.</p>
<p>The first thing they can do, is to look at the maize which is at the moment stored in the silos. There are thousands of tons of last season&#x2019;s maize still stored in those silos and that maize is now being sold at the new price that has been increased by R18 per ton. R18 per ton is going into the maize stabilization fund for every ton of that old maize which is sold. I believe that the first step that this Government must do, is to sell last season&#x2019;s maize to food producers, to the egg producers, the chicken farmers, the beef pro ducers and mutton and pork producers; in other words, those who are producing food from maize, and that they should be able to buy that maize at the old price. That, of course, is going to reduce their input costs and that will eliminate the possibility of any further price increases in basic commodities, which has not yet happened. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I rise, in fact, to refer in sorrow to a portion of the speech made in this House three days ago by the hon. Senator Swanepoel as the main speaker of the NRP, the official Opposition. I am sorry that the hon. Senator Swanepoel is not here at the moment. In his reply to the budget speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance three days ago, he said the following. I quote from the Hansard report of his speech&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Die bietjie kontak wat ek met die sakelewe het, het my oortuig dat die edele Minister se beeld glad nie na wense is onder die sakemanne wat ek ken nie.</block>
<p>Mr. President, before I go on, I want to pay tribute to the honesty of the hon. Senator Swanepoel because when he says that he has &#x201C;bietjie kontak&#x201D; (some contact) with the business world, he is saying in fact that his contact is insignificant.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. M. VAN SCHOOR</person>:</from>
<p>I cannot repeat it; my time is too limited. I am just referring to the speech of the hon. Senator Swanepoel in reply to the budget speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance in which he spoke with great honesty about the small measure of contact he had with the business world. On the basis of that little measure of contact he says that the image of the Minister of Finance leaves much to be desired in the eyes of the business world. I am grateful to the hon. Senator for being honest enough to admit that his contact is very insignificant.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel went on and said something very strange. Once again I quote from the Hansard report of his speech in which he said the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Ek voel dat ons nooit ons ekonomie ten volle sal kan ontwikkel tensy ons in hierdie geval ook &#x2019;n verandering maak nie. Ek sê dit met al die erns tot my beskikking. Ek is glad nie ligsinnig daaroor nie.</block>
<p>He then proceeded in all seriousness to tell the House what changes should be effected and, having admitted that he had some contact with the business world, he advised the hon. the Minister to hand in his resignation to the hon. the Prime Minister. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I want to know from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Oelrich and the hon. Senator Horak whether they support this statement of their main speaker on finance. If they do not, will they then for the sake of truthfulness repudiate him? Because, Sir, the statement by the hon. Senator Swanepoel that the image of the hon. the Minister of Finance in the eyes of the business world of South Africa leaves much to be desired, that it is a poor one and that he should resign because of that, is completely untrue. Who are the few businessmen whom the hon. Senator knows? I am prepared to arrange a confrontation between any businessmen I know with those whom the hon. Senator Swanepoel knows. I call upon Dr. Anton Rupert in the first instance.</p>

<p>I shall not read the speech. I take it that hon. Senators read <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i>; I take it that they can read Afrikaans. I shall just read a short extract from <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i> of today. Yesterday at the junior congress of the Afrikaanse Handels-instituut in Johannesburg Dr. Rupert moved a motion of appreciation in Senator Horwood because according to him the latter, and I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; het the skyf geword van persoonlike aanvalle &#x2026;</block>
<p>Then the Opposition still has the temerity to deny that a personal vendetta is being waged against the hon. the Minister of Finance. Do they believe Dr. Rupert? If they do not accept what we say, do they accept what Dr. Rupert says? [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I can give hon. Senators of the Opposition further proof. Dr. Rupert asks why it is a personal vendetta and replies that it is because the hon. the Minister of Finance is following in the footsteps of his father who was the personal assistant to John X. Merriman at the time and the great friend of the Afrikanerbond in the Colony. Who is attacking him? They are the logical successors of Cecil John Rhodes, the man who engineered the Jameson raid. With due respect, Mr. President, I think Cecil John Rhodes would turn in his grave today if he were to see his successors in action.</p>
<p>I want to make one further quotation from what Dr. Rupert said, namely&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Ek laat nie vriende in die steek nie. Ek verkies lojaliteit en vriendskap bo geld. Dit is ook waar van die Afrikaner. Daarom my voorstel van waardering vir min. Owen Horwood. Die slag wat hy met sy jongste begroting vir vrye ondernemerskap geslaan het&#x2014;selfs vir die diamantmyne&#x2014;moet erken word.</block>
<p>†But Mr. President, these accolades of praise have not only been heaped on from the Afrikaner&#x2019;s side. I have access to&#x2014;and the hon. Senator Swanepoel can exercise that right too if he wants to&#x2014;documents from which I cannot quote unfortunately, because they are confidential. I can however tell that hon. Senator that the hon. the Minister of Finance has also received congratulations, expressions of praise and appreciation from various other centres and also from English-speaking circles not only in South Africa but in the outside world. I will quote only one of these, and the hon. Senator Swanepoel can have access to these documents should he want to see them and confirm that my quotations are authentic. There is the telegram from one of the foremost industrialists in South Africa, and hon. Senators will be surprised to learn who this is. He said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It is fortunate for South Africa that someone of your ability is available to control our financial affairs at this time.</block>
<p>Another person said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">In presenting a budget so well-knit and so well-directed, you have laid the ghost of uncertainty which has been haunting this country ever since the shroud of depression descended on us four years ago.</block>
<p>Another one says this&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">You and your aides deserve every accolade which your budget deserves.</block>
<p>&#x201C;It was tremendous,&#x201D; wires another person from very influential circles and continues&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">You have made a wonderful contribution to our welfare and our future growth prospects.</block>
<p>These messages of congratulation have come not only from financial circles in South Africa, but also from overseas. One of the most outstanding bankers in Switzerland said that he had been shocked to read a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of South Africa&#x2014;he may have been shocked, but I am not surprised&#x2014; which indicated that South Africa&#x2019;s gold policy and the Minister&#x2019;s alleged role in this so-called Information scandal had undermined the confidence of overseas investors in the Minister himself and in South Africa. He refuted the argument in this South African newspaper with contempt.</p>
<p>*That is the result, Mr. President, which, as I said recently in a speech, we should expect here in South Africa. The hon. Senator Oelrich as the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. Senator Horak as a highly esteemed member of the Opposition, should realize that when one does anything that affects the Minister of Finance in a country like South Africa one also affects the entire financial integrity and the entire structure of the country. Over the past 50 years we have not had many Ministers of Finance but every one of them has been the personification of trustworthiness, credibility and reliability in the South African economy. The Opposition can carry on with their personal attacks on the Minister of Finance but then they must face up to the charge that by doing so they are undermining the integrity of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. President, that is what we on this side of the House find so distressing. We are prepared to admit every one of our weaknesses and we are prepared to accept criticism but when campaigns are conducted at a level where persons are denigrated, when character assassination takes place, we dig in our heels. I think the businessmen of South Africa, including those in finance and mining who have seen what has been happening and who know of this sustained and continuous vendetta against the hon. Senator Horwood, our Minister of Finance, over the past days and weeks in this hon. House, should do what Dr. Anton Rupert has done and say: Thus far and no further, because what you are doing is to cast doubt on the integrity of an honourable person, and by doing that to someone who preserves and guards our financial strength, soundness and progress in such a remarkable way, you are also harming South Africa.</p>
<p>†I was most grieved, Sir. The hon. Senator Winchester said: &#x201C;How can you sit still, and say nothing.&#x201D; But as far as this character assassination is concerned, I will give another example which is really distressing. In last Sunday&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Times</i> on the front page, the following heading appears: &#x201C;Oh! Dr. Poorter! What an Odd Degree!&#x201D; I am glad his brother, the hon. Senator Laurie Poorter, is not here because now I can speak openly. This article ridicules Dr. John Poorter, editor <i>of To The Point</i> by implying very clearly that he got his honorary doctorate, that he virtually bought it, from a certain gentleman in Springs.</p>
<p>I have never seen a worse example of character assassination than this. I also have here a telex from the Rev. Trevor Swart, general secretary of the Baptist Union which says this&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Dr. John Poorter has had a distinguished academic record. He is a graduate of the Bible Institute of South Africa, Cape Province, and subsequently completed the four year theological course for ministerial recognition of the Baptist Union with honours, obtaining a higher aggregate of marks for the total course than any student previously registered with the Union. He has a B.A. with history and English majors from the University of South Africa, a B.A. Hons, in theology from the University of Natal; an M.A. <i>cum laude</i> from the University of Natal for what many have described as a brilliant thesis on the theology of C.

He holds an <i>honoris causa</i> Doctor of Divinity degree from Bob Jones University, U.S.A., in recognition of his scholarship and Christian leadership.</block>

Senator Crook comes into this House and refuses to testify under oath before the Erasmus Commission in respect of certain statements which he &#x2026; [Interjections.] He admits it is hearsay but he comes along repeatedly with quotations and complaints by a person who also refuses to testify under oath before the commission, and he uses them against the hon. the Minister.

<p>Mr. President, I am sorry that I have to raise this matter again and I sincerely trust that this will be the end of it Hon. Senators of the Opposition must realize that what has been set in motion must come to an end and we shall have to face up to that within a few weeks&#x2019; time. Thereafter we hope that we shall have a clear picture of what the position is in connection with this Information matter and that steps will be taken to put an end to these mutual recriminations and charges against Ministers, other people and Senators on this side of the House. I am Sorry but I shall have to come back to this subject at a later stage because South Africa, our country, is at the moment calling upon everyone of us, including the members of the Opposition and everyone in the country, White and Black, as well as all the countries in Southern Africa, to show a new spirit, a new desire and a new determination. We must make use of this atmosphere which has apparently suddenly changed in our favour, so that we can create a situation of peaceful co-existence and cooperation in this southern country, this subcontinent of Africa.</p>
<p>We are faced suddenly with a position in which two reports, the Wiehahn report and the Riekert report, have opened new horizons for us. There may be problems for some people in the country. [Interjections.] We only hear about the spirit that the White man must show but the Wiehahn report and the Riekert report demand above all else from the Black man, the Black spokesman and the Black leader that measure of self-discipline, self-control and recognition of the rights of others on which our country&#x2019;s future has to be built. We are faced with a position in which there has suddenly been a change in the attitude of one of the five powers who have to decide jointly on the fate of Southern Africa. I refer to Great Britain. We must not expect too much from that Government; far from it because, just like any other government, yes, just like ours, the new British Government decides on its policy, its actions and attitudes on the basis of what is in its own national interests. That also applies in the case of South Africa. But I am sure that the new Government in Britain will adopt a more realistic approach towards the problems of Southern Africa. I hope that the people of Rhodesia will find one another and that they will realize that the one thing that can destroy Rhodesia today is disunity among themselves. White and Black, Black and Black must reach the stage where they recognize one another. We are faced with a possible change in the South African situation. The position is not hopeless. It is possible that the position in South West Africa may change. The position is not hopeless, therefore, Sir. We have clear proof of that The hon. Senator Horak must admit that there is increasing dissatisfaction with the laxity of the Carter administration. Not only are we about to have a change in the attitude of countries abroad that can be to our benefit and that can assist us in solving our problems but we ourselves are also trying to create an atmosphere in South Africa itself, this multi-national country, that will pave the way for a better future. That is why every one of us, instead of wallowing in something as unsavoury as the Information affair and involving innocent people, should stand together and show a better spirit in this country. Time, circumstances, possibilities and our potential demand that of us. Sir, the results of the by-elections at Swellendam and elsewhere will prove that the people of South Africa want such a spirit.</p>

<p>Mr. President it is very obvious to me that the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat and who dragged the name of the editor of <i>To The Point</i> into this debate is very sensitive about the recent information we have had about <i>To The Point.</i> [Interjections.] I leave it at that, Sir, and I do not want any interruptions from the hon. ex-editor of the <i>Vader-land.</i> I will deal further with him at a later stage. [Interjections.] An hon. Senator says &#x201C;gee my the rede&#x201D;. It needs no imagination to see that that hon. Senator is very sensitive about the situation. I shall leave it to the padres on the other side to deal with that matter.</p>
<p>I think the hon. Senator should be careful, Sir, because people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. He threw a stone at my friend, the hon. Senator Swanepoel, about the few businessmen whom he knows. But his own NP organ here in the Cape, <i>Die Burger</i>, referred to that hon. gentleman after his famous speech when the Police Bill was discussed and when he said something very nice about the police. It reminded him that he was not the editor of all the newspapers in the country and that he had been the editor of only a minor newspaper in the past.</p>
<p>That hon. Senator talked about character assassination but what did he do here this afternoon? Why did he hammer on the personality of the hon. Senator Crook. Is that not character assassination? [Interjections.] I am told that the hon. Senator asked for it, Sir! I want to put what they say to the test. I will be pleased if the bench-mate of the hon. Senator Van Schoor would confirm that he has also sat on a Select Committee of this House. He need only nod his head. The fact that he does not reply and remains immobile means that he agrees. The hon. Senator served umpteen times on Select Committees asked for by that side of the House in an attempt to muzzle the hon. Senator Crook. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister of Finance will give me his opinion on this. I refer to a statement the hon. Senator made in this very House in March of this year. Did the hon. Senator not say that select committees consisted of two groups of people, one group appointed by the Government and the other group appointed by the Opposition, and that every time that happened there was no real conclusion? The hon. Senator also said in this House: &#x201C;This is an exercise in futility.&#x201D; Yet hon. Senators opposite use the findings of that Select Committee to try to assassinate the character of the hon. Senator Crook. That hon. gentleman was a member of that select committee.

For the information of the hon. Senator Van Zijl the reference is column 509 of Tuesday, 6 March of this year. There he will see exactly what he said. He said a select committee was in fact &#x201C;an exercise in futility&#x201D;. However, hon.

<p>I want first of all to say something nice to the hon. the Minister of Finance. That may assist in calming him down a bit I wish to express my appreciation for the fact that he did let me have a copy of his budget speech. I am pleased to know that he has behaved so correctly and courteously towards an Independent At the same time I want to apologize for not having been present in this Chamber on Thursday when he delivered his budget speech. I was not away like most hon. Senators who were fighting by-elections. I was attending to matters in my constituency to which I will refer later in my speech.</p>

<p>Among other things he said: <i>&#x201C;The Citizen</i> het niks gedoen aan die uitslae van die verkiesing in 1977 nie.&#x201D; What double talk, Sir! Hon. Senators opposite have paid tribute in this House to the Erasmus Commission. Let me quote what the Erasmus Commission says in its report I quote from page 60, paragraph 9.263&#x2014;</p>

I hope that &#x201C;the heilige Koot&#x201D; will agree that the UP did more during those years to bridge the gap between Afrikaans-and English-speaking people than that side could ever hope to do. They are possibly now reaping the benefit of all those years. [Interjections.] Let me tell the hon. Senator Van Staden that in those days when we were building the bridges between the English-and Afrikaans-speaking people and creating a united nation, they were intent on causing division.

I want to ask him: &#x201C;Did he go to Dr. Connie Mulder and ask him to make an attack on me or did Dr. Mulder go to him and asked him to make an attack on me?&#x201D; Senator Horwood said there was talk about this album of photographs which Dr. Rhoodie had. The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> had published certain of these photographs.</block>
<p>The hon. the Minister is then quoted as having said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">I want to ask the editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>: Does he have the album of Dr. Rhoodie&#x2019;s pictures, did he buy them from Dr. Rhoodie and, if so, how much did he pay for them?&#x201D; Senator Horwood said that if the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> had such pictures, he wished to ask the newspaper to publish them. Mr. Sparks should say how he got the pictures.</block>
<p>Sir, I do not think this is a very nice thing for a responsible Minister to have said. I am, however, mentioning this matter in order to give the hon. the Minister a chance to reply.</p>
<p><i>The Cape Times</i> of Wednesday, 9 May, has the following to say, and I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Editor&#x2019;s reply to album challenge.<br/>The editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, Mr. Allister Sparks, yesterday issued the following statement in reply to a challenge issued in the House of Assembly on Monday by Senator Horwood. &#x201C;Senator Horwood has implied that we are in possession of these pictures of Dr. Connie Mulder and that we have used these to blackmail Dr. Mulder into attacking Senator Horwood. The insinuation is devoid of any shred of truth. I do not know whether any such pictures exist The Rand Daily Mail certainly does not have any in its possession, nor have we ever seen or heard of any. And even if we were ever to find ourselves in possession of any such material relating to anyone at all, we would never dream of using it in the way Senator Horwood insinuates. It must be a matter for the gravest concern that a Cabinet Minister who holds a position of high public responsibility should make such a damaging insinuation without any basis in fact whatsoever.&#x201D;</block>
<p>This is a very, very serious allegation by a newspaper. I think the hon. the Minister should do something about it. I quote further&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x201C;If Senator Horwood had any facts at all to back his statement, it would be his duty to take them to the nearest attorney-general to institute a prosecution. But, of course, Senator Horwood will not do this because he cannot.&#x201D;</block>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Thank you, Mr. President According to the latest annual report of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing the farmers&#x2019; debts amounted to R2 660 million at the beginning of 1978, compared to R2 311 the previous year; that is an increase of R349 million within a period of one year and I am sure that this amount has increased further since then.</p>
<p>If we look at the statistics, we must realize that the farming sector as such has had good seasons for the past few years. We have a drought at present, and I think the lean years lie ahead. I think it is cyclical. But if the farmer found it so difficult to build up capital in the good years and had to incur further loans, one realizes what the position is going to be in the years ahead, Sir. What is more, the percentage of debt against capital invested in farming increased from 12,2% to 13% in one year, and that is really disturbing.</p>
<p>The agricultural industry is experiencing difficult times now and it is disturbing. Producer prices will have to be raised and the consumers will have to carry the burden.</p>

<p>Yes, I shall come to maize. I want to make it clear that the consumer public will have to pay higher prices. We farmers are not a charitable institution and I think it was always the policy of the old UP that when the costs of food production rose to the extent that the lower income groups could no longer afford essential foodstuffs, the central Government had to subsidize the consumer, that is, from the Treasury.</p>

Senator from Zulu Farm must listen carefully&#x2014;the net producer price of maize rose by only 29%, while in the same period tractor prices&#x2014;and, Sir, you know that unlike the Zulus we cannot produce maize without tractors, we must have tractors&#x2014;increased by 83% and the price of farming equipment by 79%.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I find this typical when price increases occur. Over the years we have had record maize crops. In 1973-&#x2019;74 we had a record maize crop of 10 610 million tons and even last year we harvested 9 806 million tons, but this year the crop will not even be 7 000 million tons. In other words, many of the farmers will not be a single cent better off as a result of the increased maize price. They will have no crop.</p>

<p>Yes, he is a retired farmer, but other people have to cope with the problem. Sir, the drought is very serious, and I want to refer specifically to my region, the Marico district We live on the border and we guard the border to keep the people behind the Liesbeek safe. Representations were made to the magistrate to have that region declared a drought-stricken area. One does not easily resort to this, but the situation is very serious. I want to read a few quotations from the memorandum which was originally drawn up in support of these representations. We show that in April 1978 we had 33 mm rain; in May, June, July and August, no rain; in September, 25 mm; October, 20 mm; November, 35 mm; December 35 mm; January, 21 mm; February, 57 mm; March, 23 mm and April none. That is a total of 248 mm, while the average rainfall there is over 500 mm. There is nothing the farmer can do about this situation. Tins is also typical of many other areas.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Let me tell the hon. the Minister of Finance in a serious vein that at the moment the position is, that drought relief can be given to the farmers in two ways. The first is a rebate on rail tariffs for the transport of stock feed and animals. The position today is such that even in the Free State where the hon. Senator Groene-wald comes from, one cannot buy fodder. It is no use giving a rebate on the transport of fodder. The only fodder that one can probably buy is yellow maize and at a price which our farmers also have to pay because their fellow-farmers got an increase in price.</p>
<p>The second sort of aid which can be given is in the form of loans to the farmer at a low or subsidized interest rate, which he will start repaying after five years, to buy feed and licks. I think it will only take the farmer from the frying pan into the fire if additional credit is extended which he will eventually have to repay. I hope that the hon. the Minister and the Jacobs Committee that has been appointed will look at the farmers&#x2019; plight and give some attention to this matter. I really think it is no use extending further credit to the farmers who are already deep in debt, not through any fault of their own but through circumstances. I hope some way will be found to make the help which they are given under these circumstances more effective.</p>
<p>Then we come to the dairy industry, and I must say that this is something which surprises me. I am not only a red meat farmer but I also produce industrial milk. I produce industrial milk, unlike the hon. Senator who gets lovely fat prices for his fresh milk. In this hon. House the then Minister of Health stood up an recommended that the margarine industry should be allowed to colour margarine yellow. The Minister of Agriculture sat there and did not say a word. Now we find that the present Minister of Agriculture&#x2014;and he is a glib fellow; I see he simply gets on his motor-cycle and rides to Darling when he has big worries&#x2014;says that he might withdraw yellow margarine. But, Sir, that would be ludicrous. The harm has been done. If he were to take yellow margarine off the market now he would be doing the lower bracket wage earners an injustice. There just is no butter today to take the place of margarine, and this has come about because of Government policy.</p>
<p>I do not want to plead the cause of the margarine industry but now those people are being accused of making false propaganda as to the value of margarine. But, Sir, they were assisted by the then Minister of Health. He said that margarine was healthier than butter but now we have no butter supplies in the country and it would be a great injustice to withdraw yellow margarine at this stage. I think the hon. the Minister would be stupid if he did that, and his statements will not benefit the agricultural industry because once again it will be said that the farmers of South Africa are spoon-fed by the Government, as the hon. consumers on the other side usually say. I hope I have made my point here. It seems to me that the hon. the Minister is worried but he probably did not hear me ask for the second hour.</p>

<speech by="#jager">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">D. F. DE JAGER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I am not going to speak on the Information debacle today. I just want to remind the House of what the hon. Senator Dippenaar said the other day in connection with Swellendam. If the NRP took a proper look at the results at Swellendam and those at Beaufort West, they would be ashamed of themselves for having taken up the time of this House, not just by trying to get at the Minister but by asking the Minister to resign so that an election can be held. I just want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that if that is an indication of how the public are going to vote, I advise them never to go to the country because look what happened in spite of everything that was in their favour to get the public on their side. The fact of the matter is that the NP is not a party of persons; it is a party of principles. We are a national movement. If we are cross about something, we talk about it. We sometimes talk about one another which we should not do, but when the day comes for us to vote, we know whom to vote for. We vote for South Africa; we do not vote for a person. That is the difference, Mr. President.</p>
<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance that we have the greatest respect for him. In 1972 he said in this House that he saw the day coming&#x2014;he said before the &#x2019;eighties&#x2014;when the price of gold would rise to $80. What did hon. Senators of the Opposition say? Today they have to recant My advice to them is that they recant what they have had to say about the Information affair.</p>
<p>We must look at what South Africa means to us. If we look at the main budget, the Railway budget and the Post Office budget as well, the three independent budgets, and when we see that about R17 billion is spent in South Africa, then it is a scandal for this Opposition to complain about a few million rand. I want to say immediately that I do not like it You do not like it, Sir, nobody likes it. But they have now set a massive witchhunt in motion against the hon. the Minister of Finance. He did not spend that money. It was another Minister who neglected to see that that work was done properly.</p>
<p>I just want to tell the Opposition that at the next election we shall deal with them in the same way as they were dealt with by Beaufort West and Swellendam.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I want now to come to my part of the world. I want to thank the State for the powerful Air Force base that has been established at Hoedspruit for the protection of our eastern border, as well as the army base that is being built at Phalaborwa and the delicate equipment at Mariepskop. This has all been done to safeguard our eastern border.</p>
<p>I want to refer at once to Foscor which is a semi-State institution at Phalaborwa. Foscor has been run economically for a number of years. Each year it pays dividends to the IDC; it pays tax to the State and provides job opportunities for a very large number of White as well as Black workers. Foscor has also made a very big contribution to the economy of the country. In this connection I want to refer particularly to the production costs of Foscor in contrast to the cost increases in related industries and particularly to the unprecedented increases in the prices of fertilizer. Foscor has neutralized its cost increases through increased productivity per labour unit and in this way it was also able to make its contribution to the farming community to enable it to produce food at a low price. For the past few years Foscor has been able to show a net profit of approximately R9 million. But if we look at price increases in the private sector in connection with the manufacture of fertilizers, we have no option but to throw our hands in the air and ask: &#x201C;Where will it all end?&#x201D;</p>
<p>There is another problem which is rearing its head and that is the possibly monopolistic circumstances which can develop in this sensitive industry. According to information, AECI already owns 49% of Triomf and, according to reports in financial periodicals, the position is as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Though Luyt insists he will be in control of Triomf in 25 years, one of the most persistent items of market talk is that he would like out One stockbroker&#x2019;s newsletter reported that Luyt was keen to sell to Federate Volksbeleggings. Other sources maintain that the take-over is by Luyt&#x2019;s 49% partner in Triomf, AECI.</block>
<p>If AECI does not take over directly, they can quite easily do it through one of their international subsidiaries. They could then even make use of security rands to get possession of it at a cheap price. Monopolies have never catered for the interests of the consumer. I want to ask the State to keep an eye on this position. Indirect control can, of course, be obtained by AECI, as I have already mentioned. While I am speaking of Foscor, I want to refer to another company, namely PMC, Phalaborwa Mining Company. This company operates the largest open-cast copper mine in the southern hemisphere. PMC showed an astounding profit of R36 million in 1977, after R13 million had been written off, and R43 million in 1978 after R14 million had been written off. In 1977 its tax amounted to R14,6 million and in 1978 it was R19 million. I want to refer to these two large undertakings which have contributed towards the sound development of the whole eastern portion of the Letaba district and towards providing job opportunities for the population.</p>
<p>I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister of Finance this afternoon. Years ago, in 1964 and 1965, a determined effort was made to establish sugar in the Lowveld. I have mentioned this before when the Hon. the Minister of Agriculture was here. I am also aware of the fact that this matter actually falls under the Minister of Economic Affairs. The former Minister of Finance, the late Dr. Diederichs, was then Minister of Economic Affairs, and he issued a provisional permit on 19 June 1965. The hon. the Minister of Finance need not use money accruing to the Treasury from outside this district. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he will not use his good offices to get the PMC and the State to the stage where they will establish a sugar industry in the Lowveld. This will have tremendous advantages, Sir. Foscor and PMC have thousands of Black people living in good three-bedroomed houses in their environs and also at Phalaborwa. There are thousands of other Black people living in the Black areas who have no fixed income. The land is there and water can be laid on. If we could get the farmers who are going through such difficult times at the moment to plant sugar, the Black farmers too, we would have an established farming community, Black and White, there, which could serve as a strong buffer against the influence of Frelimo just the other side of the border. They all speak Tsonga and they are all Shangaans. If we could establish those people as farmers and they all had somewhere to live they would not be so ready to listen to the people on the other side of the boarder. We have continually to send back thousands of these people because there are no job opportunities for them. We must also not forget that those people have a psychological influence on the people on our side. They are governed by a Black government and the people on this side are governed by a White government, and they are ripe for indoctrination.</p>
<p>When I speak of sugar, my intention is not so much to ask that sugar mills be constructed. The position in Brazil at present is that they do not have the coal to produce ethanol. The have decided to use sugar and maize to produce ethanol.</p>
<p>I think it is important that Sentrachem are going to invest R350 million in a project of this nature. If Sentrachem can develop such a project, then I think the State can do so as well in order to act as a stabilizing factor in the Lowveld. I do not think things are really so bad for the sugar farmers. If one looks at the financial statements of Tongaat and Huletts, one sees that they made a very good profit in 1977. They need not be ashamed of the profits they have made. But what seems stupid to me and the consumer public is that they use magic figures to try to get an increase in the price of their products. And they are granted.</p>

<p>Mr. President, as I say, such a sugar industry would create new job opportunities for both Black and White people. If an ethanol industry can be established, those hundreds of tankers which run from Sasol to Phalaborwa could load ethanol in that same area for mixing at the Sasol complex.</p>
<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider something in regard to diamonds. I want to refer to an article which appeard on 14 March in <i>The Argus</i> in which it was said that the Israeli diamond industry has shown tremendous expansion. The production today is 200 times greater than it was in 1948. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if it is not possible to increase the size of the diamond-cutting industry in this country. We need only look at the financial statements of De Beers and at the reports of its marketing organizations. Most of the diamonds are exported to London, from where they are sent back to South Africa. London is the central sales organisation&#x2019;s main depot. In terms of the Government&#x2019;s attitude at present that we should first look to our own interests, this industry could provide us with a considerable amount of revenue.</p>
<p>Another question I want to put to the hon. the Minister is whether the State is also obtaining its rightful share revenue from the sale of those diamonds which are sold in Europe at the increased premium of 40% which the selling organization imposed on the sale of diamonds last year.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to ask the hon. the Minister if it is not possible for the State to increase its production of diamonds from its diggings so that we could have the benefit of the increased prices which diamonds are fetching on world markets today.</p>
<p>Now I come to Sasol. The Permanent Cabinet Committee and the Energy Policy Committee and Secretariat envisage the fol lowing measures: Preparation of legislation, realistic programme for coal exports; substitution for coal gas by fuel oils as a source of energy for industries in the country&#x2019;s most important industrial areas; the readiness of the authorities to identify and counter any adverse balance in the consumer patterns of petroleum products which cannot be accommodated by the refineries; a comprehensive programme for the strategic storage of petroleum; continued research and development by Sasol in the field of coal gas; the establishment of a national committee for energy research; the development and commercialization of a new uranium enrichment process by Ucor; and the construction by Escom of South Africa&#x2019;s first nuclear power station. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, in view of that terrible accident that nearly happened in America and, as one reads in all the newspapers, the fact that people all over the world are now afraid of the use of uranium and nuclear power stations, whether our Government&#x2014;we are one of the largest producers of uranium&#x2014;should not approach newspapers overseas and place large advertisements in them to show that, in spite of that occurrence South Africa, has the fullest confidence in nuclear power stations and that South Africa will continue with the development of its uranium enrichment process for the benefit of the world. Exceptionally good progress has been made at Sasol II and, because circumstances have so changed, the Government has decided to increase the staff there to 20 000. We are confronted with great problems in connection with unemployment these days, and I want to point out that through the actions of the State, this will indirectly be a major source of job opportunities for these people.</p>
<p>I also want to refer to the training programme being undertaken there. Approximately 650 workers, White, Black and Coloured, are at present being trained in various categories of welding, pipe-laying and pipe installation. But, Mr. President, what is important, is that more than 3 000 have already completed their training.</p>
<p>As a result of the training which the men receive at Sasol I, Sasol II will experience fewer problems in regard to training because they will get trained people to do the work. I should like to refer to the group turnover at Sasol I. Nowhere is the success of Sasol I&#x2019;s traditional striving for productivity better reflected than in the latest financial report of the company. The group turnover was R832 million for the year 1977-&#x2019;78. This was the highest in Sasol&#x2019;s history and is an increase of R140 million over the R692 for the previous year. The profit before tax for the year was R 114,7 million. After tax it was R73,3 million.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I should like to refer again to a speech I made here a few years ago. At the time everyone was clamouring for the abolition of State institutions. This afternoon we have already had proof of Foscor, and here again proof of Sasol, which shows that the State-founded companies are contributing their share to the country&#x2019;s economy. They pay tax to the State and dividends to the IDC which provides them with the necessary funds.</p>
<p>Increases in the prices of many of Sasol&#x2019;s products have undoubtedly contributed to the improvement in the company&#x2019;s financial returns. Sir, you will remember that from the beginning we have said that the economic viability of the Sasol II project will depend largely on the maintenance of a reasonable relationship between the increased capital costs of the installation during the construction period and the prices of petroleum products. In actual fact the international price of petroleum has not risen as quickly as the installation and equipment costs have. I think that in the meantime there has been a slight change in the position because there has been another price adjustment.</p>
<p>Sir, I want now to refer to the productivity of Sasol. To return to the good financial returns of the past few years, I say again that these speak volumes for the dedication shown by the whole Sasol organization in its striving for greater productivity and profitability in all its activities. I should like to mention a few examples of what has been achieved recently. During the past six years the yield and turnover of group products, expressed in tons per employee, increased by 32%. During the past three years the value of production increased by 89%. The total manpower increased by only 8% while the physical production in tons per employee&#x2014;this includes White and non-White&#x2014;rose by 14%. The total manpower of the present production units at Sasolburg was reduced by 8,6% during the past year, while a reduction of 13,8% is envisaged for 1979.</p>
<p>In the factory laboratory a reduction of 7,3% has already been achieved and the aim is 23%.</p>
<p>Sir, I want to refer to the life expectancy of Sasol. At the time of construction they envisaged 100% production. As a result of the new methods our people are now applying, we now have a production of 160% of the original capacity.</p>
<p>I also want to refer to coal consumption. It is interesting to note that last year Sasol used 5,1 million tons of coal for the manufacture of its products. It is pleasing to be able to say that Sasol&#x2019;s new techniques for the processing of coal will be implemented at the new Sasol IL The main contractor at the Sasol II project&#x2014;and for the extensions to that project&#x2014;is an American construction company, and this afternoon I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister that when America negotiates with our country for the use of our processes in America, the State will look first to the interests of South Africa. I read a report recently that America wants to go so far as to expel South African students who want to qualify in energy studies at American universities. I want to say immediately that the same America which gets uranium and all the other minerals from our country has said openly that it will not supply us with enriched uranium for the Koeberg power station. Thanks to the Government&#x2019;s involvement with and the support of the National Institute for Metallurgy, they can go ahead with the South African process and improve it so that we shall shortly be manufacturing our own fuel at Pelindaba.</p>
<p>I want now to refer to the use of South African expertise in the industry. The original industry commenced by using the American Fisher Tropps and German processes. Every-body who knows Sasol will know that the projects sold to us by those two mighty nations were not able to get going for years. It was the expertise of our own people that simplified and improved those processes so that today&#x2014;as I have already said&#x2014;there can be a reduction in the number of technicians whom they have to employ and they have a better process which America would very much like to have. That is why I say that is a giant among the giants. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister of Finance that if a request is received for us to make our knowledge available to them, we take a hard bargaining line. We must say to them: We shall negotiate with you, but we want something in exchange for what we have to offer you.</p>
<p>Mr. President, in the last minute at my disposal I want to refer to the export of coal. The oil companies have entered the field of coal exports. Richards Bay was developed for the export of coal. But what are the oil companies doing? They are going over the heads of the Transvaal Coal Owners&#x2019; Association. They do not want to export their coal through an established and recognized body. They want to go their own way. [Time Expired.]</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Thank you very much. I know very little about the subjects he was discussing, but one of them in particular did interest me, i.e. the question of atomic power stations. A little while ago I read that it had been suggested that an investigation into the erection of such a power station be considered for the Natal coast [Interjections.] I want to say to the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat, who obviously knows more about the subject than I do, that I personally believe that a great deal more research into the safety of these power stations is needed than has been done up to date. I for one am completely unconvinced of the safety measures, in view of the recent accidents overseas, in regard to power stations, their use and their viability in South Africa. I have a horrible suspicion that the experts are tending to dodge the issue, and I hope some day to discuss this particular matter with my hon. friend who has just resumed his seat.</p>
<p>Mr. President in the time available to me at this late stage in the afternoon, I want to begin by saying to the hon. the Minister that there is no question that the Riekert and the Wiehahn Commissions have established a watershed in South Africa politics. In my personal view this is the finest development that has taken place in South Africa since the NP came to power in 1948. I believe it heralds not only a new era but also the complete abandonment of NP policy in the very foreseeable future. I think that the essense of these two reports means that the South African Government at long last has recognized that all the people living in South Africa are citizens of South Africa and that our economy depends on the fair treatment of all these race groups as citizens of the country. I therefore hold nothing back in regard to my gratitude in respect of these two commissions: My only hope is that the Government will act on their recommendations speedily before the aspirations of the people concerned are not raised too high with very little development to follow.</p>
<p>Having said that, Sir, I am sorry that I must once again refer to the Department of Information matter. [Interjections.] I am sorry to have to do so, because there are very many problems facing South Africa. We have problems in regard to South West Africa where we have just had brutal murders committed. [Interjections.] Hon. Senators should just listen for a moment and they might learn something for a change. Something might get through their heads. Mr. President, we have plenty of problems in South Africa. We have problems of inflation. We have been told by hon. Senators on the other side that they are hoping for a growth rate of approximately 4%. But we need a growth rate of more than 5% to provide sufficient jobs for the people in South Africa. Anything under 5% is therefore in fact a crisis situation in regard to the provision of jobs. We have a number of factors that need urgent attention. For instance, we have the cost of living that is running out of control. Praises has been heaped on the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s shoulders by hon. Senators on that side of the House, and that is a natural thing for them to do, but he has still not been able to control the galloping inflation rate and the runaway cost of living that make it harder and harder for people to make ends meet. These, Sir, are the problems we have to face. But we cannot face them because of the very fact that the man who is in charge of South Africa&#x2019;s finances, the man who is in charge of South Africa&#x2019;s money, the public money in South Africa, is losing credibility every day with the people of South Africa. And, Sir, I say it is of his own making because it seems to me that every time he makes a statement, every time he opens his mouth, he puts his foot in it.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the Information scandal is going to go on and on and on because it is fed by the hon. the Minister of Finance. He adds fuel to the flames all the time. It was once said by Gladstone in reply to a member in the House of Commons who asked him whether he should speak: &#x201C;It is better that people wonder why you don&#x2019;t speak than wonder why you do.&#x201D; I often wonder when the hon. the Minister speaks, why he speaks at all, and I am talking about matters of this nature; because every time he opens his mouth he puts his foot right into it.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I want to deal with a couple of things. The hon. the Minister of Finance says, for instance, that he initialled and signed a certain document and he made certain that he did not see what was in that document. Mr. President, have you ever heard of any person in any walk of life signing something of which he has no knowledge? But here we are dealing with a Minister of Finance who signed something but says he covered the items concerned. Yet he happily signed it and then, later on, he happily cancelled his signature on a document that he knew nothing about! This is the Minister of Finance! What sort of Minister of Finance is he?</p>

<p>He is the man whom we trust to control our money. Then, to cap it all, he attacks a former Minister, Dr. Connie Mulder, and he talks about compromising photographs that were handed to the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>He said in so many words that the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> was blackmailing ex-Minister Connie Mulder. If he believes that, he should have gone to the nearest police station or to the Attorney-General to lay a charge. He failed in his duty by not doing so. That is another aspect of the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s conduct.</p>
<p>I would also like to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance, in fact, I would like to ask any Minister in the Cabinet&#x2014;and we have another Minister present in the House at the moment&#x2014;how many of them were aware that when the three newspapers were charged by the Press Council with publishing false reports in regard to <i>To The Point</i>, this in fact was a miscarriage of justice? And having known that it was a miscarriage of justice, what did they do about it? Mr. President, I do not know how many of these Ministers were aware of the fact that a miscarriage of justice had taken place in regard to this matter, but it is certain that the former Prime Minister knew and nothing was done about it. This, I believe, is one of the most serious things that happened in this whole sorry story in regard to the Department of Information.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister of Finance says that his hands are clean, and I do not believe that anybody on this side here or in the Other Place has suggested that the hon. the Minister benefited personally by what took place in the Department of Information. Sir, his hands may be clean, he may not have benefited personally but every shred of evidence that has emerged in regard to this matter, this very sorry matter in South African politics, has clearly indicated that he is the most incompetent Minister of Finance that this country has ever had.</p>
<p>This must be so because the whole record of the Erasmus Commission, regardless of what it tries to say, in fact leaves the impression that we have a Minister of Finance totally incompetent to carry out his duties. This, I believe, is the worst thing that has emerged from this whole scandal of the Department of Information. That is why I say the hon. the Minister of Finance is not only South Africa&#x2019;s worst enemy; while he continues in this office no member of the South African public can have any confidence in this Government.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am not going to give the hon. Senator my opinion as to who was the best, but I know who is the worst. I know who is the most incompetent. Can the hon. Chief Whip on the other side tell me if any of the previous Ministers of Finance would have closed his eyes or turned the page in such a way that he was able to sign a document giving away millions of rands of public money without seeing what he was signing for? Would he then have cancelled his signature also unseen? Can he tell me of any Minister of Finance who would have done that? Can any hon. Senator on the other side say that any previous Minister of Finance, knowing that there was something wrong in the handling of money for the Department of Information, knowing that he had objected to the way it was being handled, would not have had the courage to resign from his office.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>And he did not know about it? The hon. Senator should not make himself out to be more silly than he is. I am asking what Minister of Finance deliberately closed his eyes when he knew that there was something wrong in a department? Whether his hands are clean or not&#x2014;and I will accept that they are&#x2014;I repeat that he is the most incompetent Minister of Finance we have had in our history. As such the public of South Africa are entitled to wonder whether we can have any confidence in such a Minister of Finance. But when he attacks the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> I believe he is going much too far. He virtually accuses the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of blackmail and he accuses Dr. Mulder of things that did not happen. Both of them have denied it. The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> says there is not a shred of truth in what he has said and it will be very interesting to see if the Minister of Finance is going to take any action against the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i> It is going to be very interesting to see if he is going to take any action against Dr. Connie Mulder, because his integrity is at stake now in this issue. Should he fail to take action it will seriously damage his own honour. The hon. the Minister of Finance is duty bound to take some action against the newspaper and Dr. Connie Mulder. No previous Minister of Finance has ever been accused of saying something which is completely untrue. No previous Minister of Finance has ever been treated or slighted in this manner.</p>
<p>So, Sir, I say we cannot continue with a Minister of Finance whose credibility and competence has been completely and utterly destroyed by what has emerged so far. There are questions which remain, questions which are continually going to be asked. Every day new answers come out, but they are not coming from the public; they are emerging from the Government side. It is its own worst enemy. That is why this whole Information scandal is going to go on, and on and on. It is bedevilling the progress and the future of South Africa. It is about time we got finished with it. But, Mr. President, we are not going to get finished with it, because, as I said just now, every time the Minister of Finance opens his mouth, he puts his foot well and truly in it.</p>
<p>I would like to see the end of this whole affair. I would like to see it come to an end. But it is not going to because when the Government relies, as it says it does, on the reports of the Erasmus Commission, I want to say that in my own view&#x2014;and I believe it is a view which is echoed by most of the people in South Africa&#x2014;the Erasmus Commission&#x2019;s credibility is also being destroyed. [Interjections.] Gen. Van den Bergh called it a farce. They did nothing about it, so it must be a farce. I certainly have seen no evidence of the Erasmus Commission. I do not give tuppence for its opinion until I see some evidence. I might then change my mind, Sir, but at the moment we have been told that we must wait until 31 May for the final report of the Erasmus Commission. Mr. President, I am not waiting for it. I do not think it will tell us anything new. The only thing it may leave with us is the everlasting thought that this whole episode, the Erasmus Commission included, has just been an attempt and an effort to cover up for the people who were responsible for what happened in this whole sorry chapter.</p>
<p>I do not believe and I do not believe anybody in South Africa believes that Dr. Connie Mulder is solely and completely responsible for what happened in this matter. There are other members of the Cabinet who were involved to a lesser or greater degree. [Interjections.] The Erasmus Commission even makes that point clear, and the one thing which surprises me about hon. Senators opposite&#x2014;in fact it is something which shames me&#x2014;is that they allow a former colleague, a former friend in many instances, to take the rap, to be a scapegoat and they have not got the courage to get up and defend him and say: &#x201C;No, this is too much, I am not going to allow that to happen.&#x201D; They have abandoned their friend; their sense of loyalty does not exist. This is what I believe Dr. Connie Mulder has every right to feel sore about He has every right to feel badly treated when hon. Senators on that side of the House&#x2014;and there are many sitting in this Chamber&#x2014;who were his close friends and who know that things went wrong, have not got the courage to get up and say: &#x201C;We cannot see you being treated as a scapegoat and taking the rap entirely for matters for which you were only partly responsible.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. President, I do not mind silly interjections; in fact they help me to fill in time.</p>
<p>Let me tell that hon. Senator how this whole episode of Mr. Eglin came about. It was because of a statement made by the most undiplomatic diplomat we have ever had in South Africa, Pik Botha. [Interjections.] Yes. He has not produced one ounce of evidence and he cannot produce one ounce of evidence. He gets up and makes a statement, and that statement concerns something he was aware of over a month previously, and it is something he was told about. It is all so much eyewash, a storm in a teacup and an attempt by the Government to draw a big red herring across the path in respect of the whole Information affair. It will not wash. If Mr. Eglin wants to travel around Africa seeing leaders, if he wants to &#x2019;phone ambassadors, I say good luck to him. It is time some of the Government members did the same thing.</p>

<p>We are in trouble in South Africa. We have the possibilities of a great future in respect of these last two reports. But can anybody really have confidence in the people who sit in the Government benches? I cannot have that confidence, Mr. President. It was that same Cabinet, Sir, that sent us into Angola illegally. [Interjections.] That same Cabinet, I say, sent us into Angola completely illegally, against our constitution, and our troops were killed. I have no confidence that they will come to the right decisions. And what happens day after day in this Information affair? More and more information is revealed through different sources: so how in heaven&#x2019;s name can anybody have confidence in them? [Interjections.]</p>

They are entitled to it, but what does this great Nationalist Party do when it is under pressure in this Chamber? It outnumbers the Opposition four to one. But because it is frightened to face a debate across the floor of this House it storms out like meek little mice. This great Nationalist Party cannot face nine members of the Opposition! It goes out because it cannot face the truth. Then it stops further debate by moving the suspension of Standing Order NO. 31.

<p>I am not wasting the time of that hon. Senator. He can leave this Chamber any time he likes like he did last week. What is happening in South Africa today&#x2014;no matter what happens at Swellendam and Beaufort West&#x2014;is that when one mentions the names of Cabinet Ministers, the people pass snide remarks; they giggle; they joke. The people have no confidence in the Government of South Africa. In fact, there is no trust in the Government of South Africa. Since a Minister told a lie in the Other Place I question every answer I get from a Cabinet Minister wondering whether I am also being told a lie. [Interjections.] I don&#x2019;t know what that hon. Senator is saying. [Interjections.] Yes, I just brush it aside.</p>
<p>I want to conclude my remarks this afternoon, Sir, by again saying to the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;I do not know what called him away; it will be a happy day when he is called away permanently to take up some other occupation&#x2014;that the public of South Africa are entitled to the right answers from him, unambiguous answers. The public does not believe that it is going to get those answers from any Erasmus Commission but that it will get those answers only from an open court where the hon. the Minister of Finance and others can be subjected to cross-examination. That is what the public demands and until that happens the Information scandal will go on and on and damage South Africa&#x2019;s name and its progress even more. What has to happen in South Africa is that the hon. the Minister of Finance has to subject himself to open debate and cross-examination. That is the only way in which this Information scandal will be checked; the only way in which it will be stopped. When he makes remarks as he did in the Other Place about compromising photographs of Dr. Mulder that are in the hands of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> he is as much as insinuating that the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> has blackmailed Dr. Connie Mulder. Then the hon. the Minister of Finance fails to take any further action in that regard. I believe that he will be failing in his duty as an ordinary citizen of South Africa if he does not act. Protests are not good enough. Saying that he will give evidence before the Erasmus Commission is not good enough. The hon. the Minister of Finance must at this late hour give evidence so that the public can see that justice is seen to be done. Nothing else will suffice; nothing else will restore the confidence of the South African public in this particular Minister of Finance. To talk of vendettas and that sort of thing is absolute nonsense. The hon. the Minister of Finance knows it and every hon. Senator on the Government side knows it as well. So if we want to end this Information scandal&#x2014;not a so-called scandal as one of the hon. Senators on the other side said it was but a real and terrible scandal in our South African political history&#x2014;the easiest way to do so is for the hon. the Minister of Finance to get up and to say that he resigns. That is the way to end it quickly. If he does not want to do it that way, if he still believes that he has acted correctly at all times then I say he must subject himself to open cross-examination so that justice can be seen to be done. If he does not do that, Sir, then I and all the people in South Africa will be entitled to say that although we have a Minister of Finance who is honest, who personally gained nothing from what took place which led to the Information scandal, we nevertheless have never had a more incompetent Minister of Finance in our history. I hope that we never do. If the hon. the Minister of Finance does not resign he will be lowering the status of our governing system in South Africa. He will be lowering it for all time because he will have established a new norm; he will have established an acceptance of the fact that when a Minister of State finds that things go wrong in his department&#x2014;or does not know that things have gone wrong in his department&#x2014;he does nothing about it but rides it out saying &#x201C;It has nothing to do with me even though I signed documents without making sure what I was signing.&#x201D; If that Minister continues to hold office he will be creating a precedent in South African politics which can do us nothing but harm for all time.</p>

<speech by="#fick">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. J. FICK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat reminded me of a story told to me by a friend. Two Americans in one of the big cities of the United States of America were listening to a soap-box orator who was pleading a certain cause. Having listened to him for a few moments the one asked the other: &#x201C;Jack, what is that guy saying?&#x201D; His friend replied: &#x201C;No, John he ain&#x2019;t saying.&#x201D; That is the type of speech we have so often from the hon. Senator Winchester. Many of the aspects raised by him have already been replied to. I may return to that during the course of my speech.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, Mr. President, the choicest of the tastiest NP dishes have already been served to us during the past two days. There is not much left to be dished up. What is left in the pot I shall personally try to present to the House in the calm manner in which I usually speak.</p>
<p>In order to prevent my prepared speech from being too much of a repetition of what other hon. Senators have already said, I shall have to cut out many of the facts. But in order to retain the logical sequence of my arguments I shall, without going into the reasons why certain subjects have been raised, just refer to them so as to retain the logical flow of what I have to say. In this connection I have the following matters in mind: Mr. President, I agree with previous speakers that the unsavoury attack on the hon. the Minister of Finance is nothing but a futile merry-go-round exercise of an uncomparably dubious standard. One cannot get away from that, Sir. Furthermore, it is a charge against the Erasmus Commission in whose impartiality hon. Senators opposite have no confidence, while those same people refuse to testify under oath before that commission. Nobody has ever prevented them from doing so. Now they give the impression that they have to be asked to testify, &#x2026;</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#moll">

<p>They have been threatened.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#fick">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. J. FICK</person>:</from>
<p>&#x2026; that they have to be begged to testify. If they are in fact so seriously and deeply concerned about the state of affairs in South Africa that the commission is investigating, one would have thought that their patriotism would have compelled them to inform the commission of the things they merely hint at in this House&#x2014; and prove them to be true by giving evidence. Why do they not do that? We have not as yet had a reply to that question. The next question one asks oneself is why these hon. friends do not wait until the Erasmus Commission has brought out its final report. In view of these facts can they blame speakers on this side of the House for coming to the conclusion that the sustained attacks on the person of the hon. Senator Horwood flow from a desire they have nurtured to denounce him as a dishonourable weakling because of a personal political step taken by him? The hon. Senator Winchester alleged a few moments ago that the hon. the Minister had lost credibility in the eyes of the people, that he should resign and so forth. Reference has been made to the speech made in Johannesburg by one of the greatest men South Africa has ever produced, namely, Dr. Anton Rupert. My hon. friend will forgive me if, in reply to what the hon. Senator Winchester said yesterday, I just add something that Dr. Rupert said but which my hon. friend did not quote. Dr. Rupert said that the hon. Senator Owen Horwood had become the target of personal attacks by the logical successors of Cecil John Rhodes and those who want to gain control of South Africa by financing &#x201C;political parties and newspapers&#x201D;. Those were the words he omitted.</p>
<p>That surprising speech by Dr. Rupert reflects, according to <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i> &#x201C;the general support that he received there from more than 600 of the delegates&#x201D;. Strong disapproval was expressed at that meeting of the attempt to implicate the hon. the Minister of Finance in this Information debacle and to present him in a dishonourable light. The congress and leading businessmen from all over the country loudly acclaimed Dr. Rupert&#x2019;s motion of appreciation and it was unanimously adopted. That is a completely different picture from the one a person would form if he did not know the hon. Senator Winchester. I should like to read something else that Dr. Rupert said. He said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Ek het spesiaal hulde betoon teenoor die Minister van Finansies, Senator Horwood, omdat hy deur sy begroting getoon het dat hy die besondere belang van private inisiatief erken het. Hy het die land deur &#x2019;n diep drif gedra.</block>
<p>He also made other remarks that have already been quoted here. He pointed out that the people who were behaving in that manner towards the hon. Senator Horwood, were the logical successors of those who took the diamond fields of the Free State, those who wanted to annex the Transvaal because of its gold and those who wanted to govern our country by financing political parties and newspapers. He could very well have added those whom one has in fact to beg to disclose the names of the shareholders, and to tell one who the people are who have most say, those faceless people behind some of the English-language newspapers. He said further&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Hulle mag ook teen my vergelding soek, maar ek het meer waardering vir lojaliteit as vir geld. Daar is reeds tekens dat hulle dit teen die Afrikaner &#x201C;establishment&#x201D; soek.</block>
<p>That was what Dr. Anton Rupert said. I agree because that is quite clear. If there is this antipathy towards a Minister, an English-speaking South African, for having joined the National Party, the only reason must be that he has sided with the Afrikaner &#x201C;establishment&#x201D;. However, I do not want to quarrel about that any further but one has to react to what the previous speaker has said.</p>
<p>A great fuss has been made of the incident last Thursday when the Government members in the Senate walked out. The Opposition speakers have labelled that walk-out as an NP violation of their democratic rights. The hon. Senator Horak dealt with that at length.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. J. FICK</person>:</from>
<p>No, that is my interpretation. The hon. Senator did not personally use those words. However, I would be violating my conscience if I did not tell hon. Senators that I personally walked out because my whole being cried out in protest against the obviously senseless cacophony of hollow tirade that was once again being directed at a person who had already been declared innocent juridically and that while there were more important and more serious national matters that needed our attention time was being wasted so that attention could be distracted from the weakness of and lack of policy on the part of the Opposition. Sir, let us remember one thing. This is a psychological fact and hon. Senators must not forget it. A certain type of person who is petty, nondescript and who has never achieved anything, will sometimes attack and criticize someone who is bigger and more famous than himself in an attempt to enhance his own personality and to attract public attention. The Opposition must be careful that that psychological judgment is not passed on them. However, there is one bright spot discernible in our differences. It would appear that we agree on and are happy about one incident, namely, that Margaret Thatcher is now the Prime Minister of Great Britain. We are very pleased about that.</p>
<p>I think an additional objective of the budget debate is to try to obtain a political profile of the actions and the principles of the various political parties that are represented in this House. We have been told today that the Information debacle has fallen like manna into the lap of the two declining Opposition parties, something they have been exploiting over the past weeks and months in an attempt to divert the attention of the electorate from their pitiful lack of a political policy that will be acceptable to the general public in a multinational country like South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. President, when one listens to scandal-stories, one is told that the public outside no longer has any time for us. And then the public&#x2019;s voice was heard at Swellendam and Beaufort West! [Interjections.] The National Party had a majority of 3 471 at Beaufort West with a percentage poll of nearly 74%. At Swellendam their majority was 4 001 with a percentage poll of over 81%. Their majority there was over 100% more than on the previous occasion. The climate that was created to bring the NP into disrepute and to reduce it from &#x201C;ever&#x201D; to &#x201C;never&#x201D; as Uncle Niklaas Kriek used to say, had no effect whatsoever. Our position is continuing to improve.</p>

<p>No, it was uncle Niklaas who said that; I am merely echoing him. The Opposition should not try to belittle this result.</p>
<p>Mr. President, that reminds me of the history of the former UP when the Young Turks were making such progress and when a few of them won seats in the Johannesburg municipal elections. Shortly after that the NP suffered a setback at a by-election. Sir, you should have seen them when they arrived here! They looked as pleased as Punch and they told us that the NP was finished. The NP bided its time, it spoke nicely to its members and then there was a by-election at Oudtshoorn. What happened then? The Opposition collapsed completely and left with their tail between their legs. We warned them that that would happen; we warned them that the electorate would realize that the exaggerated actions of the Opposition in that connection were only an attempt to hide the poverty-stricken state of their policy. They did not want to believe that. Now they have seen the writing on the wall; thus it has been proved comprehensively and conclusively. We are not quarrelling with them. An additional objective is to evaluate the political profile of the political parties in this House.</p>
<p>Mr. President, let me put it another way. My friends opposite must admit that, in the past, they have shamefully underestimated the intelligence of the electorate. Now they have done so once again. That was why, like the HNP, they tried in a pamphlet to represent the Information affair to the public as a dreadful spectre that had enveloped the entire Government in its fetid shroud. The Twelve Apostles: One turned traitor and they now give to understand that the eleven who remained faithful were also traitors. At that time it was thought that the principles to which He subscribed would disappear! But the principles of Him of whom I speak still live. One would never want to compare oneself with the Man from Nazareth. But one should remember that age-old lesson in the political situation that has been created by the Information debacle. The sins or the mistake of one do not tarnish all. One should take note, however, of the manner in which action has been taken against the person or persons who are guilty. The way it was done in the past cannot be improved upon and all praise is due to the hon. the Prime Minister when we say that.</p>
<p>Mr. President, it is remarkable&#x2014;once again we have to deal with this&#x2014;how difficult the respective Opposition parties have found it this year to discuss their policies. Surely the man who loves his wife and finds her beautiful is proud of her. He wants other people to notice her. That makes him feel ten feet tall.</p>

<p>Are we not discussing your bits and pieces policy? I am sorry that the hon. PFP Senator is not here today. The Opposition has little to say about its policy as such.</p>
<p>Until recently the same PFP whose candidate lost his deposit at Swellendam, still accepted the system of a qualified franchise and thought that it could be successfully applied in South Africa. And now? What do they think now? They must tell us because there has been a congress in Durban in the meantime. Last year they at least went so far&#x2014;after the NP had long since emphasized it&#x2014;as to admit that this country of ours was in fact made up of many nationalities. But we have as yet not been able to obtain any agreement on policy from them. It was a relief to them when they found something in the Information debacle, by way of boastful speeches, to present to their congress instead of analysing their policy to the very core and finding unanimity in that regard.</p>
<p>I want to address myself in particular to the hon. the Leader of the NRP in this House. The NRP are still denying vociferously that the difference between their policy and that of the PFP is only a matter of degree while the end result of the political thinking of both parties will inevitably lead to a Black majority government, the policies of both of them. It will simply be more gradual in the case of the NRP than in the case of the PFP. If the NRP Senators deny that, we would welcome the reasons for such denial in this House. We shall be pleased. The hon. Senator Horak promised Dr. A. P. Treurnicht in a previous debate that he would let him have a written policy statement. I too would like to have a copy. But remember one thing&#x2014;</p>

<p>but let us have clarity. Tell us what the position is and what the difference is between the NRP and the PFP, if there is any marked difference. [Interjections.] I maintain that the difference is only a question of degree. We would like to have an explanation in this connection.</p>
<p>In September 1976 Sir De Villiers Graaff took the initiative in trying to formulate a broader based effective policy to save the Opposition. Do you remember, Sir? The special steering committee consisting of Messrs. Graaff, Eglin and Gerdener, under the chairmanship of former judge Kowie Marais announced a set of 14 principles. The UP accepted those principles in January 1977; those were not the so-called six principles but the 14 Kowie Marais principles, and today he is a member of the PFP. The six members of Parliament who objected were suspended and they then formed the SAP. Surely they represent the true old UP blood, not so? Or what is the position? The NRP should help us so that we can understand the position. The remaining group &#x2026;</p>

<p>In other words, he dissociated himself from the idea that his party was simply a successor to the old UP. In a subsequent speech in May this year he again said that he subscribed to the 14 principles of Mr. Kowie Marais. What must one believe, Sir? Must one believe what he said on the last occasion or what he said last year? He is the leader of the party, is he not? We do not understand the position.</p>
<p>But, Sir, do the Progs not subscribe to the same principles? Surely that makes them brothers, close brothers of the NRP. That is why I say the difference between the two parties is only a question of degree. What is the difference?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the hon. Senator Winchester is not here at the moment and I wanted to ask him what their latest policy was and whether they had reached unanimity on their policy. Is it the policy of the Schwarz group or that of the Suzman group that is in the lead at the moment, or who&#x2019;s policy? At the same time the hon. Senator Winchester should also tell us why they are opposed to the principle of secret projects in the Department of Information while they are as silent as the grave in regard to Press secrecy in regard to who the owners and shareholders of certain newspapers are. Surely that is illogical, Sir. What is the latest news about the special friendship between their leader, Mr. Don Eglin and Mr. Colin McHenry &#x2026;? Oh, I mean, Mr. Colin Eglin and Mr. Don McHenry? What is the latest news? We don&#x2019;t hear anything. What developments are there in respect of the mutually confidential whispering about a leadership crisis in their party? The newspapers have already been fairly open about that. And when the lightning-conductor, the Information affair, is no longer there, will the deep-seated policy differences once again flare up? Whom does Mr. McHenry recommend at the moment as Leader in the place of Mr. Colin Eglin? We should like to know that. Will we shortly read a newspaper headline, as we did at the time in the case of Sir De Villiers Graaff: &#x201C;Thirteen reasons why Eglin should go?&#x201D; Or, bearing in mind the 14 principles of Kowie Marais, will it be this time: &#x201C;Fourteen reasons why Eglin should go?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Mr. President, the PFP should indulge in some self-analysis and we shall then find that there is a more serious reason for their leadership crisis than dissatisfaction with Mr. Eglin&#x2019;s helplessness and the unpatriotic McHenry telephone episode or debacle. There is a more serious reason, Sir, and that is that their leader personally validates the accusation that the actions of some of his followers cannot be reconciled with true South African patriotism. They cannot! He has become the symbol of that accusation and that is why they demand today that &#x201C;he must go&#x201D;. Mr. President, let me say today that I deprecate the actions of those two people who shot at the flat of Mr. Eglin. I trust that they did not in fact aim at him personally. Apart from the fact that I do not wish him dead on purely humanitarian grounds, I am also pleased that they missed him for a political reason. A live Mr. Eglin as leader of the PFP is the most valuable asset of and best guarantee for its future that the NP and its flourishing future can wish for.</p>

<p>Mr. President I want to conclude on a much more serious note and make the following few serious remarks. I want to ask my friends opposite whether it is not possible for our White political parties to work together towards a more relatively feasible concept of White solidarity in respect of the exceedingly serious and important problems of our fatherland and the interests of its peoples? What I mean is this: In the face of heavy pressure and assaults from so many quarters on South Africa, while admitting that there are certain different political points of view and in spite of them, cannot we at least continue to prove to one another our undisguised loyalty to South Africa and the loyalty of White towards White? Sir, I want to give one example. We can at least display that measure of White unity when we speak or negotiate with Black groups, so that the one political party will not demean the other party, especially the Government, or represent it as being cruel, unfair and so forth, in the eyes of that Black man. We must create the impression in the mind of the Black man that although we differ in our approach and as to the methods to be employed, we as White parties are all honestly seeking their salvation just as we are seeking the salvation of the Whites. We should at least display White solidarity in that circumscribed sense of the word in our attitude towards one another and towards those of a different colour. It is necessary that we do so in the interests of the future of our country; our future demands that. We can and must deliberately aim at and attain that ideal if we are all true patriots and are true to our forebears and our race, because that is not racism, that is nationalism.</p>
<p>In this connection I just want to mention a few aspects in respect of which, I think, it is extremely urgent that we show that unanimity. There is, in the first place, the new Constitution and the negotiations in that regard; secondly, the urgent investigation into the consolidation of the Black states; thirdly, a new phase for the urban Blacks; fourthly, establishing fresh confidence in our economy; fifthly, the physical defence of South Africa; sixthly, loyalty and co-operation in respect of the energy crisis; seventhly, the implementation of the principles contained in the Wiehahn report in the labour field&#x2014;in that regard we have to have unanimity&#x2014;and, eighthly, South Africa&#x2019;s interests in connection with South West Africa and Rhodesia and many other things. What is of the utmost importance, however, is cooperation in implementing the praiseworthy intention of the hon. the Prime Minister, Mr. P. W. Botha, to establish an association or constellation of Southern African states. The role that the West and especially the role that the United States of America is playing in Africa, stresses the absolute necessity of very urgent and determined action in this connection, action in respect of which, I believe, every racial group in our country is entitled to and expects the White political parties to agree and to co-operate. South Africa&#x2019;s salvation does not lie with any of the countries I have mentioned. Our fate is in our own hands, except of course, in the final instance where our fate as Christians lies in the hands of God. But God always works through an interdiary. He uses a person; He wants us to water the seeds of Christianity and civilization that have been sown here. We are of Africa and we should concern ourselves less with what countries like Great Britain and others say. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. President, I do enjoy listening to the language of the hon. Senator Fick It is undoubtedly true that he is well-versed in the Afrikaans language. But if I were so well-versed in the Afrikaans language, I would put it to far better use than he did here today.</p>
<p>I want to reply briefly to what the hon. Senator Fick had to say. He spoke of the incident last week when the hon. Senators on the Government side walked out, and he also referred to the Information debacle. But these are not matters I want to speak on this afternoon, though I should like to point out that the blame for the fact that this debate on the Information question has taken place rests foursquare on the shoulders of the NP. I think the hon. Senator Fick will know the saying: &#x201C;Pity those who are the cause of it&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. President, we have not acted incorrectly; we were not the cause of this thing. And let me say this, Sir. The NP is keeping the flames of the Information scandal burning by making piecemeal disclosures of the secret projects which does no credit to them or South Africa. Whenever a new disclosure is made, we are blamed for talking about it.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator spoke about our policy, but I want to put the following question to him: What did the NP say to the voters of South Africa before the 1977 election? They asked the voters to vote for the new dispensation, the new policy of the NP. And what was this policy, Sir? Was it crystal clear and obvious as the hon. Senator has said? Or was it vague? What did he know about it himself? The public of South Africa were asked to vote for it, but they did not know what they were voting for. Even at this stage nobody in South Africa knows what the real policy is. Now the proposals have been submitted to a select committee. [Interjections.] No, I am speaking of this policy, and it is a very important one. It might be a step in the right direction but there is no clarity in regard to it.</p>
<p>I just want to reply briefly to what the hon. Senator De Jager said here this afternoon &#x2026;</p>

<p>Talk about Swellendam.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#moll">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. C. MOLL</person>:</from>
<p>Let me tell that hon. Senator that there will be other elections we can talk about, but I feel particularly happy about Swellendam. That hon. Senator did not think we would get 2 640 votes. He said beforehand we would not even get 2 000, and now that hon. Senator is not so proud of Swellendam. [Interjections.] Yes, they won, but he is not so proud of it They are trying to make much of it, but it is not true that they are really pleased about the result.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator De Jager said that the NP worked and voted for South Africa. I think if that is his opinion, then it is his opinion, but he must please not arrogate that conviction and that work and the facts he has mentioned. I challenge anybody here to point a finger at this young party of mine, or at me who first belonged to another party, or even at that party, and say that we did not at all times and for many years work and vote for South Africa. None of those people on the other side could ever blame us for that in the past or will ever be able to reproach us for it in the future, viz. that we and our party are not for South Africa.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator De Jager pleaded for the expansion of the sugar industry and, as he put it, for the specific purpose of manufacturing fuel. I want to tell him that before this project is undertaken there must be thorough re search. At the moment there is an overproduction of sugar throughout the world. The price of sugar in other parts of the world is very low. That is one of the reasons why we have to pay so much for sugar here in South Africa. The fact is that sugar farmers in South Africa may not produce their full quota; they may only produce 82% of their quota and the remainder has to remain on the lands. Moreover, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has said that we must not use food to produce energy but that we must use energy to produce food.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Schoor said, <i>inter alia</i>, this afternoon that when the law regarding trade unions is changed, the other races in South Africa will have to show a sense of responsibility. Allow me, Sir, to show here this afternoon how the Black people feel about this. I am going to talk of the specific area I come from. The Black people in the Black towns outside the growth point of Newcastle, e.g. the Black towns of Madadene and Isizweni and the whole complex there, have already shown a great sense of responsibility and that, Sir, before they were told, as the hon. Senator now seeks to tell them, almost threaten them, that if we change the law they must show more responsibility. I want to show the hon. House how very responsible those people have been. An Iscor factory was erected at Newcastle and it has become a growth point. It was erected in implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy of decentralization. As a result many of these Black people have been attracted to the Black towns around Newcastle. It is obvious that where growth points are established, workers will be attracted to them. In the past when housing rentals or bus fares have been increased, there have been unpleasant incidents. There have even been strikes. I remember that a few years ago one of my own vehicles was stoned. The people were particularly upset at the increases.</p>
<p>But this year the housing rentals in these Black towns were raised from R8 and R10 a month to R18 a month. This happened in January this year. In spite of the fact that the housing rentals were increased by 120%, nobody heard a word about it. It did not even appear in the newspapers. The Black people did not kick against it. They showed a sense of responsibility and accepted it. Where there was trouble in the past when bus fares were increased by 10%, this year bus fares in Newcastle were raised by from 29% to 69%, depending on the routes, and the Black people of those towns accepted it. Sir, can you imagine what it means to these people to have to pay these extra fares? These facts together with the fact that there is unemployment at Newcastle and that there is a housing shortage, leads one to the conclusion that these people and their leaders are responsible people. What can it be attributed to? I attribute it to the leaders of these Zulus in that area, the council members of their municipal associations and even the mayor. These people have control over their voters in those residential areas. They exercise control and therefore we, as Whites in South Africa, must be grateful. We should realize that we are dealing here with responsible people. When one thinks about it, one must also realize how free those people are from communist influences, how free they must be from instigators in their midst. Let us take note of the fact that those people are responsible.</p>
<p>A new direction has been taken at the moment in these Black areas round Newcastle; there is co-ordination and those people are taking a definite direction. Having shown how responsibly those people have acted, Sir, I think we should make it easier for them to continue in that way. We must create the opportunities for them to change their way of life, or rather, to improve it, so that they can be proud and happy citizens of this country. If we create these opportunities for them, that will be the best counter to communism in South Africa. If these people are happy and if we can make them happy, not by concessions but by real changes in South Africa, then we can say that we really have contributed something to the welfare of this country.</p>
<p>I think we all admit that it is difficult to put South Africa&#x2019;s case abroad. When we look at the Wiehahn report and at the Riekert report, I must say that we on this side of the House welcome them. This is something South Africa has been waiting for. This is something which will benefit South Africa. When these recommendations are implemented, it will be that much easier to put South Africa&#x2019;s case abroad. Implement these recommendations, do away with job reservation. This will not only be to our benefit overseas but it will also be good for us in South Africa. When it is good for us here in South Africa, then the world outside will not be able to point a finger at us. If all our people in South Africa can be satisfied, then the world outside will realize that things are going well in this country.</p>
<p>For that reason we welcome these recommendations. Dr. Piet Riekert said on television the other evening that if the proposals contained in the two reports could be implemented, it would contribute to a greater extent to the removal of friction among the various race groups. I do not want to be so petty as to say that this is really an admission that friction exists. We do know there is friction. But I do accept that if these recommendations are implemented, they will remove friction.</p>
<p>He also said it would lead to a new era in race relations. It will lead to the inflow of capital from overseas. The important point is that we will make it easier for these people, who in reality are so loyal to South Africa, to remain loyal. The other day the hon. the Minister of Community Development said in the Other Place that he had R760 million available for the construction of houses up to 1982. I am pleased to hear that and we welcome it. But may I say that it is not nearly enough. In the Madadene/Blauwbos complex at the moment there are 23 000 houses. If we accept that an average of 10 people or two families live in each house, this means a population of 230 000 people. At the moment as a result of research which the Zulu Development Corporation has done, it is accepted that at least 250 000 people live in that area. If we want to accommodate 250 000 people, it means that by the year 1982&#x2014;the year the hon. the Minister of Community Development mentioned&#x2014;there will be a shortage of 45 000 houses. If each unit costs R3 000, we will find that it will cost approxi mately R150 million to provide housing for one small group of people at the growth point of Newcastle. For that reason I say that we shall need a lot more money.</p>
<p>The recommendations in the two reports in fact give us the chance of making friends of these people. But we must do more. We must provide job opportunities and housing for them. This must follow on these recommendations.</p>
<p>Sir, there are other suggestions I could make. The Zulu Development Corporation together with the Economic Development Corporation could, for instance, make more money available for businesses. The Zulu Development Corporation can only assist in settling up retail businesses. The time has come when more industries should be channelled to this growth point.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I intend speaking for only a short while this evening and, with your permission, I shall have more to say next Tuesday.</p>
<p>We have of course now come to the end of the debate on the budget motion. I think the debate lasted ten hours. A number of useful, constructive and valuable contributions were made during the course of the debate, for which one is very grateful. These also came from the Opposition side and I shall refer to them again. I just want to say that it is nonetheless regrettable that the atmosphere of this dignified and famous Upper House should once again have been polluted as the result of a few contributions which in my view should really not have been made here.</p>
<p>Mr. President, during the debate on this motion two very important incidents occurred. I refer to the election results at Swellendam and Beaufort West The significance of the election results&#x2014;at Swellendam the NP obtained a majority of 4 000 votes and at Beaufort West almost 3 500 with percentage polls of more than 80% at Swellendam and upwards of 70% at Beaufort West&#x2014;is a highlight in our present political life. Much will still be said about these two results. Even if circumstances had been quite normal and there had not been such an awful witchhunt on the Information affair and so many accusations made against this Government every day, these would still have been outstanding results. What does it mean when one relates it to everything that has been said? There were cries that the Government should resign and hold an election immediately. For how long were we not told that? Since November, every month we have been told that we must go to the country, because then we would see what the voters thought of us. And, Sir, what are these if not elections? What are these if not annihilating results for the Opposition parties? I maintain, and I do not think it can be denied, that as far as the PFP is concerned&#x2014;the hon. Senator Winchester, apparently, while I was holding a discussion, attacked me once again, but that makes no impression on me. However, I am sorry that he is not here because I should like to have spoken to him for a minute or two about this &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, I appreciate the contributions of hon. Senators on the other side of the House, <i>inter alia</i>, those of the hon. Senators Horak, Bozas, Scheepers and Moll. I listened carefully to their speeches and they really made an effort to speak objectively on our economic and financial policy and similar matters. They did in fact make contributions to which one could listen.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers spoke mainly on labour matters. She is undoubtedly most competent and qualified to speak in that field. I listened therefore with great interest to her and I can give her the assurance that we shall give attention to what she had to say. On a later occasion we shall have a lot to say about this because the implications and the results of the Wiehahn and Riekert reports are of great importance to our country and we will have to give them our full attention. I want to thank her for her contribution.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, when I first came to this hon. House we had on the Opposition benches the hon. Senator Norman Eaton, who regrettably is no longer with us. But whenever I had to speak in a debate in which he took part&#x2014;and I happened to check this not so long ago out of interest in some of the older Hansards&#x2014;I invariably found myself congratulating or complimenting him on the way he had conducted his debating. The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers is following in his footsteps. It is not a question of whether we agree with her, or whether we agreed with everything the hon. Senator Eaton said. But, Sir, the hon. Senator Eaton was to me a shining example of a man who put his party&#x2019;s views clearly and courageously. He stood by what he said, he was prepared to listen to the opposite views, and could make a very fair judgement. He also enjoyed the greatest respect in this hon. House.</p>
<p>*Sir, in the minute left to me I want to thank hon. Senators on this side of the House who participated in the debate most heartily for their contributions. It so happens that neither the hon. Senator Crook nor the hon. Senator Webber nor the hon. Senator Winchester, who once again made all sorts of allegations in connection with the Information matter, is in his seat at the moment. I am tempted, therefore, to ignore them. In any event, I think that especially since the hon. Senator Klopper and my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, dealt with them yesterday, they have been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>In accordance with Standing Order No. 22, the House adjourned at <recordedTime time="1979-05-10T18:00:00"/>18h00.</p>

<heading>ALLEGED OMISSION OF WORDS FROM OFFICIAL REPORT OF SENATE DEBATES (HANSARD)</heading>
<p>(Ruling by President)</p>
<speech by="#president">
<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard">PRESIDENT</person>:</from>
<p>Order! With reference to the remarks made by the hon. Senator H. B. Klopper during the course of the debate on Wednesday, 9 May, on the motion for the House to go into Committee on the Estimate of Expenditure, 1979-&#x2019;80, viz. that the words &#x201C;cowardice from the hon. Senator&#x201D; had been omitted from the official Hansard report of the speech made here by the hon. Senator W. M. Crook on 6 March, I wish to make a brief statement.</p>
<p>According to the printed Hansard report the hon. Senator Crook, in replying to an interjection made by the hon. Senator J. M. Slabbert, reacted as follows: &#x201C;I can only expect this sort of cowardice&#x201D; (which was followed by an ellipsis to indicate an incomplete sentence). This sentence was interrupted by a remark addressed by the Deputy President to the hon. Senator Crook, which resulted in what the hon. Senator Crook was saying at that stage being obliterated on the tape recording.</p>
<p>It is therefore apparent from the above that the word &#x201C;cowardice&#x201D; was not, as was alleged by the hon. Senator Klopper, omitted from the printed Hansard report. As far as the alleged omission of the words &#x201C;from that hon. Senator&#x201D; is concerned, I want to point out to hon. Senators that, having personally listened to the tape in question, I am satisfied that these words were not audible and that no words were accordingly omitted from the published Hansard report in this instance. The official report as reproduced in column 506 of Hansard is therefore the correct version according to the tape recording of the relevant portion of that debate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I wish to point out that the hon. Senator Crook tendered his apologies by way of a personal explanation on 7 March (col. 549) and withdrew the word &#x201C;cowardice&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. President, when I commenced my reply to this debate last week, I referred to the wonderful victories the National Party had gained at Beaufort West and Swellendam. I do not want to take that too far or to rub it in too much, but during the course of the debate I made a note of something interesting to which I should like to refer. After the hon. Senator Dippenaar had spoken the hon. Senator Horak said he thought that the hon. Senator Dippenaar should present himself as a museum piece to the Institute for Contemporary History. In view of what has happened at Beaufort West and Swellendam, I think one can say that the hon. Senator Dippenaar made a very modern speech.</p>

<p>I want to have a very serious talk today with the hon. Senator Horak and his colleagues who in fact did try to talk on financial matters and to make constructive contributions. My colleagues on this side of the House did the same. I have a high regard for the calibre of speeches we have had and I shall confine myself mainly to what has been said.</p>
<p>Before I do so, I just want to put a question to the hon. Senator Crook. When did the hon. Senator Crook try to appear before the Erasmus Commission? He said that he had tried to appear before the commission and I just want to know when that was. Was it before the commission announced&#x2014;they often announced it&#x2014;that they would not be hearing any further evidence after 5 May, or was it afterwards?</p>

<p>Why did you not again ask me to go?</p>

<p>The hon. Senator Crook can check on that because I should like to know when it was that he could not appear before the commission. To say that he tried but was unsuccessful, is a remarkable statement to make, Sir. We shall discuss that further at a later stage.</p>
<p>I also want to remind the hon. Senator Swanepoel that he said, <i>inter alia</i>, the following in his speech: &#x201C;I do think, however, that I am in touch with a reasonable number of representative businessmen and I can give the hon. the Minister the assurance that the businessmen in South Africa have lost confidence in the person who acts as Minister of Finance.&#x201D; He said a few other things in the same vein and then he came to certain conclusions. I want to ask the hon. Senator nicely to give us a few names. Who are these businessmen?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>I shall mention their names if the hon. the Minister will tell me to whom he was referring when he said that someone from the Opposition had sent him a note of sympathy in connection with the matter.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I am prepared to submit that name immediately to you, Mr. President. It is merely a question of courtesy. I have the note here and I am prepared to hand it over to you today still, Sir.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, do so.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>However, when someone sends me a personal note I am not in the habit of disclosing the sender&#x2019;s identity without the consent of the person concerned. I am quite prepared, however, to submit it to someone like you, Mr. President. Now I ask the hon. Senator Swanepoel to mention the names of those businessmen.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>I claim the same right as the Minister has claimed, namely to treat the matter as confidential.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>It is no good the hon. Senator saying that. He made a certain statement and I am asking him now just to give me a few of the names. Why do I ask that? Because I am being positively inundated with letters, telephone calls and telegrams from top businessmen in South Africa from all the provinces supporting me. I shall at any time also submit those to an impartial and responsible person. I have a long list of top businessmen and this is not in connection with party politics; it goes beyond the bounds of party politics. The hon. Senator Swanepoel owes it to the House to disclose those names because I am prepared to disclose many of the names in my possession to an authoritative person.</p>
<p>Sir, you will remember that while the hon. Senator Van Schoor was speaking&#x2014;I may be wrong but it was an hon. Senator on this side of the House&#x2014;the hon. Senator Swanepoel, by way of an interjection said: &#x201C;What does Dr. Wassenaar say?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sir, I want to return to more important matters and deal further with the question of gold. In a recent speech I again said what I thought about the gold position, the gold market and the prospects for gold, especially as a monetary asset. It is quite interesting, Sir, to note, that the following appeared in the latest issue of the <i>Mining Journal</i> a few days ago&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Goud het stilweg weer die voorste posisie ingeneem wat internasionale geld-voorrade betref. Teen markpryse is die totale waarde van amptelike goudvoorrade nou groter as dié van die Regering se totale besit van ander internasionale bates.</block>
<p>That appeared in the latest quarterly review of the <i>Mining Journal.</i> It states further&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">As waardedraer is goud weer net so belangrik as voor die middel-sestigerjare.</block>
<p>That is a very significant development and I want the hon. House to take note of that.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as far as gold is concerned, I find it very interesting and important that not only did the American Treasury decide recently to greatly reduce the quantity of gold that they market but the IMF made the same decision and in future they will only sell 440 000 ounces of gold at their monthly sales. I think that is something that we should bear in mind. It shows once again, Sir, that one cannot manipulate the price of gold by the kind of artificial means that the Americans have tried to use in this regard, and I think that is once again further proof of the strength and stability of the gold market. Whatever the Americans have tried in order to bring the price down has only resulted in the price rising, and I think that has probably given them further problems.</p>
<p>†Now, Mr. President, the hon. Senator Horak made some interesting remarks particularly on taxation, but before we come to that. I should like to refer to another point he raised. He also spoke about beer. I am not quite the authority on beer I used to be when I was younger, but the hon. Senator queried the fact that nothing has been done in the budget to decrease the excise duty on beer. He went on to say that the young people of today cannot afford to drink beer, but are being forced to drink spirituous beverages like vodka and similar drinks. I think that is a fair summary of what he said.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Quite right.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I would merely mention that it never was the policy to tax the different types of alcoholic beverages like beer, wine, brandy, vodka and so on according to their alcohol content, and that there is no comparison between the excise duty on beer, wine and spirits. These things have a fairly long historical origin too. Comparable figures for 1977 and 1978 show that the sale of beer increased by just over 5% whereas the sale of spirituous beverages decreased by just over 7% in those two years. According to these figures it would appear that people are in fact drinking less spirits and more beer.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>That is due to my personal contribution.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I cannot make an authoritative comment on the point that the hon. Senator made that young people are tending to drink less beer after exercise and games and are turning more to hard spirits, but the over-all picture is that beer consumption did increase between 1977 and 1978 and that that of spirits generally decreased somewhat. I certainly do not wish to get too involved in an argument with the hon. Senator Horak as far as beer is concerned, so I think I shall leave it at that.</p>
<p>Both the hon. Senator Horak and the hon. Senator Bozas referred to the taxation of divorced persons. Although he did not say so expressly, the hon. Senator Horak appeared to me to infer that alimony should again be made deductible from the income of the person responsible for the payment of it and taxable in the hands of the recipient, while the hon. Senator Bozas, as I understood him, made an appeal for the person paying alimony to his former wife to be taxed at the rate for married persons. The hon. Senator Horak&#x2019;s claim that in proposing the 1962 amendment the then Minister of Finance said that it was his objective to discourage divorce, is not, I think, altogether correct. What the late Dr. Dönges did say was that, and I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It is an incontestable fact that alimony is not an expense incurred in the production of the income of the person by whom it must be paid, but it is an expense of a private and domestic nature.</block>
<p>The inference is that it should not be deductible. This argument as well as the Minister&#x2019;s statement that the deduction of alimony payments for taxation purposes amounted to the State&#x2019;s subsidizing such payments in the higher income categories, in fact, by as much as 50%, I think remains fairly valid.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>That is a typical Dönges argument&#x2014;typical.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>What is more, Sir, the deduction of alimony could tax-wise place the divorcee in a privileged position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the married man earning the same income. If, for instance, they both earn a taxable income of, let us say, R20 000 and there are no dependent children involved, the married man pays tax calculated at the proposed rates for the 1980 tax year, excluding loan levy, amounting to R4 380, while the divorcee paying R5 000 in alimony would pay R3 250 on R15 000 were the alimony to be allowed as a deduction, i.e. R5 000 from R20 000. Even if the tax payable on the alimony by the recipient which will amount to R460 is taken into account, the divorced couple would still pay R670 less in tax. Should the divorced husband have remarried, the position becomes even more anomalous as he would then pay only R2 400, making the tax saving over R1 500. Sir, I do not want to go into too much statistical detail but I thought that was an interesting presentation on the basis of those assumptions.</p>
<p>As far as the hon. Senator Horak&#x2019;s plea is concerned, it must be borne in mind that the present provisions of the Income Tax Act follow the common law principle that a divorced person is unmarried, and are therefore sound in law. The proposed concession to assess a divorced person who wholly or mainly maintains his or her own child or children from his or her own resources for tax at the rates applicable to married persons is not in any way connected with alimony which is paid for the maintenance of a former spouse but is concerned only with the effect which the responsibility towards the children has on the taxpayer&#x2019;s ability to pay the tax.</p>
<p>I thought nevertheless that the hon. Senator Horak did well to raise this point because it is good that we look at these things from time to time. I can assure him that both the Department of Inland Revenue and the Standing Commission on Taxation do that and I appreciate the trouble to which he went to raise interesting points on taxation. Both I myself and the departments concerned would be only too pleased at any time to take these matters further with him if he cares to do so.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Bozas has a disconcerting habit of raising a tremendous number of points in a short speech, but I shall try to reply to at least some of them because he certainly made an effort to be constructive.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Bozas, while welcoming the reduction in the tax rates, expressed the opinion that while the upper limit from which the maximum marginal rate applies had been increased from R28 000 to R30 000&#x2014;he talked about a mere R2 000 increase&#x2014;it should have been increased to R58 000&#x2014;I think that was the figure he mentioned&#x2014;if the inflation rate had been taken into consideration. I do not think the hon. Senator has borne the fact in mind that Government expenditure is also subject to the inroads of inflation. As an accountant of some experience he should be well aware that if you reduce the credits, that is to say, tax receipts, you will have a shortfall in balancing the budget where you cannot inflation-link your expenditure.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, in addition to the fact that income in excess of R30 000 will now be taxed at the reduced rate of 55% instead of 60%&#x2014;I am excluding loan levies; the hon. Senator gets back his loan levies and interest as well; it is quite a good investment &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>&#x2026; taxpayers in the top income brackets also benefit from the reduction of marginal rates in the lower-income categories. This is a very important point. These reductions are carried forward to each succeeding bracket of income so that the top bracket benefits one might say from all the reductions all along the line. For example, in 1979, a married taxpayer with two children, paying the maximum amount of insurance premiums and medical fees, paid R11 200 in tax, again excluding the loan levy, on an income of R32 000. This represented 35% of his income. His tax bill for the 1979-&#x2019;80 tax year will be R9 620 or not quite 29% of income. That is a 6% drop.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>How will you get the other 6% out of him?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>So although the marginal rate on income in excess of R30 000 is 55%, the effective rate&#x2014;and that is what I am getting at&#x2014;in the example quoted will be only about 29% or slightly less. So one can give other examples. That is the order of the improvement we have tried to bring about in the tax scales.</p>
<p>On this point the House might be interested if I quote a few figures. Let us take the position of married persons over 60 and we take the position for the tax year ended February 1979 and the tax year ended February 1980. On a taxable income of R2 000 in 1979 he would have paid R9 and for the present year ending February next no tax at all. He therefore saves 100% if one wants to work it out percentage-wise. On R2 500 he would have paid R54 in the past tax year. This year he pays nothing and this one might say again is also a 100% saving. If one takes R3 000 income, he would have paid R100 and now he pays R35, and there is a 65% saving. If you take R10 000, he would have paid R1 344 and he now pays R957 which is a 29% saving. On R15 000 he would have paid R3 102 and now pays R2 321 which is a 25% saving. I will give two other examples for the sake of interest. On an income of R20 000 he would have paid R5 192 and now he pays R4 389 which is a 15½% saving; on R30 000 he would have paid R11 000 and now he pays just over R10 000, a saving of about 8¼%. Apart from the fact that the savings are pretty substantial, I think we have succeeded in bringing about a position where the biggest percentage improvement&#x2014;if one looks at it from the taxpayer&#x2019;s point of view&#x2014;is in the lower income brackets compared with the higher. That is what we have tried to do very deliberately.</p>
<p>I do not want to bore the House with a lot of figures but allow me to give one or two examples in the case of married persons. I want to quote only three or four figures. A married person with two children and an income of R2 500 would have paid R27 in the tax year ended last February and he now pays nothing. If such a person earns R8 000 he would have paid R796 and he now pays R574, which is a 28% saving. If he earns R12 000, he would have paid R1 883 and he now pays R1 375, a saving of 27%. If he earns R40 000 he will save 8% in the amount of tax paid.</p>
<p>There is an important point in relation to that made by the hon. Senator Horak on the question of the progressive rate of tax, or progressivity. One can say a good deal about progressivity on both sides and I am sure one can criticize it in certain aspects. As far as I know, however, I do not think countries have really succeeded in giving practical expression to the basic principle of the ability to pay without introducing some kind of progressive rate. I think the hon. Senator Horak referred to a flat rate. However, I do not know if I will have sufficient time to go into all the points. There are certainly some problems when one talks about the so-called flat rate of tax and particularly when one looks at the &#x201C;ability to pay&#x201D; principle. There are problems as to how this can be translated into practice.</p>

<p>We can talk on those subjects, Mr. President. It is a very interesting subject. Someone said during the debate that there are only two things that are certain&#x2014; was it not the hon. Senator Horak?&#x2014;i.e. death and taxes. [Interjections.] It is a fascinating subject and taxes will probably be with us for a long time. However, under this Government they will be pretty light.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Bozas also raised other points and I will have to be fairly brief. I cannot deal with all the points raised by him but will nevertheless pass him some notes that I have on some of those points.</p>
<p>While welcoming the increased rebates in respect of estate duty, he expressed the opinion that they were not commensurate with the benefits that had accrued to the Treasury through the ravages of inflation. My reply is that the rebates were not intended to adjust liability for estate duty in accordance with the effects of inflation on the value of property contained in an estate. Taxes are levied to obtain the revenue required for budgetary purposes and as State expenditure is equally affected by inflation, the yield of revenue cannot summarily be decreased to compensate taxpayers for the effects of inflation.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#president">
<from>* <person refersTo="hansard">Mr. PRESIDENT</person>:</from>
<p>Order! I want to ask hon. Senators to converse a little more softly so that we can follow this involved financial discussion properly.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Thank you, Mr. President. I want to end off my reply to that point by saying that the rebates are in fact relief measures which are updated from time to time according to budgetary needs.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator also raised the problem of the valuation for estate duty purposes of properties situated in towns that have been declared as released areas for the purposes of the consolidation of Black areas. While this can be a thorny problem, Sir, it is one which must be resolved individually in each case as it arises, on the facts of each case. Valuations must be made by sworn appraisers who as a rule are experienced persons with considerable knowledge of local conditions and should be able to arrive at equitable valuations.</p>
<p>The final point raised by the hon. Senator Bozas that I can perhaps deal with here is the following. He expressed the opinion that while the average man could afford cover on his life for R80 000&#x2014;this is still in regard to estate duty&#x2014;most of us would not have R40 000 in ready cash to invest in Government securities. While it may be true that very few persons have R40 000 readily available to invest in any kind of investment, it must be borne in mind that there is no obligation upon anybody to do so in a single payment in order to qualify for the exclusion. A testator can do so over his lifetime, in fact. What is more, an amount of R40 000 is sufficient to cover in full the duty payable on the estate of a deceased leaving a surviving spouse and two children with a value of R363 000, including the R40 000, and very few average men leave an estate of that magnitude.</p>
<p>The tax forfeited on an amount of R80 000 can be considerable depending on the total value of the estate, and it is therefore not unreasonable for the State to demand that a testator who wishes to provide for the payment of estate duty in this way should make at least some portion of the money he sets aside in this manner available to the State during his lifetime. I think that would be my general view of that particular matter.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Koch who is not in the House at the moment, in my opinion made a very interesting speech. She argued the case for perhaps a better appreciation of the position of working women under certain conditions. She also mentioned taxation. Perhaps she may find it useful to have a look at the report which the Department of Inland Revenue and the Stand</p>
<p>ing Commission on Tax Policy issued in 1976, I think, at the time of the budget in that year. It was pointed out in that report that it did not simply follow that if we separated the earnings of married women from those of their husbands and taxed them separately, they would gain. There are a number of cases where, in fact, by adding the earnings of both the husband and wife and taxing the total, the couple are in fact better off. It depends on what category one is dealing with. That was a tightly reasoned case that the department raised then in conjunction with the Commission on Tax Policy and they came to the conclusion that, looking at the whole position, one should preserve the <i>status quo.</i> Although from time to time arguments are advanced that we should revise this decision, I must say, Mr. President, that I am not yet persuaded that, taking all the relevant considerations into account, the position of married working women would be improved if we changed the <i>status quo.</i></p>
<p>I think the hon. Senator Koch also raised a number of other matters that were more of a provincial nature. We can certainly try to obtain information in regard to those issues for her.</p>
<p>*I think the hon. Senator Dempsey made a very sensible speech. I think he gave a very clear exposition of our financial position in a few words and I am grateful to him for the trouble he took That is what he usually does when he talks about our economic and financial policy.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Du Toit made a rather strange speech &#x2026;</p>

<p>I shall not talk about its strange aspects. I just want to comment very seriously on one matter that he raised, a matter that is of importance to me as well, and that is the position of the farmer, the agriculturist, and the problems that beset many of our farmers. There is no doubt that problems do exist I just want to give the assurance that the Government is conducting a very thorough investigation into many of these problems. The Jacobs Committee is sitting at the moment and the hon. Senator himself referred to it. It is a very re presentative and authoritative committee. Organized agriculture, co-operative societies and the departments concerned are all represented, as well as financial institutions like the Land Bank and others. We are awaiting their further report that will deal with some of the long-term problems. That is one aspect that we shall have to consider very seriously and as soon as we have that report&#x2014;I expect to have it shortly; I think in a matter of weeks&#x2014;we shall give preference to it and see if we can come forward with a solution. I am grateful to the hon. Senator for having raised the matter. It is very important.</p>
<p>I also want to thank the hon. Senator De Jager for his speech. He asked that the sugar industry in the Lowveld be stimulated. That is also very important. He also asked that the diamond cutting industry should be extended. I can give him the assurance, Sir, that the Government is investigating these matters at the moment. A committee has been appointed to investigate important aspects of the diamond industry and that specific aspect will also be investigated. I shall be happy to discuss the matter further with him in the light of what he has said here.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I do not think I should detain you too long. I have a few further notes here but I think I have said enough to convey my appreciation to those hon. Senators&#x2014;they constitute the majority in this House&#x2014;who have conducted a responsible debate and who have made valuable contributions. That is something one always appreciates. Sir, we do not have the franchise to all wisdom&#x2014;I certainly do not&#x2014;and as far as my departments are concerned, they will investigate all the arguments and suggestions that have been advanced here and if there is anything that may be to the benefit of various interests and in particular to the benefit of the country as a whole, we shall do everything in our power to give effect to it. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity I have had to give this reply.</p>

<heading>POLICE AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading resumed)</p>
<speech by="#schoor">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. M. VAN SCHOOR</person>:</from>
<p>Sir, when the debate was adjourned a few days ago, I was saying that the image presented and propagated partly by the Press, partly by academicians and partly by politicians that the members of our South African Police Force were always walking about with cudgels in order to hit the Press, other bodies and people, was a completely false image. On the contrary, Sir, there are few organizations in South Africa whose co-operation and wholehearted goodwill is as valuable to the Press as is that of the police. Years ago, when I was still connected with a newspaper&#x2014;and I had a major share in it&#x2014;we were in the first to evolve a system of co-operation and understanding with the police and it worked perfectly. The arrangement amounted to this&#x2014;that suitable persons were issued with a certificate signed by the editor of the newspaper and the Commissioner of Police which guaranteed freedom of movement to that pressman at any scene that was newsworthy. At the same time it was laid down in that agreement that pressmen had to approach policemen of certain ranks only for their information. That arrangement worked very well and it was reviewed year after year by way of discussions among editors, news editors and chiefs of police. The problems experienced in the past year were openly discussed at those meetings and agreement arrived at. I do not know whether that system is still in operation today but I take it that it is, because I notice that pressmen still have these certificates. Consequently the suggestion that the police on their part want to place a kind of embargo on the acquisition of news and want to muzzle this much vaunted freedom of the Press, is totally wrong.</p>
<p>I want particularly to reply this afternoon to the challenge the hon. Senator Winchester issued to me as former editor, as a journalist, to justify clause 9 of this Bill.</p>
<p>†I want to explain to the hon. Senator a development which is perhaps not widely known, and is the root cause of this constant conflict between the Press and authority. In this case, authority does not mean only the government of the day; it means authority down to the lowest level of an association of people whose inclination is always to cover up their activities, to close the doors, whereas the essential function of the Press is to open the curtains. There must therefore always be a conflict. This has always been the case, but let us examine the crux of this escalating problem of conflict between the Press and authority. Authority is not just the government of the day; forget about the government It is not this Government alone which must deal with this problem. There are other institutions right across the international spectrum.</p>
<p>The problem arose in the mid-&#x2019;sixties when the International Society of Journalists met at their annual convention in Chicago and changed their code of journalistic ethics. Some hon. Senators may not believe that there is such a thing as an international code of journalistic ethics, but this was the case. Up to the mid-&#x2019;sixties Press freedom was defined by the International Society of Journalists in these terms: The Press, a reporter or a newspaper, is free to publish what it chooses, provided that it first verifies the report at source. This might sound rather restrictive, but it was not There was nothing in that verification obligation which we refer to in journalistic terms as &#x201C;the check-back obligation&#x201D;. It simply meant that particularly in regard to this new-fangled aspect of the Press, this &#x201C;investigative journalism&#x201D; of which we have had so much experience in the past two years, which touched on the integrity and the honour of individuals or institutions, the Press was free to publish anything provided it checked back to the source concerned. Even if the source concerned refused to comment or said that the report was a complete falsification, the Press was not precluded from publishing. The obligation was simply placed upon the Press to refer back to the source.</p>
<p>In the mid-&#x2019;sixties, what happened was this: The International Convention of Journalists meeting in Chicago amended that clause radically to define Press freedom in these terms: That the Press has the right and is free to publish anything if it believes it to be true. That was a tremendous change, Sir&#x2014; the Press free to publish anything merely if it believed it to be true! That intensified the conflict between the Press and authority because from that date onward newspapers regarded themselves free to publish anything they wished. When questioned, their defence was that they believed it to be true. How often in this House has the hon. Senator Winchester not said: &#x201C;I believe, this,&#x201D; &#x201C;I believe that?&#x201D; He may believe it, Sir, but that is no guarantee that what he believes is true. I can refute what he believes to be true and we have frequently done so.</p>
<p>There was a rather sensational sequel to this change in the code of journalistic ethics, Sir. A week after this had been passed in the mid-&#x2019;sixties&#x2014;I think it was in 1966&#x2014;a four-power conference was in progress in Geneva. There was an agonizing struggle between the three Western powers, the USA, France and Great Britain, on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other hand, on the question of disarmament. After three days the conference faced complete failure. In the midst of these intensely difficult negotiations <i>The London Times&#x2014;The London Times</i> of all papers in the world!, the grandmother of journalism which is now in recess due to strike action&#x2014; published a banner headline report on its front page: &#x201C;The British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, has been sacked.&#x201D; Sir, can you imagine a more shocking situation than when the Foreign Secretary of a great power who is embroiled in the most difficult negotiations in the interests not only of his own country but in the interests of the whole free world, is reported in a newspaper as having been sacked by his Prime Minister! It caused a sensation in Great Britain, and when <i>The Times</i> was asked why it had not checked back, why it had not taken the elementary trouble to lift the telephone and &#x2019;phone No. 10 Downing Street to confirm the report with the Foreign Office, the editor blandly replied that they had not regarded it to be necessary because they had believed the report to be true!</p>
<p>We had a similar instance the other day here in South Africa, Sir. You will remember the prize of a few thousand rand being awarded by the Stellenbosch Farmers&#x2019; Winery to Mr. Kit Katzin, a member of the staff of the <i>Sunday Express.</i> It was a prize-winning award for the investigative enterprise and ability displayed by him in the Information affair. Sir, I have no intention whatsoever of denigrating the efficiency or the enterprise of the gentleman who received this award. Even the editor-in-chief of <i>The Washington Post</i>, the newspaper whose two reporters exposed the Watergate affair, was brought out to South Africa, together with his wife, to take part in the accolades of praise that were heaped on this journalist for his enterprise and his ability in this exposé of the Infor mation affair. That was all very well, Sir, but a week later this same Mr. Katzin, after having received his prize, his award, for his investigative ability, published a report in the <i>Sunday Express</i>, under banner headlines, stating that the hon. the Prime Minister had discussed the action of Gen. Van den Bergh in the caucus of the NP. Sir, I sat in that caucus meeting of the NP, as did all of us here, and the name of Gen. Van den Bergh was never mentioned in the caucus. The hon. the Prime Minister, Mr. P. W. Botha, challenged the reporter as well as the newspaper to correct that report. Mr. Katzin and the <i>Sunday Express</i> did so the following Sunday in a very evasive and apologetic type of report. The grounds on which Mr. Katzin said that he had published that report, namely, that the caucus of the NP had discussed the position of Gen. Van den Bergh, were that he had believed his information to be true.</p>
<p>This is the situation in which we find ourselves, Sir. I am not standing here today as an ex-newspaper man to pass judgment on my colleagues, Sir. But I do think that if one acts on such a subjective criterion that one is justified in publishing anything&#x2014;I am not talking about the laws of libel and so forth&#x2014; as long as one believes that what one publishes is true, we have arrived at a very farfetched situation, Sir. I think the Press should reconsider its position very carefully.</p>
<p>In view of the background I have tried to give this afternoon, I think clause 9 is completely justified. After all, clause 9 only prohibits the publication of untrue material. Does the hon. Senator Winchester really want to plead for freedom on the part of newspapers to publish untrue material about the police? Is the hon. Senator prepared to go as far as that? I regret that it has come to this pass that we have to adopt legislation of this kind, but I think we must be very careful and cautious in our judgment of the reasons and the motivation for it.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Van Schoor as a former pressman rather surprised me because I think he argued against himself. He referred to the Press Code, one which I think was well worked out between the Press and the authorities. It has worked very well up to the present time. There is conflict from time to time, there must of necessity be conflict as to what the press regards as being in the public interest and what people would like to suppress. Sometimes a journalist does not get his facts straight but he does not do so with any malicious intent [Interjections.] Well, let us say that there is a maxim in law which I think is a very good one and that is that justice must not only be done but it must be seen to be done.</p>
<p>At this stage I should like to say straight out and without fear of contradiction that by and large we have a wonderful Police Force which is probably among the best in the world. I think the number of policemen who get into trouble because of a deliberate violation of the rules, is very minimal. I think we have a proud record as far as our Police Force is concerned. It is in the public interest that any crime committed by a policeman should be brought to the notice of the public so that the public will know that those policemen who transgress are being dealt with. My experience is that the police have not failed and have not hesitated to take action against a colleague who has transgressed the law. I hope that this will continue to be the case. As a matter of fact, with the reputation of our Police Force, I am sure that will continue to be the case.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am rather concerned about the legislation before us because it may well have the effect of stifling any publication of information concerning a crime by a police-man or a former policeman because of the fear of having to face a court action to clear themselves, the onus being now placed on the accused and not on the State. I think this is the problem. Let me hasten to say that not for one moment do I condone the publication of false information if it is known to be false. Here we have a conflict between what is in the public interest and what is in the interests of the safety of the State. I appreciate the fact that these difficulties exist but I would appeal to the hon. the Minister not to take action that is going to suppress the publication, or not necessarily suppress it but that is going to make it difficult for a journalist to publish information concerning the misdemeanour of a policeman for the reason that the public may well take it that the misdemeanours of the police are being suppressed. And that is something which I am sure nobody in the Police Force or the hon. the Minister would like.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#rensburg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I just want to express a few ideas in connection with clause 9 which is apparently under attack by the Opposition. I should like hon. Senators of the Opposition to consider once again what the underlying requirements are in clause 9. I want to condense them into five points.</p>
<p>The first is that what is published must be an untruth. It can only be established as an untruth after the position has been investigated and after a decision has been reached. As the clause reads at the moment, that onus rests on the person who published it; in other words it places an additional responsibility on the person to make sure of his facts before he publishes his report. Secondly, the clause provides that the publication must have reference to any action by a member of the Force. The English version of the relevant clause reads &#x201C;any action&#x201D; on the part of the Force or a section of the Force. Thirdly, it must refer to the activities of the Force. Fourthly, there is reference to the fact that it is published without there being reasonable grounds for assuming that the statement is true. Fifthly, there is reference to the control that is to be exercised, namely, that the onus is placed on the person who publishes.</p>
<p>No one in this House will deny that the police perform an extremely important task in connection with the maintenance of law and order in our country, as well as in connection with the defence of our country. We know what effect the written word has, Sir. The minute anything is published in this country, it receives wide publicity. It is read all over the world and the subsequent denial in order to correct the position probably never reaches the people who read the initial report.</p>
<p>Another important point is the bad influence this has on a person who does not obey the law. When such a person reads what the police are supposed to have done he will be tempted to contend in court that he was assaulted and ill-treated by the police. I think that the application of these provisions under proper supervision will be of great service to this country.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we have discussed this Bill thoroughly.</p>
<p>I want to start by quoting something from the speech of the hon. Senator Crook which quite impressed me, namely, when he said that this Bill was covering up the misdeeds of the police. He said the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The misdeeds by the black sheep in the police will be covered by this Bill.</block>

<p>The hon. Senator must not talk nonsense. He talks such a lot of nonsense, Sir; he should not talk more nonsense this afternoon. The hon. Senators do not even know what Adv. De Villiers said. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>†It is absolute nonsense and has no relevance to this matter at all.</p>
<p>The point that I want to make, and I think the hon. Senator Crook will grant me that, is that I am quite prepared to accept that there may be black sheep in the police, but I think there must be black sheep in probably every organization in the country.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>So I said.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I ask the hon. Senator to grant me that and if he said that, he has already granted it Thank you very much. That is exactly what I wanted, Mr. President, viz. that the hon. Senator concedes that there must be black sheep in every organization. [Interjections.] It must be so. I am very pleased that the hon. Senator said that because then he will also concede that it may be possible that there are black sheep in the Press. If that is so, then the question is why should they be protected by such a total licence as they have at the moment in respect of the police. This is what I should like to know. Why should they be protected? I am not after the good journalist I said in the Other Place that as far as I am concerned I know of a number of journalists in this country who would not even look at this Bill. They do not have to look at it They would not look at this if this should become an Act. They do their jobs properly, and once they have done it, they write what they see and hear and write what their senses prescribe. However, there are a number of people who write irresponsibly whether it is the truth or not. It is very true what the hon. Senator Van Schoor said, viz. that as long as they believe it is true, they are satisfied. They say: &#x201C;I believe it is true and therefore it is true.&#x201D; This simply cannot be so, especially in our times and especially in respect of the Police who is the bulwark of our democracy. It is not as if it is another department. This is a very important department as far as the public is concerned. I do not want to cover up any of the crimes that policemen may commit. As far as I am concerned the Press is quite entitled to write about the misdeeds of any policeman, as long as it is the truth. They have to do their jobs to the best of their ability to find out whether it is true. They have to try and verify it. That is all this Bill is about. This Bill puts a very light onus indeed on the Press. [Interjections.] The Bill states that&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Any person who publishes an untrue matter &#x2026;</block>
<p>That is the onus that the State has to satisfy and prove beyond reasonable doubt that it is untrue. I quote further&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; in relation to any action by the Force or any part of the Force, or any member of the Force in relation to the performance of his functions as such a member, &#x2026;</block>
<p>Now follows their onus which is a very slight onus&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; without having reasonable grounds &#x2026; for believing that the statement is true, &#x2026;</block>
<p>Without having reasonable grounds. We are not asking them to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement is true. All we are saying here is that they must have reasonable grounds for believing that it is true. I want to go as far as to say that if they gave those reasonable grounds to the police on investigation the police would not even go to the Attorney-General with this matter. The police would not even take this matter any further. They would be satisfied that these people had reasonable grounds. In actual fact this Bill is only aimed at the malicious journalist. It is the malicious journalist we are after.</p>
<p>*Now the hon. Senator asks me: What about Press Council matters? But the function of the Press Council is totally different. The Press Council is an agreement that we have with the Press but not with the people who write for the Press. When I lodge a complaint with the Press Council the journalist does not enter the picture at all. He can still act as irresponsibly as he wants to. It will depend whether or not his immediate chief is annoyed with him. All he need say to his chief is this: &#x201C;I did my best; I was under pressure and what I wrote was not the truth.&#x201D; If his chief does not give him a dressingdown I approach the Press Council and they rectify the matter or a fine is paid which is absolutely meaningless as far as this matter is concerned.</p>
<p>I want to state very clearly that this legislation would not have been introduced in this House today. Many members of the public as well as a section of the Press are our enemies. Already at this stage I can tell those pressmen who do not fall into this category that this legislation would not have been introduced had there not been a reason for it, had it not been necessary for the police year after year to waste their time in trying to correct untruths that had been published in the Press. All we are asking the Press is to see to it that bad journalists are more careful before they write anything.</p>

<p>Can the hon. the Minister give us an example of that?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, I can give you an example, but the hon. Senator wanted me to give him an example of maliciousness. That is quite impossible for me to do so. I am not a court of law. What I can show the hon. Senator, however, is an untruth. I can dispose of the State&#x2019;s onus in a certain matter. I can give the hon. Senators numbers of examples; I have a whole file of them. However, I will refer to the one which, to my mind, has become a hardy annual. It is the one that illustrates exactly what we are talking about. I am referring here to the famous Ncube case. This case was published in <i>The Star</i> of 10 August 1977. The heading of this editorial was as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Two little girls at a bus stop.</block>
<p>However, the editor did not stop at the bus stop; he went one further and wrote a poem in this regard. He wrote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">A pennyweight of love is worth a pound of law. <i>Thomas Fuller.</i></block>
<p>He went on to tell us the following story&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The story of Mr. Brand Ncube, told in <i>The Star</i> yesterday, is horrifying in its implications. Here was a respectable man being visited by his two young daughters from Barberton. He decides to take them to the zoo. While he stands at the bus stop, a police van draws up and arrests several men including Mr. Ncube. He pleads with the police to bring his daughters too but they are left behind. The last he sees of them for weeks is that they run down the street after the truck, crying &#x201C;daddy, daddy&#x201D;. Fortunately, a local housewife took them in, found their mother&#x2019;s address and sent them back to Barberton.</block>
<p>A number of things that had been stated the previous day in <i>The Star</i> had been accepted by the editor as facts. All these facts were wrong except that Mr. Brand Ncube had been arrested. Sir, let us see what the reaction to this article was. I quote once again from <i>The Star</i>&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Two more angry letters over Mr. Ncube&#x2019;s arrest A woman writes as a mother of three young daughters: I was absolutely horrified to read about the arrest of Mr. Brand Ncube for a pass offence while his two small children were left to run screaming after the police. Can one imagine the abject terror of these little girls aged six and eight, left alone in a strange town or the anguish of the father who spent two weeks searching for them. Thank goodness a White housewife had the compassion to care for the children and send them back to their mother in Barberton.</block>
<p>The reader goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">According to the report Mr. Ncube was acquitted after appearing in court the following day. Was it necessary to cause such distress and humiliation over a minor offence?</block>
<p>The second letter I wish to quote under the heading &#x201C;Sickening Report&#x201D; reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Your report in <i>The Star</i> concerning the arrest of Mr. Brand Ncube while his two little children were left to fend for themselves in a strange city is worse than horrifying as you describe it in your editorial. It is in fact sickening. The pettiness of the offence aside, it seems our country is being policed by barbarians whose mentality is no better than that of the inhuman Nazis who ruled Germany from 1933. If ever there was a reason not to remain in this country, it is the fact that by staying here all White South Africans will at some future date be accused of having condoned such acts by our silence in the same way that the German people were branded for the atrocities of the SS. Cry my beloved country!</block>
<p>I want to state quite categorically, Sir, that if these facts were true, I would have felt exactly the same. I would have agreed with what is written in that letter. But what happened? After this devastating article by the editor of <i>The Star</i> had appeared in that newspaper, the police set about finding Mr. Ncube&#x2019;s two little girls. They took Mr. Ncube to Barberton and asked him to show them the house. They first investigated whether there was a woman who had picked up the two helpless little girls. Nobody could find the woman who had rescued these little girls. Nevertheless, the writer of the article said she had been able to find the house where the two little girls lived. The Police took Mr. Ncube to Barberton and asked him to show them the house so that they could see the little girls because the White woman had taken them back. Mr. Ncube could not show them the house he lived in. He started pointing out various houses in which he supposedly lived. Eventually he settled on one house after the police had said to him: &#x201C;But where is the place?&#x201D; They went to that house where a Black person lived. He said he had been living there for 20 years and he did not know Mr. Ncube from a bar of soap.</p>
<p>But, Sir, <i>The Star</i> did not stop at that. An investigative journalist was told by <i>The Star</i> to find out where the two little girls were. They tell us the story of their search. It is a very interesting story. The article written in that regard was headed: &#x201C;A dossier on a search that lead nowhere.&#x201D; Eventually they wrote two leading articles. The first one was written on 10 August and the second one on 25 August.</p>

<p>What year was that?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>1977. The heading of this article was: &#x201C;Ncube&#x2014;no shred of convincing evidence.&#x201D; It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote"><i>The Star</i> tells the full story today of the chain of events, the extensive inquiries and the searches sparked off by the arrest and detention of Mr. Brand Ncube. Mr. Ncube claimed his children were left abandoned at the roadside when he was arrested, etc &#x2026;.</block>
<p>It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">We quoted the Ncube case as one of a number which showed the need for a different police image and for a more adequate response from the Minister and from the Police Chief when policemen must behave. We criticized the police action in the Ncube case and called for a full inquiry. Well, says the editor, justice needs to be done here. The police have held a thorough investigation and have held it swiftly. So has <i>The Star.</i> And Mr. Ncube has been unable to produce a shred of convincing evidence that his children were with him when he was arrested. <i>The Star</i> certainly accepts the police&#x2019;s findings.</block>
<p>Sir, we are very appreciative towards <i>The Star</i> for having published the article I have just quoted.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>They put it right.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>But the damage had been done. That is the point. They did not put those letters right. <i>The Star</i> was not able to stop the spread of this sort of insidious story overseas where people as gullible as the hon. Senator Winchester accept such stories as gospel truth. Then he comes and spreads such stories in this House! <i>The Star</i> did not rectify that, Sir.</p>
<p>Let me complete this. I had representations from the Press Union and I also received representations from various Press people. I have challenged the editor on umpteen occasions in regard to the Ncube case. During the discussions the editor once again raised the Ncube case. He said that I am always quoting the Ncube case. He said that the Ncube case was a case where the truth lay so deep that nobody could find it. That was what he said. But, Mr. President, the point is that if the truth is so deep one should not publish something of this nature. One should exercise a certain amount of care in regard to printing this type of story disparaging about the S.A. Police. I think it is unfair. Quite frankly, I think it is a crime. This is only one example. I do not have time to quote more because I have a lot of things to discuss this afternoon. I do not want to take up too much time of this House.</p>
<p>*Sir, I want to cite <i>The Cape Times</i> as an example. When they conducted that research into the salaries of the police, reporters from <i>The Cape Times</i> came to me. I told them that I would get a Major-General to come down from Pretoria. He is the person who is in charge of our financial matters. I would have asked a Colonel to come down with him. Those two persons could have met the reporters from <i>The Cape Times</i> in an office where the latter could have verified their information.</p>
<p>†They did not accept my offer. In <i>The Cape Times</i> of this morning they publish details of the debate we had in the Other Place. However, they did not tell us why they did not accept my offer. If they are so keen on publishing the truth at all times, why did they not accept my offer of having two high-ranking officers helping them to pin-point the truth? That is the point, Sir.</p>
<p>*Now my question is this: Surely the police form the cornerstone of our democracy and, if that is the case, are they not entitled to protection? Is a policeman not entitled to say: &#x201C;If I do anything wrong, the Press will pick it up and publish it?&#x201D; And I say: &#x201C;I shall assist them in publishing it.&#x201D; But when a policeman has not done anything wrong, is he not entitled to protection so that only the truth is published about him? Surely that is the least one can expect. The Prisons authorities and the Defence Force are similarly protected. Nobody complains about the protection that the Defence Force and the Prisons enjoy, except hon. Senators here.</p>

<p>Yes, of course. I say that the prisons are entitled to protection and if that is the case I maintain that the police are also entitled to protection. And that is all that is happening in regard to this Bill.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, I come now to the hon. Senator Winchester. He asked: &#x201C;Does the hon. the Minister say that everything is fine in the prisons?&#x201D;</p>
<p>†I have never said that newspapers cannot publish the things that are bad in the prisons, Mr. President. But what they used to publish in the old days and what I maintain they should not publish, is the following example. In our prisons we have some of the worst types that you could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>*One of these people is discharged from the prison and he tells a gruesome story that he has sucked out of his thumb to the newspapers. While his fellow-prisoners were tattooing him while he was in prison he was thinking up those stories. After his discharge he naturally looks for publicity and runs to the Press and then one gets the kind of statement to which the hon. Senator Van Schoor has also referred. The discharged prisoner tells a gruesome story about everything that is happening in the prison, while he is in fact the biggest scoundrel one can imagine. One cannot believe a word of what he says; as a matter of fact, Sir, his whole life has consisted of lies and that type is often a habitual criminal. Having told his story to the Press, they say: &#x201C;But that is what the man told us and so we are entitled to believe his story and to publish what he has told us; no one can blame us for doing so.&#x201D; That is the sort of thing that is happening and for that reason the Department of Prisons is trying to protect itself by saying that only the truth concerning a prison can be published.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator asked me whether everything was in order in the prisons. I can tell the hon. Senator Winchester today, and I say this with a full sense of responsibility, that I challenge him to compare any prison in the world with those in South Africa.</p>

<block name="quote">The same type of legislation was passed in Germany in 1923.</block>

<p>Sir, you will remember that the woman referred to the same story in her letter. That is the result of a lie that has been published in a newspaper about the S. A. Police. People immediately say that the same conditions obtain as in Nazi Germany, that the policemen look just like the SS and that consequently South Africa is that type of state. And then an hon. Senator says in this House: &#x201C;It is the same type of legislation that was passed in Nazi Germany.&#x201D;</p>
<p>†Mr. President, when I challenged the hon. Senator to tell me what was done in Nazi Germany, because I was unaware of what happened there, he did not know.</p>
<p>*He then made a general statement of the most serious nature. He insinuated that we were aiming at the same sort of legislation that had been applied in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I am really sorry that it has been necessary for me to waste the time of this hon. House this afternoon on this type of discussion. The hon. Senator then went on to say&#x2014;naturally he is obsessed with Mr. Biko&#x2014;after our two minor squabbles, that I was supposed to have said: &#x201C;Biko died of starvation.&#x201D; We read the following in the same speech&#x2014;</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister is asking me to show him one. I will show him a classic, one known all over the world. Mr. Biko died of starvation.</p>
<p>†Sir, I do not know whether there is a spark of fairness in the hon. Senator Winchester. I do not know, but I am going to find out now whether there is a spark of fairness in him.</p>
<p>*I want to find out now whether that hon. Senator can be reasonable. Here is the statement I issued that day. Sir, please remember what the hon. Senator Winchester said, namely, that I was supposed to have said: &#x201C;Biko died of starvation.&#x201D; What I did say, was the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Since 5 September 1977 he refused his meals and threatened with a hunger strike but he was however regularly supplied with his meals and water which he refused to partake of.</block>
<p>†In all fairness I now want to ask the hon. Senator Winchester whether the aforegoing means that Mr. Biko died of starvation? Did I say that?</p>

<p>But I had the reports of Dr. Laing, in my possession. I did not give these reports to the Press, which I probably should have done. I did however not give it to the Press because an autopsy was being carried out; a specialist and all the doctors were working on the case and in fairness to these medical men I thought it advisable to wait until the specialists were finished with the autopsy. But what happened? This is the report I had in front of me, Sir, signed by the doctor, and it reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Col. Goosen had expressed concern that Biko might have suffered a stroke since he was not eating, nor was he able to speak and was not using his limbs. He had not passed urine during the previous 24 hours and he had refused all offers of food.</block>
<p>On page 3 the doctor says&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">I received a report that he had flung a plate of food off his bed on to the floor with his hands at midday.</block>
<p>Another report signed by Tucker, another doctor, states the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Col. Goosen informed me that he had refused to take food or water for the past three days and during this period had not passed urine or defaecated.</block>
<p>Mr. President, I want to ask the hon. Senator Winchester in fairness to me, whether I was not entitled on the strength of that medical report to make this statement to the Press?&#x2014;</p>

<p>Now what does a post-mortem mean, Sir? The hon. Senator Winchester must tell me what a post-mortem means. A post-mortem means that the doctors are trying to find out the cause of death, and if I say that the doctors are going to try and find out the cause of death, how can it ever be alleged that I said that Mr. Biko had died of starvation?

<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I am testing the fairness of the hon. Senator today. The hon. Senator made another statement against me in regard to this matter. &#x201C;The hon. the Minister said that if he wanted to starve to death, that was his privilege.&#x201D; Now, Sir, what really happened? At the NP congress there was a blind lawyer, a Mr. Venter. I have known this man through the years and I have come to respect his learning. How he acquired it, I do not know, but he is a very learned lawyer and I have come to know this through the years. At that congress this learned lawyer stood up and said something to this effect&#x2014;I do not have the exact words, though I can get them for the hon. Senator&#x2014;that if a man wishes to starve, that is his right; it is his democratic right to do so. That is all he said there. I cannot remember whether I openly agreed with that or whether I gave some noncommittal reply. I cannot remember that today, Mr. President. But I knew what Mr. Venter was speaking about because I am also a lawyer. Mr. Venter was speaking about the rule in Europe which says just that. I shall give it to the hon. member. The only thing I could find to verify what I am telling the hon. Senator Winchester this afternoon&#x2014;I had very little time to check&#x2014;is a report in <i>The World</i> of all things, of 15 September. It says&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Mr. Kruger spoke after being congratu-latedoy Mr. Chris Venter &#x2026;</block>
<p>who I am tellling you is an excellent lawyer&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; a delegate from Springs &#x2026;</block>
<p>and then <i>The World</i> quotes Mr. Venter&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; for being so democratic that those who want to starve themselves to death are allowed to do so.</block>
<p>The paper goes on to say that I agreed with that. I could not disagree with it, and I shall show the hon. Senator why. The reason is very simple. Here again I do not have the exact court cases available&#x2014;with more time I could look them up&#x2014;but I can quote from <i>Rapport</i> of 18 July 1977&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Dood van mnr. Biko en die storm wat daarna losgebars het, bring die kwessie van dwangvoeding &#x2026;</block>
<p>whether you can force a man to eat&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026;van gevangenes sterk op die voor grond.</block>
<p>In other words, if a man wants to starve, is he entitled to starve or is he not entitled to starve? They spoke to Prof. S. R. Strauss&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; hoof van die departement van gereg telike geneeskunde aan Unisa. Dwangvoeding kan tegniese aanranding wees, maar hy kan hom nie voorstel dat &#x2018;n hof iemand in sulke omstandighede aan aanranding skuldig sal vind nie. Die beleid word ook in Europese lande gevolg. In gevolge die Stuttgart-konvensie mag dwangvoeding van &#x2018;n gevangenes in geen een van die Euromark-lande toegepas word nie. Dit word as &#x2019;n gevangene se reg beskou om sy eie lewe deur selfverhonge ring te neem indien hy so besluit. In Brittanje was dit steeds die beleid &#x2026;</block>
<p>and so it continues. In the <i>Medical Practice and Ethics</i> we find a reference to the Japanese Convention, the Declaration of Tokyo. This was adopted at the 29th World Medical Assembly in Tokyo in October 1975. It reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Where a prisoner refuses nourishment and is considered by the doctors capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment concerning the consequences of such a voluntary refusal of nourishment he or she shall not be fed artificially. The decision as to the capacity of the prisoner to form such a judgment should be confirmed by at least one other independent doctor. The consequences of the refusal of nourishment shall be explained by the doctor to the prisoner.</block>
<p>In other words, basically it amounts to this, that a man has a right to starve to death if he so wishes when he is in his right and sober senses. This has been laid down in Europe by the Stuttgart Convention. I knew that, and when Mr. Chris Venter said that, I knew that he and I were talking to one another as lawyers. Nevertheless the hon. Senator comes here and says I made these statements. He attributes these statements to me, as if this was a statement which rocked the world. This was a statement he heard overseas, a statement that shook him to his foundations. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I want to know from the hon. Senator therefore whether he thinks he has been fair to me in this debate or whether he will concede that he has been unfair to me.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why I have dealt with this so fully, Mr. President. I am sick and tired of these allegations and these smears and these half-truths which hon. Senators resort to in the Senate. They smear people and that is why I have dealt with it so fully and I hope that the hon. Senator Winchester will get this out of his system now. I did not say what he alleges I said and there was a reason why this other statement was made. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. President, if you will grant me a few more minutes I should like to say that in Parliament, Sir, we have some of the greatest minds in this country. To this place people are drawn who are leaders in their communities and who are men of good standing and integrity, men of great ability and men of great learning. Most of the people that come to both Houses of Parliament are endowed with qualities of leadership and with some common sense, if not great learning. One need not be an educated man to sit here; one needs a certain amount of common sense.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that as a result of the democratic process it is possible for men of lesser breed to find their way through these portals. Fortunately for our country such men are few and far between. But it does happen that some duffer, some absolute fool, does gain the status of this high office. Such a person is often insensitive to historical movement, is so lacking in a sense of cameraderie and is such an imcompetent nitwit, Sir, that in debates he uses half-truths against honourable people, often not with the intention of hurting but because such a person is too stupid and too lazy to do his homework properly.</p>

<heading>INQUESTS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Committee Stage)</p>
<p>Clause 2:</p>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, there are but two clauses in this Bill and, as far as this side of the House is concerned, we are concerned only with clause 2. I do not intend to use these proceedings as an opportunity to repeat my Second Reading speech. I do feel, however, that I should sum up what I said at the Second Reading.</p>
<p>The first point I made was that this Bill before us and the Police Amendment Bill were complementary to each other. I made the further point that I believed that the object of these two Bills was to cripple investigative journalism if not to neutralize it altogether.</p>
<p>The number of inquest proceedings in which the Press is interested is infinitesimal. I cannot remember the number of inquests that the hon. the Minister advised this hon. House of on the last occasion when this Act was amended, but I think it was about 6 000. I doubt very much, Sir, whether the Press reports on more than 30 or 40 such inquests in any one year. The Press is not interested in the others. In the past the inquest proceedings that attracted the interest of the Press were those dealing with detainees who had died in detention. I believe sincerely that the Nkane and the Biko cases had much to do with the introduction of this Bill, as, in fact, they had much to do, in my view, with the introduction of the Police Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>In my Second Reading speech I said that I doubted very much if the Nkane case would ever have reached the Supreme Court if this Bill and the Police Amendment Bill had been the law of the land at the time of his death. I think the savage penalties provided for in the Police Amendment Bill would deter any editor from investigating a case such as the Nkane case. I suggest that clause 2 of this Bill will deter the investigation of the inquest proceedings. That is my contention.</p>
<p>I wish to read the first words contained in clause 2. They read as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Any person who prejudices, influences or anticipates the proceedings or findings of an inquest &#x2026;</block>
<p>will be guilty of an offence. As I read this, Sir, I suggest that the Press cannot investigate how far inquest proceedings have gone. I believe that if they do so they will be subject to the laws of the land if this Bill becomes law. I certainly believe that the Press will not be allowed to criticize any delay in any inquest proceedings. If they did so, in terms of this clause, they would be influencing the proceedings; they might even be prejudicing the proceedings; they might even be anticipating the proceedings; but they certainly would be influencing the proceedings. The result is that the tendency will be that inquest proceedings, in my view again, will be left in limbo. That is precisely what happened in the matters which were referred to and which formed the subject of a question I put to the hon. the Minister in 1977, and which I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to explain in the course of his reply. [Interjections.] I suggest that that is precisely what happened in those cases which were referred to in a question by me to the hon. the Minister in 1977. They were left in limbo. To use the words of Advocate De Villiers which he was using with reference to the Police Amendment Bill, I quote the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The effect of the Bill will be to effectively draw a veil over proceedings where police are the subject of the inquiry and where there has been a wrongdoing by police.</block>
<p>I suggest to you, Sir, that when the two Bills taken in concert become law as assuredly they will, cases against the police will never see the light of day. That is the objection in short and in summary that I have and that this side of the House has against this Bill.</p>
<p>I asked the hon. the Minister certain questions concerning the question which I had on the Order Paper in 1977. I was at pains to say to the hon. the Minister on that occasion that I did not expect him to reply immediately as obviously this matter would take some time to investigate. I think the hon. the Minister has now had sufficient time to investigate these matters. Without taking up the time of this hon. House, any further, I should like the hon. the Minister to answer the questions that I asked him. I did not only ask him what had happened about those inquest proceedings referred to in the question concerned for the 15-month period mentioned in the question. I asked him to give us a rundown on the inquest proceedings over the period of time when some 35 detainees died from different causes while in detention. I should be much obliged to the hon. the Minister if he could indicate to us what happened in those cases.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall do so with pleasure. As I understood it, the hon. Senator wanted to know why the inquests in respect of the cases that he asked me about in question 61 on 23 March 1977, had taken so long to complete. Is that correct? The hon. Senator wished to know why they had taken such a long time and what had happened to them?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I went through question 61 of 23 March 1977. I am sorry to take up the House&#x2019;s time on this matter but unfortunately it must be done.</p>
<p>The first case is that of Frank Mapethla Mohati who died on 5 August 1976. On 15 September 1976 Attorney Mxenge wrote to the magistrate, King William&#x2019;s Town, requesting a delay of three months before the inquest was placed on the roll. The matter was consequently placed on the roll for 17, 18 and 19 January 1977. The inquest was not completed by 19 January and was set down for 14, 15 and 16 March 1977. By 16 March the inquest had still not been completed.</p>
<p>The advocate for the family of the deceased required time for the examination of the handwriting on an alleged suicide note, and the magistrate conducting the inquest also had to go on a course for regional magistrates. The result was that the first date which suited all concerned was 19 September 1977. The inquest was postponed until that date. At this stage the Department&#x2019;s head office intervened and insisted that the matter be expedited. It was then set down for 4, 5 and 6 July 1977. The inquest was finalized on 8 July 1977. The finding was that the death had not been brought about by any act or omission involving or amounting to an offence on the part of any person.</p>
<p>The second case I want to quote is Ernest Mamashila who died on 19 November 1976. There were certain problems regarding the post-mortem report and it was only finalized on 17 January 1977. This was from November. On 21 January 1977 the police docket was forwarded to the public prosecutor at Balfour. He decided not to prosecute and placed the matter before the magistrate at Balfour on 24 January 1977 in terms of section 5(1) of the Inquests Act. In terms of section 5(2) of the Act the magistrate decided to hold an inquest and returned the documents to the prosecutor so that the relatives of the deceased could be informed in terms of section 7 of the Act. Problems were experienced in obtaining their addresses, and they were informed on 24 February 1977 that the inquest would be held on 10 March 1977. The inquest was disposed of on that day and the magistrate found that the death had not been brought about by any act or omission involving or amounting to an offence on the part of any person.</p>
<p>In regard to the hon. Senator&#x2019;s question of 28 March 1977, we unfortunately stated that the inquest had not yet been completed whereas the inquest had in actual fact been completed on 10 March 1977 although there had apparently been no nexus between the department and the magistrate. Apparently the documents had not reached the department when the question was asked.</p>
<p>The third case is that of Wellington Mlungini Tshazibane. He died on 11 December 1976 and on 21 February 1977 the public prosecutor in Johannesburg decided not to prosecute. The documents were then forwarded to the section dealing with inquests where a query was directed to a Professor Taljaard in connection with the post-mortem report. This mattter was finalized on 8 March 1977, whereafter the documents were placed before a magistrate for decision. On 30 March 1977 the deceased&#x2019;s relatives were informed that an inquest would be held on 21 April 1977. It was disposed of on that day and it was found that death had not been brought about by any act or omission involving or amounting to an offence on the part of any person.</p>
<p>The following case is that of Luke Mazwembe who died on 2 September 1976. By 19 October 1976 the police investigation had been concluded and the docket was handed to the public prosecutor at Cape Town. Arrangements were made for an informal inquest to be held on 11 November 1976. On this date Advocate Farlam, who acted for the deceased relatives, requested that a formal inquest be held. The request was granted. Witnesses had to be subpoenaed and the matter was set down for 27 January 1977. Evidence was adduced on this date and Advocate Farlam requested that the security police file on the deceased be made available to the magistrate conducting the inquest. The inquest was postponed for this purpose. No date for the resumption of the proceedings was fixed because it could not be ascertained which date would suit all concerned. By 1 February 1977 the magistrate had perused the said file and 24 March 1977 was determined as the date which suited all concerned. On that date, however, Advocate Farlam was not available, as he had to appear elsewhere. He requested a further postponement. The matter was set down for 9 June but again had to be postponed because Advocate Farlam was not available. The date for the resumption of the proceedings was finally fixed for 24 June 1977. The advocate was able to appear on this date but requested a further postponement for the purpose of calling a witness. This witness, one Sikane, who was to become the deputy commissioner of police of Bophutha tswana, was at that stage on a training course and was not available to give evidence before 8 September 1977. The inquest was finally disposed of on that date and the magistrate found that the death had not been brought about by any act or omission involving or amounting to an offence on the part of any person.</p>
<p>The fifth case I quote is that of George Botha. He died on 15 December 1976. The police investigation lasted until 15 March 1977 when the docket was handed to the public prosecutor at Port Elizabeth. The following day, on 16 March, attorney Mxenge&#x2014;I am sorry I cannot pronounce the Xhosa names&#x2014;was informed that no prosecution would be instituted and the matter would be placed before a magistrate with a view to holding an inquest. On 19 April 1977 a magistrate decided to hold an inquest and the relatives of the deceased were informed on 20 April 1977 that it would be held on 3 May 1977. The inquest was finally disposed of on 5 May 1977 and it was found that the death had not been brought about by any act or omission involving or amounting to an offence on the part of any person.</p>
<p>The sixth case is that of Nanaoth Ntshuntsha who died on 9 January 1977. The police investigation lasted for about six months and on 10 June 1977 the S.A. Police forwarded the docket directly to the Attorney-General in Pretoria. On 21 June 1977 the Attorney-General directed that the documents be placed before the magistrate, Ivanda. On 8 July 1977 he decided that an inquest should be held. Negotiations for a suitable date then began with attorney Shun Chetty, advocate Wentzel, the State attorney and a pathologist The matter was eventually set down for 1 September 1977. On that day the legal representatives of the deceased&#x2019;s relatives applied for a postponement until 15 September 1977. The inquest was then postponed until 5 October 1977 for further evidence and on this date the proceedings were concluded. The magistrate found that the death had not been brought about by any act or omission involving or amounting to an offence on the part of any person.</p>
<p>The seventh case is that of Matthews Mabelane who died on 15 February 1977. On 10 March 1977 the Attorney-General decided not to prosecute. The relevant documents were prepared and placed before a magistrate in Johannesburg on 25 March 1977. He decided that an inquest should be held on 1 April. The relatives of the deceased were informed on 1 April. <i>Viva voce</i> evidence was first adduced on 14 April. On this date advocate Libowitz, who acted for the relatives of the deceased on instructions from attorney Shun Chetty, applied for a postpone ment until 22 April. On this date he applied for a further postponement until 30 May 1977 to allow him to investigate. The proceedings were concluded on that date and the finding was that the death had not been brought about by any act or omission involving or amounting to an offence on the part of any person.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not know about any other questions. I was under the impression that this was the only question that was really worrying the hon. Senator. I think the hon. Senator will also agree with me that all these cases I have just quoted indicate that it was not the fault of the department or of the police if any delays occurred. I think I have given full details. There is no cover-up; I may tell the hon. Senator that. If any other questions are worrying the hon. Senator, I ask him to put them in writing in which case I will be only too willing to answer them.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I am obliged to the hon. the Minister for his very full explanation as to what actually took place. I feel that it is in the best interests of all of us that we should know the facts and that we should have had a reply such as the hon. the Minister has given. I personally am satisfied that no blame can rest upon the department or any of its officials for the very lengthy delays in the completion of these inquests.</p>
<p>At this juncture I should, however, like to say that there were certain other questions that I put to the hon. the Minister. I do not blame him for not recollecting them but I did use these words: I want to go further and also ask the hon. the Minister whether the inquests in respect of detainees who had died not through natural causes before the date I gave, i.e. January 1976&#x2014;I should have said 1977&#x2014; have been concluded or whether they have not been concluded. I wanted to know the position in regard to deaths in detention after the date I gave, i.e. 23 March 1977.</p>
<p>But, Sir, it was not with the object of tricking the hon. the Minister. I am satisfied that the matter has gone far enough. I do not ask the hon. the Minister to carry out a further investigation; I am satisfied that that would be an exercise in futility. However, I think it does give a point to what I have said in regard to this Bill. This has shown that for long periods of time, inquest proceedings are &#x2014;to use the words that I have used through out&#x2014;kept in limbo, of necessity, and not necessarily because of negligence and definitely not because of the intent of any official. During this period of time my point is that in terms of clause 2 of the Bill, these matters cannot be investigated; no question can be put by the Press to the authorities concerned as to why there is this delay. From my reading of the Bill that is clear, Sir. That is the objection this side has to this Bill.</p>
<p>If this clause 2 is read in conjunction with the Police Amendment Bill, I maintain it will have the effect of stifling investigative journalism. I still maintain that the one is complementary to the other. I have not said throughout these proceedings that this Bill is as serious as the one of which the Second Reading was concluded today. That Bill is the one that I find most obnoxious. I am still not satisfied that the hon. the Minister has proved to us that this Bill is necessary. I do not believe that it is.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-justice">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I have seen an amendment on the Order Paper. I should, however, first like to reply to the statement by the hon. Senator. He said that no question may be put until the inquest has been completed. That is not correct.</p>
<p>†Investigative journalism can carry on freely. It is only after the magistrate, in terms of the Act, has decided to have an inquest that newspapers cannot publish it. But it remains fresh because when the inquest takes place, it is news again. The investigative journalism should by then have been thoroughly done. Questions can be asked, the whole thing can be prepared and they can, should they want to, write about it But, of course, it would be very helpful if the Press made available to the defence or to the advocates concerned, whatever they may have found out. All this can take place in the meantime, as long as it does not influence the magistrate in his finding.</p>

<speech by="#zijl">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. H. S. VAN ZIJL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I actually wanted to say what the hon. the Minister has just said. I want to move an amendment but in order to do so I have to repeat to some extent what the hon. the Minister has already said. The objective of the amendment I want to move is to place inquests in the same category as all other court cases, i.e. to establish uniformity. All other court cases enjoy the benefit of the <i>sub judice</i> rule and we now want to make the <i>sub judice</i> rule applicable in the case of inquests as well. That does not place any restriction on the Press but it confers the status of all other court cases on inquests. Because inquests will now have the same status it does not follow that the Press has been dealt a death blow. As the hon. the Minister has said, the Press has the right to conduct investigations into everything that has happened beforehand. In the case of a death there is usually a police investigation and a post-mortem where necessary, and the findings are submitted to the public prosecutor. The Press is free to publish reports concerning all those stages; the Press can do what it wants to up to the stage when the presiding officer is appointed. After that the <i>sub judice</i> rule comes into force. But up to that stage the Press is free to publish reports to its heart&#x2019;s content concerning the death.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, it is my privilege, on behalf of a very highly esteemed colleague, to move an amendment Unfortunately, my highly esteemed colleague has been promoted to a higher rank and consequently he is unable to move the amendment himself; that task consequently rests on my shoulders.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I doubt whether I shall be able to move the amendment with the same measure of clarity and dignity as my hon. colleague would have been able to do-But I would appeal to the hon. House and to you, Sir, to bear with me in the execution of my task.</p>
<p>Section 5 of the principal Act provides for the <i>sub judice</i> rule and if clause 5 is amended as envisaged in the amendment the insertion of clause 5 will have the same effect as it has now. The objective is not, therefore, to change the existing section but merely to bring it into line with the principal Act. Mr. Chairman, allow me to explain the amendment as my hon. colleague would have done. When criminal proceedings are instituted in connection with a death, the <i>sub judice</i> comes into effect immediately&#x2014;that is, in respect of section 5&#x2014;and the same provisions apply as those contained in clause 2 of the amending Bill before us, i.e. that the findings of an inquest may not be prejudiced, influenced or anticipated.</p>
<p>Subsection (2) of section 5 provides&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">If on the information submitted to him in terms of subsection (1) it appears to the magistrate that a death has occurred and that such death was not due to natural causes, he shall proceed to hold an inquest as to the circumstances and cause of the death.</block>
<p>The effect of the application of the provisions of section 5 will be precisely the same as that of the amendment I intend moving to this clause. However, the amendment will bring the clause more into line with the principal Act Therefore, I move the amendment, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to say one or two things to the hon. the Minister. Firstly, I think that it is generally agreed on this side of the House that this clause and the previous Bill have a great deal in common. They are virtually twins because they have the same intention. Some of the remarks I intended to make, I will leave until we again discuss the Bill we have just dealt with and will at the same time reply to the attack the hon. the Minister made on me.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, the hon. the Minister and I will continously have words while I sit in this House, and I am quite prepared to take what I get as well. But I want to say this to the hon. the Minister in regard to the Bill before us&#x2014;I will reply to the other matters at the appropriate time&#x2014;I am no lawyer as the hon. the Minister knows. [Interjections.] Yes, but I probably have a little more common sense than a number of the lawyers on the other side of the House have. Sir, as far as I do know, an inquest court has nothing in common with the ordinary court of law. Surely, the hon. Senator Van Zijl who has just resumed his seat and moved an amendment which, I must confess, makes no sense whatever to me, must admit that an inquest court has nothing in common with a court of law, a magistrate&#x2019;s court or the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>It has an administrative function; it is a different thing entirely. Mr. Chairman, I am not going to get involved with lawyers because every time I do it costs me a lot of money. I want to say to the hon. Senators opposite that, first of all, that is certainly one of the things I understand&#x2014;they have very little or nothing in common at all. One is an administrative matter. But the hon. the Minister can talk until he is blue in the face; the fact of the matter is that this is another curb on the freedom of the Press. The hon. the Minister can pull a face and shake his head, but what else can it be? I asked the hon. the Minister when we discussed the Police Amendment Bill to give me an example of why it was necessary. He gave me a most dramatic example, Mr. Chairman, which I will look into and then suitably reply to. But can he give me an example of where the sort of thing has happened that has made this particular Bill necessary?</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, there is another aspect in this regard. The magistrate expresses an opinion in an inquest hearing, not a verdict, as I understand it. Publicity will bring forward more witnesses to a particular incident But having said all that, Sir, the horrible thought keeps going through my mind: Couple this Bill with the previous Bill and one or two others that we have had recently and one that we are being threatened with right at this very moment, and we find that the whole freedom of expression, freedom of the Press is being stifled by nice-sounding words, various amendments and this little clause here. Mr. Chairman, it is a very short clause, only two or three lines, but ultimately those two or three lines are going to the death-knell of all the freedoms we believe in. As I have said before and I say again, it amazes me that hon. Senators opposite can allow themselves to be taken along this road which leads to nothing but the end of democracy.</p>

<p>The hon. Senator may not like the road I travel, Mr. Chairman; that is not important. I firmly believe in freedom of speech and I believe in democracy. Perhaps the hon. Senator does too, but he is legally trained and he should stop these things more quickly than other people do. Mr. Chairman, it could be put in one line, it could be put in two lines, but when you start interfering with the freedom of the Press, you interfere with freedom of expression. When you do that, you kill democracy slowly but surely and inevitably. If for no other reason than that, I as a layman must oppose legislation of this sort. It disturbs me tremendously to see the hon. Senators on the other side can so lightly toss away the freedoms which their forebears fought for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to repeat what I said during the Second Reading debate although it is relevant to the amendment as well as the clause as such. We shall have to ensure that justice is done to this institution, the court. Although this institution is a court of inquiry it is a properly constituted body consisting of a magistrate with one or two assessors. It has the status, standing and dignity of a court and in order to uphold that status and dignity it is essential that it is protected. The hon. Senator Winchester is very concerned about the Press. We too are concerned about the Press. We do not want to harm the Press in any way but if there is anything in this country that has a higher value than the Press, it is I think, a court of law, a judicial institution whose task it is to ensure that justice is done in this country. Investigations in connection with inquests are equally important, if not more important, than the Press or any other institutions outside the law. Hon. gentlemen opposite, hon. gentlemen on this side, the Government and the department all adopt this attitude and we are all jealous of the status of our law courts and all aspects of the administration of justice in this country. We cannot allow any peculiarities that will invite contempt and detract from the dignity of proceedings such as inquests.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I did not study the amendment beforehand but, like hon. Senators opposite, I have listened to the arguments in its favour and I think it is right that the magistrate and his one or two assessors should be able to approach this task objectively in the light of the evidence before them and in the light of the cross-examination of witnesses etc. so that they can arrive at a fair decision and make a reasonable recommendation to the Attorney-General, if that has to be done. It is absolutely essential for the <i>sub judice</i> rule to apply in this case as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support this amendment on condition that the hon. the Minister and his legal advisers approve of it. I do not want to anticipate their decision. It does seem to me, however, that we are on the right road.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the amendment moved will facilitate matters considerably. That was the complaint in the Other Place as well as the complaint by the Press&#x2014;that they did not know at what stage one was prohibited from writing about a matter. Now there is a definite time laid down. It gives legal certainty. In that respect it is a good amendment.</p>
<p>In reply to the hon. Senator Winchester I want to say that it does not affect the freedom of the Press but what it does seek to prevent&#x2014;and I do not think this is unreasonable; I hope the hon. gentleman will concede this&#x2014;is the Press conducting its own inquest beforehand and only seeing things from one angle. It is not unreasonable of the Government to say: Here is an inquiry; do all your investigations, write about them, give your opinions; but when the actual court is sitting, that is, the inquest itself, you must leave things until it is finished. After that you can write as much as you like. Press freedom is not curbed here. All that happens is that the magistrate is protected from opinions which are expressed, public evaluation of the evidence&#x2014;which is the work of the magistrate&#x2014; and so on. This is distasteful and it is wrong, and these are important inquiries. The death is registered on the basis of this inquiry. After this inquiry the death certificate can be finally issued. Divorces are granted after these inquiries; in other words, it is now accepted that the man is dead. In actual fact it is an important legal process and the magistrate is therefore entitled to operate under the same circumstances as a magistrate in a court or a judge on the bench. That is why I think that with this amendment of the hon. Senator Van Zijl we have achieved legal certainty, and it is definitely not unreasonable.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have waited patiently to hear the hon. the Minister give us one example of why it has become necessary to introduce this new provision into the law. I have waited patiently but in vain. He has not given us an example which has made this necessary. He gave a concrete example when the hon. Senator Winchester stuck his neck out as regards the Bill which preceded this one. As the hon. Senator Winchester has said, it was a very effective reply. Why can he not give us an example now of why this is necessary? You know, Sir, I have said that I do not believe there are more than 30 or 40 inquests a year which interest the Press. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me. I do not think there are more than 30 or 40 a year. What the hon. the Minister has in mind, surely, is the one inquest proceeding where this protection is necessary for the magistrate. I agree that this is a very important administrative body, and that the proceedings are important, and it is important to our law that we should have it. But I should like to know why it is necessary for us to change the law. I have only asked for one example. The hon. the Minister was asked by the hon. Senator Winchester&#x2014;and as I see it this was the specific object for his getting to his feet&#x2014;to give him an example. He wanted only one example from the hon. the Minister, but he has not given it to us.</p>
<p>You know, Sir, I have come to the conclusion that the reason why this has been introduced is because of the Biko case. I think that is the reason &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is not customary, of course, for a consolidating Bill to be discussed. But I should like to make use of this opportunity to say something in this connection because I really grew up with the original Act. Sir, I think I am the only person in this House and in the Other Place who served in the Provincial Council and was connected with the profession at any time before this legislation was enacted in 1934. The profession welcomes this legislation. As the hon. the Minister has said, more than 26 amendments have been effected to the original Act over the years. Each amendment moved has been carefully considered by the law societies concerned and the Association of Law Societies of South Africa. It is my pleasure today to say that over the years the profession has co-operated with the Ministers of Justice concerned to assist in bringing about these amendments. I should also like to express appreciation for the sympathy we have received in recent years from the present hon. Minister regarding amendments which we have suggested. My late father, who was also a member of this House, was, <i>inter alia</i>, a member of the select committee which dealt with the original legislation in 1934. Since then we have also had the Act of 1941 dealing with trust funds, which is so valuable to our profession and to the public. At present it is a multi-million rand fund and anybody can with an open mind and the best will in the world make use of the profession. This Bill before us today with its consolidating measures is a further step we welcome. We want to express our thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister, as well as to his officials who have worked hard to make this possible and were at all times available to us as a profession to help us in discussions on the matter. I am sure the goodwill which prevails between the profession and the hon. the Minister and his officials will continue, not only in the interests of the profession but also in the interests of the public of South Africa.</p>

<heading>PRISONS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-justice">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF PRISONS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>I wish to deal briefly with the basic aspects arising out of this Bill.</p>
<p><i>Release of prisoners</i></p>
<p>As long ago as 26 January 1978, I gave the Commissioner of Prisons authority to approve of the release on parole of prisoners with sentences not exceeding two years without my prior consent In terms of the existing provisions of the Prisons Act, the Commissioner may only delegate these powers in terms of section 93(3) of the Act to commissioned officers of or above the rank of brigadier. The administrative process in respect of the release of prisoners on parole can, however, be facilitated if the approval of release on parole of prisoners with sentences not exceeding two years can be delegated by the Commissioner to selected officers who need not necessarily hold the rank of brigadier or a higher rank. This problem is being overcome by empowering the Commissioner by law to authorize such releases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, provision is also being made for express authority for the issue and execution of a warrant for the arrest and detention of a parolee who has failed to observe a condition of his release on parole.</p>
<p><i>Treatment, training and employment of prisoners</i></p>
<p>At present no effective legal sanctions exist for the treatment, training and employment of all sorts of prisoners accommodated in prison hospitals for psychopaths, and these lacunae are being eliminated.</p>
<p><i>Execution of warrants in respect of judgment debtors</i></p>
<p>No legal provision exists as to how two or more warrants of detention in terms of section 65(9)(d) of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act, 1944, as amended, issued on the same day or in quick succession and applicable to the same person, should be executed.</p>
<p>Over the years, however, this department has regarded the periods indicated on various warrants as accumulative and not as concurrent, except where this has been expressly indicated on the warrant. Such a provision is considered essential in order to remove any uncertainty that may exist in this regard.</p>

<heading>LIQUOR AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-justice">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>This Bill, which was published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> on 24 November 1978 for information, can be divided into three parts.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are three clauses largely relating to administrative matters. Section 23(6)(a) of the Liquor Act does not state clearly when and by whom a copy of an application for a special authority to sell liquor, should be sent to the local authority. The amendment proposed in clause 1 makes it perfectly clear that the applicant has to send it to the local authority before his application is considered by the Liquor Board.</p>
<p>When an application is made for holding a special meeting to consider an application for a new liquor licence or a special authority, an amount of R200 is payable in terms of section 40(1)(a) of the Act.</p>
<p>In addition, an applicant also has to pay the application fee as prescribed in section 40(1)(c) in the case of an application for a new liquor licence. This requirement is laid down in section 40(2), but an application for special authority is not included. There is no justification for this and this shortcoming is now being rectified in clause 6.</p>
<p>When liquor licences and special authorities are granted, conditions and restrictions are imposed. It does happen that licence and authority holders require the temporary suspension of some condition for a good reason, but no provision is made for this. Clause 7 envisages making this possible on application by the licence or authority holder.</p>
<p>†A second part of this Bill concerns grocers&#x2019; wine licences. The clauses dealing with this aspect are 2, 4, 5 and 8. At present a grocer&#x2019;s wine licence can, in terms of section 146, only be held by a person who holds a general dealer&#x2019;s licence and who must, at all times, carry on the business of selling groceries and foodstuffs. Section 30 places further restrictions on the granting of this type of licence. Firstly, there is a restriction on what is referred to as a &#x201C;disqualified person in relation to the premises&#x201D;. The provisions of the Group Areas Act govern matters of this nature. The second restriction contained in section 30 is that a grocer&#x2019;s wine licence may not be granted if an objector proves that during the twelve months preceding the date of the application, the total number of litres of table wine sold within the district by the holders of liquor store licences, wholesale licences directly to the public, hotel off-sales privileges and special authorities for off-sales, exceeded thirty per cent of the total number of litres of all liquor sold for off-consumption during the said twelve months. These restrictions are to be repealed by clause 2.</p>
<p>In 1960 one of the recommendations of the Malan Liquor Commission was that provision should be made in the Liquor Act for the sale in grocery stores of table wine and malt beer. In 1963 a draft Bill in which effect was given to, <i>inter alia</i>, this recommendation, was published, but the provision met with such opposition, particularly from the retail trade, that by the time the Bill was introduced, beer had been omitted. Pressure was applied, on the one hand by church bodies, temperance institutions and the licensed retail trade as well to get the grocer&#x2019;s wine licence provision deleted from the Bill, and on the other hand by the primary producers to have the provision retained. In the end the 30% restriction was inserted. This has had the effect that particularly in the Western Cape no grocer has over the past 15 years even made an effort to apply for a grocer&#x2019;s wine licence.</p>
<p>The KWV and the wine farmers consider this restriction to be discriminatory against the inhabitants of the Western Cape, which is our wine producing area. The wine farmers have for many years been asking for the repeal of this restriction. I have now, in view of the fact that it is also intended to allow the holders of certain retail liquor licences to establish wine counters in grocery stores, and for other reasons, come to the conclusion that the 30% restriction can be suspended.</p>
<p>In 1963, as now, the main argument against the sale of table wine in grocery stores was that it would give rise to alcoholism. It is my view that the sale of table wines in grocery stores had not had the result predicted in 1963. The fact that in 15 years only 56 such licences have come into existence, must be an indication that applications of this nature are dealt with circumspectly.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the wine counter in grocery stores. Clauses 4 and 8 are the clauses dealing with that aspect I have also pointed out that in terms of section 146 a grocer&#x2019;s wine licence may only be granted to a grocer. The proposed amendments will make it possible to grant such a licence to the holder of a liquor store licence and of a hotel off-sales privilege to operate a wine counter in a grocery store belonging to another person.</p>
<p>*The third principle dealt with in the Bill, affects wine farmers&#x2019; licences. In terms of section 31 of the Act a wine farmer&#x2019;s licence can only be granted to a person who is engaged in viticulture. The amendment proposed in clause 3 envisages making it possible to grant a wine farmer&#x2019;s licence to an association of persons which does not cultivate wine grapes itself and is not therefore engaged in viticulture, but whose members are for the most part engaged in viticulture. Secondly, the clause seeks to maintain those licences granted since 1928 in conflict with a strict interpretation of the Act&#x2014;and there are in fact associations which hold such licences. It is not the aim that more wine farmers&#x2019; licences will necessarily be granted as a result of the amendment. Each application for such a licence will be considered after due account has been taken of existing needs.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am also not tied. I have pleasure therefore in lending my support in the same spirit as the hon. Senator Crook to the proposed amendments. I particularly want to stress the licence to grocery stores. I do this because the housewife makes weekly visits to these shops to buy her requirements for the week. In future she will have a very realistic idea of the amount of money she spends on liquor. I am convinced that it will counter alcoholism, because she will realize that each one of the family has to be fed and that liquor purchases should only account for a part of the money she has to spend. I think this will give a far more realistic picture of one&#x2019;s daily habits because it includes liquor as well as food. The housewife in particular has a sound idea of that aspect of life.</p>
<p>I am happy to support the legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am opposed to this legislation. I want to make it quite clear that I am not a prohibitionist and not even a teetotaller. However, I want to bring home to some hon. Senators some of my personal views in regard to this matter. The hon. Senator Crook has said the official Opposition in this House has a free vote and the official Opposition in the Other Place had a free vote as well. I do not know whether the Nationalist Party members have got a free vote. It seems to me that they have and they have not However, they will all vote for the party and all of them will thank the hon. the Minister as they always do. However, I would love to see them having a free vote on this issue. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I am expressing a very personal view in regard to this matter; I am quite sure the hon. the Minister understands that What I say therefore is not directed at anybody or at any organization. It is directed at society in general as we find it in South Africa. I want to emphasize that I enjoy a glass of wine every now and then; I am not a teetotaller.</p>
<p>The point is that I believe that the freer sale of liquor is going to be harmful to our society. Sir, you know that in South Africa we already have one of the biggest alcohol problems in the world. We have a number of unsavoury records and this, unfortunately, is one of them. Therefore I find it strange that the Government should facilitate the sale of liquor. I do not expect them to restrict or prohibit it because that would be absolutely silly and fatal to their objectives. However, I object to the Government, as the governing body, taking such a great interest in liquor in South Africa. I want to tell hon. Senators on the other side that if they were to examine Hansard over the past few years and see how often we have amended the Liquor Act in this Parliament, they would be amazed. I have been here since 1966 and can hardly recall a parliamentary session when the Liquor Act has not been amended. In every instance it has been amended to make the sale of liquor more free. This, surely, is something that should cause us concern.</p>
<p>I took the trouble to look it up the other day and found sixteen amendments to the Liquor Act since 1966. We seem to be obsessed with liquor in this place.</p>

<p>I have told you how many amendments to the Liquor Act we have passed since 1966. I want to give you some figures, Sir. It is estimated that over-indulgence in the use of liquor and liquor offences cost South Africa over R40 million a year. R40 million a year is being wasted. Mr. President, let us look at some other figures. In one year more than 12 000 people were convicted of driving under the influence of liquor. [Interjections.] The hon. Senator says &#x201C;yes&#x201D;; he probably does not know this so he just says yes. But it proves that we have a problem. Cannot hon. Senators see that we have a major problem in South Africa and that it is caused by the abuse of liquor? Of course, we have other problems. We have a Nationalist Party that is a problem.</p>

<p>Mr. President, let me point out something else to the hon. House. Hon. Senators do not seem to appreciate this. I say the Government has a tremendous stake in the liquor industry, hence these amendments. Look at it from this point of view: The Coloured Development Corporation has spent over R8 million on the provision of liquor stores in Coloured areas. The Coloured community has one of the biggest alcohol problems of any society anywhere. There is not an hon. Senator, particularly from the Western Cape, who does not agree with that statement. And yet, the Government persists in using its own money and public money to encourage the sale of liquor among the Coloured community. Surely, that is a national disgrace? It knows there is a problem in that society and that liquor is that problem but it uses taxpayers&#x2019; money to foster the sale of liquor in that very society that has this major problem.</p>

<p>It is my day for being &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D; because I cannot get through to the hon. Senator otherwise.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I know the hon. the Minister has looked at the various representations in this matter; he has discussed the matter with other people. I am sure he saw what was said by the Chairman of the S.A. Temperance Alliance where he in fact accused the Government of stubbornness and arrogance over the past two decades by making liquor more accessible to all people. Surely this should concern us.</p>
<p>Sir, I can get hot under the collar for a very good reason. Since I became interested in politics, one of my interests has been the communities of various population groups, particularly the Indian and Coloured people, and the abuse of liquor in these communities is a major and very serious problem. If hon. Senators opposite had seen some of the suffering caused by the abuse of liquor, they would not treat this particular Bill so light heartedly.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I am not opposed to the moderate use of liquor, but I am opposed to this Government&#x2019;s getting itself involved in the propagation of the freer sale and supply of liquor. And I can come to no other conclusion than that the hon. the Minister, wittingly or unwittingly, allows himself to be used, allows the Government to be used to encourage the sale of liquor.

<p>Well, I am glad to know that he is on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s side this time. Mr. President, I recently looked at one particular daily newspaper in South Africa and, whereas a few years ago one would have noticed that motor-car advertising took up most of the advertising space in that newspaper&#x2014;more space was devoted to the advertising of motor-cars than to anything else&#x2014;one now notices that the advertising of liquor has taken its place. The amount spent on advertising to promote the sale of liquor now probably far outweighs that spent on advertising motorcars. Liquor has become the major topic of advertising in South Africa. Liquor is advertised on the radio and on TV and liquor advertising has become a major industry. I say, let them stand on their own feet If they want to do that, that is fine. But I believe it is wrong, inherently wrong for a Government to get involved in making the sale of liquor easier, and therefore I oppose this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. President it is a long time since an hon. Senator in this hon. House has made as confused a speech as that made by the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat. It is very clear to me that he has no idea of the subject presently under discussion because he takes exception to the Minister and, of course, the Government becoming involved in this matter. Up to now wine could not be sold in this way, and if one wanted to make this possible, how else could it be done than that the Minister should effect an amendment to the Act? I cannot see how the hon. Senator could raise such an argument in this House.</p>
<p>If I understood him correctly, he advocates a greater degree of prohibition being implemented; in other words, we should really try to promote prohibition. If ever anything failed, it was the implementation of prohibition in the USA. During the period of prohibition in the USA there was an unbelievable increase in drunkenness. In other words, when liquor was more freely available, the abuse of liquor decreased. This is what experience has taught us. So I cannot understand why the hon. Senator pleads for the promotion of prohibition.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I make no secret of the fact that I am a wine farmer and I am proud of it. Wherever I go, I shall do my best to promote the moderate use of wine. Just like the hon. Senator Winchester, I am opposed to the abuse of liquor, but our methods differ widely. I am sure that he does not speak for a single wine farmer when he opposes the granting of wine licences to grocery stores. I do not know of one wine farmer who would support him in his representations. He is like a voice crying in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity of assuring the hon. the Minister that all the wine farmers welcome the proposed amendment.</p>

<p>We welcome it because we believe that in this way we will promote the moderate use of wine and in so doing eventually counter drunkenness. I refer to the third point which the hon. Senator raised regarding the number of amendments that have been effected to the Liquor Act over the years. I think he said there had been 17. His figure is correct, Sir, but it proves nothing, because none of these amendments referred to the freer availability of liquor. I want to give an example which might interest the hon. Senator. About three years ago a motion was moved here as a result of which the Act was amended to enable the KWV to import distilling wine from France because there was a shortage at that time.</p>
<p>Now I want to tell the hon. Senator something he does not know. The profit the KWV made from that undertaking, that is on the import of distilling wine that year from France, was of such a nature that the KWV were able to undertake such projects as the wine houses Paddagang at Tulbagh, La Bori at Paarl and Kleinplasie at Worcester, and it is engaged upon a further project at Stellenbosch. All this was done from the profits the KWV made from that distilling wine. These were not profits which came from the wine farmers&#x2019; product.</p>
<p>I wonder if the hon. Senator knows all that is done at a wine house such as La Bori at Paarl, and what is offered there. If he knew anything about it, he would see this amendment in a totally different light, and I should like to invite him to visit them if he has not done so yet [Interjections.] I am willing to be his host and to foot the bill. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I speak on behalf of the wine farmers when I say that we heartily welcome this amendment I also want to express the hope that there will be no undue delay in granting these licences.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>I want to say at the outset, to put the Minister&#x2019;s mind at rest, that I support the legislation, because, in my view, it is not the use of alcohol that causes problems, but the abuse of alcohol.</p>
<p>Some years ago many of us were perturbed when the Government decided to make White man&#x2019;s liquor available to the Black man. We feared the consequences; we wondered what would come of this and what we were letting ourselves in for. The facts have proved our fears to be wrong. I think the Black man has shown quite clearly that he was able to handle this situation responsibly. In my opinion, there is less drunkenness now than there was prior to the passing of that legislation.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, the availability of wine at grocers&#x2019; shops&#x2014;particularly if this is at a counter handled by the hotels&#x2014;it is to be welcomed. If anything, I think this may well reduce drunkenness, because people will know they can get wine to have with their meals when they want it. They do not have to store up much more than they need for some special occasion, and then perhaps drink it all at once instead of drinking in moderation.</p>
<p>I have one thought which I think I should mention to the hon. the Minister, and that is that the hotels have been made to spend a lot of money in classifying and grading. There has been a definite improvement in the quality of the service to the community as a whole, but now we have the position where the big wholesalers are cutting up the small bottle stores and the hotels with off-sales licences. I think that this is something that cannot be deprecated strongly enough. We expect the hotels to provide us with good service at a reasonable tariff and we know full well that their profits come from the sale of liquor to a large extent Yet on the other hand we are now going to allow the bigger wholesalers and the manufacturers to undercut them.</p>

<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, like my hon. friend here I am also a teetotaller but in a different way. I am totally against tea! I must admit, Sir, that it was most peculiar to see the hon. Senator Crook and the hon. the Minister agree today. There is a very strange atmosphere in the House today. However, one can understand it The hon. Senator Crook is a member of the Side-bar; the hon. the Minister is a member of the Bar and I claim to be a proud and very old member of the Standing Bar! So I think I can speak with some authority on the subject of the freer distribution of liquor.</p>
<p>I want to tell my hon. friend, the hon. Senator Winchester, that I am also opposed to this Bill but he nearly convinced me to vote in favour of it.</p>
<p>*I think in the first place we are dealing with the hope that is cherished that if supermarkets and grocers are allowed to distribute wine freely, there will be an increased consumption of wine. I wonder if that has really been tested? What steps have been taken to ascertain whether that is really the case? Does the average family not spend a limited amount per month or per year on this luxury? I think that the average family can only spend a limited amount of money per week or per month on liquor. That is why it does not matter whether or not grocers are allowed to sell wine because I am not so sure that it will result in increased purchases of wine.</p>
<p>If my supposition is correct, I have a further objection. Constructing a hotel today is a very expensive process. The ordinary hotel owner will tell you that his revenue to cover his debts and enable him to comply with the requirements of the hotel industry, does not come from meals or accommodation but from the takings from his off-sales. If the concession to grocers to enter this field does not bring about a large increase in the sale of wine&#x2014;it may result in a limited increase but perhaps sales will remain static&#x2014;I think we will be doing the hotel industry an injustice. We will be taking from them a way of life to which, I think, they are entitled, and for which&#x2014;here the hon. the Minister will agree with me&#x2014;they have to qualify because they can attain a certain status in this respect One can dig up examples from the past with reference to this matter which can be used as an illustration. I remember, for instance, that large supermarkets were permitted at the time to sell certain medicines and other substances which previously were only sold by chemists, and the effect this had on chemists. Any chemist will tell you at once that he cannot make a living purely from making up prescriptions, and that he has to sell other medicines and articles to balance his books and cover his costs. Pharmacists were dealt a heavy blow as a result of the fact that the supermarkets were granted that concession.</p>
<p>Sir, if we are now going to allow the supermarkets to sell wine as well, hotels, for instance, should also be allowed to sell red meat These days even if a hotel has the finest cold-rooms and facilities, the hotel proprietor cannot get a meat licence on those premises and at the same hotel. He is prohibited from doing so.</p>

Of course, the hon. Senator is speaking from experience and I agree with him. My experience has been precisely the same.</p>
<p>We are dealing here with a system of free enterprise and I shall vote against this Bill because I see it as a direct intrusion upon the rights of our hotel industry, which I think has an important role to play in South Africa, not only in the sphere of accommodating our own people but also the large number of tourists we are getting now and expect in the future. I do not think that we should make any inroads into the methods they use to make a living.</p>

<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I find myself in the peculiar position of disagreeing with the hon. Senator Swanepoel, who is my Deputy Whip. The hon. Senator Swanepoel says that he believes in the free enterprise system and so he will vote against this Bill. I believe in the free enterprise system so I will vote for the Bill. I believe that anything that makes for freer competition or open competition in any sphere at all is to be welcomed. I am a straight free enterprise man who believes that the discipline of the market place is the system which will rectify the ills of modern economies. That is my belief. I see this Bill as it stands as an extension of the free enterprise system. I am impressed by the fact that many hotels have built up a genuine vested interest, that they have given service to the public and that they give service of a high standard. I am impressed by this. I am indeed. However, I think in the long run those very hotels which give good service will not be worried by a Bill of this sort, because they will hold up their heads in any sort of competition. If they do not, it is just too bad, but I am a free enterprise man and that is why I will vote for this Bill.</p>
<p>May I say that there is one clause which worries me, not because of the principle of the clause, but because&#x2014;and I should like the hon. the Minister to give me his assurance or reassurance on this matter&#x2014;it may interfere with local option. I raise this matter on behalf of the M.P. for Simonstown. He came to see me this afternoon and said that he had been away during the debate in the Other Place and that he would like the matter to be raised here. He is a friend of mine, and I am therefore raising the matter; not only for that reason but because I also believe in local option, as he does.</p>
<p>In the Simonstown area we have the local authority area of Fish Hoek. Fish Hoek&#x2019;s title deeds prohibit the sale of liquor through licensed premises in the Fish Hoek area. Not very long ago there was a referendum by the municipal voters of Fish Hoek and they clearly indicated that they wanted to retain the present situation. That does not mean that they do not go to Muizenberg or Kommetjie to buy their liquor. They do that.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>They do not want licensed premises of any sort in the Fish Hoek area. That is a proper local option; it has been expressed properly and it would be a pity if it were interfered with until the people themselves ask for licensed outlets for liquor there.</p>
<p>Clause 5 states&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">a grocer&#x2019;s wine licence, in respect of premises upon which any person lawfully carries on the business of a general dealer and any other business specially authorized by the competent authority &#x2026;</block>
<p>The &#x201C;competent authority&#x201D; is the licensing board. It is not the Fish Hoek municipality. It used to read &#x201C;the licensee&#x201D; but in Fish Hoek there were no licensees. Now, of course, if a grocer, duly authorized as a general dealer, can sell liquor, it may be in contravention of the local authority&#x2019;s option backed by the people in Fish Hoek. I would like the hon. the Minister to have a look into this matter because it is of great importance.</p>
<p>I said earlier that I believed in the free enterprise system but I also believe in local option. I would like the hon. the Minister to have a look at the question of a place like Fish Hoek where the people do not want licensees. They may find now that grocers&#x2019; shops are selling wine in direct conflict with their expressed wishes over the years.</p>
<p>I should like now to say a few words to the hon. Senator Winchester and should like to do so in a very friendly way. That hon. Senator must not delude himself that the restriction on liquor outlets and the hours of liquor sales, does anything to avoid drunkenness. I have been in Australia. There they have a system where the bars are shut, in some states at seven o&#x2019;clock and in others at eight o&#x2019;clock. People go there after work&#x2014; before they have had anything to eat&#x2014;and they drink themselves silly. [Interjections.] A dozen glasses in front of them are filled up. Then they go home and are of no use to their wives, children or anybody else. This is so because there is this fairly stupid restriction on bar hours.</p>
<p>Perhaps the hon. Senator Winchester is too young to remember this&#x2014;I seldom pay compliments but I pay him that compliment&#x2014;but I should like to remind him of the years of prohibition in the USA when there were the worst possible evils because of the prohibition of liquor. It is a free enterprise system and people must be allowed to go to hell in their own way. The answer is not to restrict liquor sales or the hours during which liquor may be sold. The answer is to educate your people so that they do not abuse liquor. The history of the prohibition years in the USA was a record of gangsterism, of bath-tub liquor in which they used wood alcohol which caused people to go blind &#x2026; Senator P. H. S. VAN ZIJL: Al Capone.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, Al Capone, and company. The whole thing was an experiment in disaster if one can express it in that way. And very wisely prohibition was lifted.</p>
<p>The answer is to educate the people in the non-abuse of liquor and not to say to them: You can only drink until eight o&#x2019;clock. If one tells the non-educated human being who abuses liquor that he can only drink until eight o&#x2019;clock, he will drink twice as much before eight o&#x2019;clock than he normally would have done in the course of an evening.</p>
<p>I am a free enterprise man and I will vote for this Bill, but I would like the hon. the Minister to express an opinion in regard to the question of Fish Hoek.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-justice">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, if hon. gentlemen have no objection, I shall try to reply in the first instance to the last question raised by the hon. Senator Horak. I am of the opinion that as the provision reads at present&#x2014;I refer the hon. Senator to clause 8&#x2014;it is not possible to grant a licence in an area where a licence may not be issued. That is my legal opinion, on the face of it. The point which the hon. Senator raised, however, is one I shall put to the law advisers and make doubly sure as far as this point is concerned.</p>
<p>I want to tell the hon. Senator Bozas that he need not worry about hotels. He need not worry about the wholesale producers either because in terms of the Act the wholesale producer cannot obtain this licence as he is disqualified. The hotel off-sales, on the other hand, is now entitled for the first time to bargain for a wine-counter in a grocer&#x2019;s shop. Let me tell hon. Senators at once that the whole idea of this piece of legislation is really to prevent the wholesale producers dominating the whole retail market. That has already been established to give ordinary licence holders&#x2014;the old &#x201C;bottle licensee&#x201D;&#x2014;a chance to make a living by bargaining for a wine-counter in a grocer&#x2019;s shop.</p>
<p>Over the course of years&#x2014;and I mentioned this in my Second Reading speech&#x2014;we granted a limited number of grocers&#x2019; licences. That automatically answers the points raised by the hon. Senator Swanepoel. The grocers&#x2019; shops have licences, they can apply for them, but only in very exceptional cases have we granted grocers&#x2019; licences. The idea now is to give them the right to make application, in which case such an application would succeed, depending of course on its merits. But the main idea behind this legislation is really to give the small shopkeeper a chance to make a living as well as the hotel off-sales.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I want to tell the hon. Senator Winchester that I have great sympathy with the people he represents and with his attitude. I myself believe that we should not allow liquor to be too freely available, and that is why we have the Act.</p>
<p>†This is a temperance Act. The whole Act itself is restrictive to the sale of liquor. That is why the hon. Senator can say to me: &#x201C;But you have already passed 16 amendments, making it easier to distribute liquor.&#x201D; That is so, because the whole Act is a restrictive Act against the sale of liquor. It was introduced in 1928 as a result of pressure by churches and temperance societies to which we have accorded every respect in this Act.</p>

<p>The whole idea behind the Liquor Act is to cater for the reasonable requirements of reasonable drinkers. We are against the other social evils which flow from this. Even the big liquor dealers, for instance, the KWV and others, spend enormous sums of money in combating alcoholism because alcoholism is not a good advertisement for liquor. When one constantly comes up against drunk people, it is a bad advertisement for liquor and the liquor dealers realize this. They would like to have wine served with meals and that is why they are pleased that wine will now be sold in grocers&#x2019; shops. The housewife can now do her shopping and together with her groceries she can also buy a bottle of wine. Then she goes home and the family drinks a glass of wine with their food. That is the right way to use wine and we want to encourage it.</p>
<p>I can give the hon. Senator the assurance that we are on the side of people who use liquor in moderation. We shall not grant liquor licences holus bolus and make the purchase of liquor too easy. The granting of licences will still be controlled by the Liquor Board and in such a way that only licences necessary to meet the reasonable requirements of the public will be granted.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Salary increases for public servants have just been announced. As hon. Senators know, these have also led to an increase in the salaries of members of Parliament. In addition, provision has been made for improved pension benefits in the Parliamentary Service and Administrators&#x2019; Pensions Amendment Bill. It is desirable, therefore, that attention should also be given to the position of judges.</p>
<p>This may be an appropriate moment to remind hon. members of this House of the important part played by the judiciary in our community and the necessity for integrity and incorruptibility in our judges. The administration of justice in this country is above suspicion today and is an aspect of our society which not even the often prejudiced outside world can criticize with any justification. Therefore it is essential that we ensure that the conditions of service of those who serve on our Bench are such that the best available people may be attracted to it.</p>
<p>My colleague, the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, is presently piloting through a Bill in terms of which the non-taxable allowance payable in terms of section 1 of the Judges&#x2019; Remuneration Act, 1978, will also be taken into consideration in calculating the pensions of judges. The amendment proposed in clause 1 of this Bill is consequential upon that proposed provision.</p>
<p>Judges are often absent from their head-quarters in the performance of their duties and then have to stay at hotels. Hotel tariffs differ drastically depending on the grading of the hotel and the town or city in which it is situated. Therefore it is found that the prescribed scales of compensation for the cost of accommodation are sometimes inadequate. It is proposed that the regulation dealing with this aspect be amended to enable judges to claim their actual expenses in such cases. It has been found, however, that the enabling provision contained in section 2 of the Act is not wide enough to provide for such amendment. This is being rectified in clause 2.</p>
<p>We regularly make use of the services of acting judges, for example, where judges are on long leave or serving on commissions of inquiry. Service as acting judge also provides useful experience, of course, for anyone who is later appointed as a judge. However, I am finding it more and more difficult to obtain the services of suitable advocates for this purpose.</p>

<p>Advocates make too much money.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>It is repeatedly advanced that the salary does not provide for the expenses which acting judges are forced to incur in order to maintain their practices as advocates. It must be remembered that acting judges receive the same salary as judges, but do not share in other benefits, such as a medical aid scheme. Additional compensation to acting judges to cover expenses incurred in order to maintain their practices therefore appears to be desirable. A provision enabling such an allowance to be prescribed by regulation is therefore proposed in terms of clause 2.</p>
<p>In clause 3, a salary increase of 12% is proposed for judges and acting judges. Unfortunately, the Bill omits to indicate that the increase shall take effect from 1 April 1979. An amendment in this regard will be moved at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, naturally I do not intend to oppose this clause, but there is one point on which I should like some information from the hon. the Minister. Perhaps he could explain to me why&#x2014;and I am probably jumping the gun here&#x2014;police are going to be allowed to serve outside the borders of the Republic of South Africa. I know that we live in unusual times, and I know that already, in terms of the Bill, the police will be able to cross the border within limitations. Nobody has any quarrel with that concept whatsoever, but I would like to ask the hon. the Minister this question: Where does he foresee that our police could serve? When one talks about &#x201C;outside the Republic of South Africa&#x201D; one envisages them being able to serve anywhere in the world. I know that this is perhaps far-fetched but this is the way it is going to read. This is a police force; it is not a military force, and the police are specially trained in police duties and in police functions. I can tell the hon. the Minister&#x2014;he probably knows it already&#x2014;that many policemen do in fact get somewhat irritated and a little annoyed when they are put on duties which are not strictly police duties. They do not like standing guard, for instance; they do not consider this a police function. Certainly, if I joined the Police Force, I would like to think that I was involved in police work. I cannot conceive therefore that the police should serve outside the borders of South Africa. It is true that during the war we had a very efficient and very famous Police Brigade, but they served as volunteers when South Africa was at war. This is not a question of volunteering.</p>
<p>If the hon. the Minister tells me that the purpose of this is so that he can send policemen to London or anywhere else to bring somebody back, I would say that is fair enough; if that is the only way in which it can be done, naturally I would have no objection. But I do have the feeling that I would like to see the Police Force employed in strictly police duties, and I would be very interested to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation as to why he wants this particular power. As I say, during the war this sort of work was done by volunteers, and I have no objection to that.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-police">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senator has put a completely fair question to me. Firstly, while the Police Force are in the process of chasing terrorists they might well cross the borders of the Republic, even if for only a very short distance and, if they are injured there, all sorts of juridical questions arise. Policemen are entitled at all times to be covered by our laws and their regulations and therefore we must in the first instance make provision that they can operate outside South Africa.</p>
<p>But there is a second important point which I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. gentleman. That is that Parliament will probably prorogue towards the end of June, and the whole world, including the UN, expects South West Africa to become independent before the end of the year, that is, before Parliament meets again. I can tell hon. Senators that South West Africa is still not in a position to maintain its own police force and it will be necessary for us, if they become independent and they ask South Africa to help with the policing of South West Africa, to agree to do so. Because of our former mandate and our relations with South West Africa I cannot see that we shall refuse to do this. In those circumstances I must again cover the South African policeman so that he can do police work outside South Africa should that country become independent.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, purely out of curiosity&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister need not answer if he feels it is not in the national interest to do so&#x2014;I should like to put a question to the hon. the Minister. Of course, I support this clause whole-heartedly. I actually served in the same division as the Police Brigade in the last war and they were magnificent soldiers. The fact that they were captured at Tobruk was not their fault. Before that they had conquered Bardia and were at Hellfaya Pass. But we did have a police presence in Rhodesia not very long ago. It was a few years back, and I am not sure under what legal authority the Minister had them there. If the hon. the Minister does not want to reply he need not.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I must be quite honest; I will have to go into the matter. If the hon. Senator wants a reply to that I will first have to find out what the position was. I am certain we did have some authority. We would have had to have the authority.</p>

<p>Clause 9:</p>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to take this opportunity to repeat some of the arguments that I put to the hon. the Minister and to which, I submit, he gave no reply. He did reply to one or two of the arguments I put but I think he will admit that the major portion of his speech was devoted to my hon. colleague in another party, the hon. Senator Winchester. I would like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply to the arguments that I put.</p>
<p>Before I get on to that, Sir, I wish to mention one point that the hon. the Minister made and about which I was somewhat put out because I think it was unfair to me. The hon. the Minister said the following in the course of his speech&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The point that I want to make&#x2014;and I think the hon. Senator will grant me that&#x2014;is that I am quite prepared to accept that there may be black sheep in the police. But I think there must be black sheep in probably every organization in the country.</block>
<p>I then interjected&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">So I said.</block>
<p>I do feel that this is a matter of importance because anybody reading the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech could come to the conclusion that I had launched a heavy and unfair attack upon the police <i>per</i> <i>se</i>, which was not the position at all, of course. I wish to read from my speech to indicate that I did not do so. I said this&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">There are black sheep in the police the same as there are in all callings. There are black sheep in my calling as well as the calling of every gentleman in this House. (And I might interpolate here, Sir, as also in the calling of the hon. the Minister himself!) I am not attacking the police when I say so, Sir. It is obvious that I am not doing that and I would not like it to be said that I am. It is desirable that the black sheep, and I am talking about the black sheep that are in the Police Force, should be deterred by fear of exposure and by who else but the Press.</block>
<p>I wanted to make that point clear, because I felt rather sore about it.</p>
<p>I want now to pass on to the arguments which I adduced and to which I suggest the hon. the Minister has not replied. I said that the police were receiving special protection and that the police were already protected by the courts of the land, and I specifically referred to the law of defamation. The police are in no better position than anybody else in this country as far as defamation is concerned. My submission is that if the Press or anybody else tells untruths or lies about or slanders the police, then the police have the same recourse that I and everybody else have, i.e. recourse to the courts of the land. This is a very important point because I went on to say that there is no special provision for members of the Public Service or for anybody else so why then is it necessary to have special protection for the police?</p>
<p>I then dealt with the question of the Press Council. The hon. the Minister did to a certain extent reply on the question of the Press Council. I will not read that portion of his speech which is devoted thereto, but I will summarize it if I may. The hon. the Minister, as I understood him&#x2014;I have his speech here&#x2014;pointed out that the Press Council was not interested in individual journalists. The Press Council was interested in untruths, misleading statements and the like published by different journals, newspapers and so forth. It followed therefore that an irresponsible journalist against whom this Bill is said to be aimed, could make statements that were injurious to the police, quite irresponsibly and quite untruthfully. He could then appeal to his editor and in that regard the Press Council was no real protection to the police <i>per</i> <i>se.</i> In my submission that argument is ill-founded because the sanction that is provided in order to protect the police and everybody else against this type of journalism&#x2014;against which the Bill is apparently directed, is an enormous sanction&#x2014;no less than R10 000 fine. I find it hard to believe that when a journalist has been irresponsible he would find favour in the eyes of his editor if he published a gross untruth and the paper was punished as it should be to the full extent that the Press Council is competent to do, which is a R10 000 fine. I was not impressed with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply in that regard and I might mention that I do not think that Dr. De Klerk, the Editor-in-Chief of <i>Die Transvaler</i>, would be impressed either. That was the point that he made very strongly in his attack upon this Bill.</p>
<p>In my argument I equated the provisions of clause 9 of this Bill with a similar provision in the Prisons Act. In my submission that is the most powerful argument that can be used against this Bill. There is none more powerful. I should like to refer to what the hon. the Minister had to say in that regard. He did in fact treat of the matter. Again I submit that his arguments do not hold water. They are not sound. I read from a copy of his speech where he said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">As far as I am concerned, the Press is quite entitled to write about the misdeeds of any policeman as long as it is the truth. They have to do their jobs to the best of their ability to find out whether it is true. They have to try to verify it. That is all this Bill is about. The Bill puts a very light onus indeed on the Press.</block>
<p>In that context he did not refer directly to the argument that I had advanced but it is referred to by implication. He then went on and dealt with the light onus that he had referred to. It was on that question that I particularly addressed this House.</p>
<p>I should like to deal again with that portion of my argument that I advanced before, because I do not think that it has been answered adequately by the hon. the Minister. I quoted and I wish to quote again, the provision of the Prisons Act which I submit is similar to the provision in clause 9. It states&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Any person who publishes any false information concerning the behaviour or experience in a prison of any prisoner or ex-prisoner or concerning the administration of any prison, knowing the same to be false or without having taken reasonable steps to verify such information, the onus of that reasonable steps were taken to verify such information being upon the accused, shall be quilty of an offence.</block>
<p>Sir, I submitted that that particular section of the Prisons Act, is almost identical in sense&#x2014;although not in words&#x2014;as the operative passage in clause 9 of the Bill before us. The operative passage in the Prisons Act reads as follows, Sir&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; without taking reasonable steps to verify such information &#x2026;</block>
<p>The hon. the Minister says a very light onus is then upon the accused person to discharge that he took &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; without having reasonable grounds &#x2026; for believing that that statement is true &#x2026;</block>
<p>Here again the onus rests upon the accused.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Chief Whip, Sir. [Interjections.] I believe that the evidence that will have to be adduced by the accused person in order to discharge that onus, is practically the same in both cases. In the case of the Prisons Act it states&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; without taking reasonable steps to verify such information &#x2026;</block>
<p>Sir, strangely enough, the hon. the Minister uses those very words in his argument. He says this is a light onus. The hon. the Minister says this, Sir&#x2014;I have already read it out but will read it again&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">As far as I am concerned the Press is quite entitled to write about the misdeeds of any policeman, as long as it is the truth. They have to do their jobs to the best of their ability to find out whether it is true.</block>
<p>Now I come to the operative words&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">They have to try to verify it.</block>
<p>Those words have the same sense, Sir, as those used in the Prisons Act.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, what has been the effect of those words? The effect has been that for 10 long years there has been no report regarding misdeeds and things that are wrong in prisons. The reason is because the courts found in a test case that the action that had been taken by an offending editor who had been charged in terms of the relevant section in the Prisons Act, had not been sufficient. What did he do?</p>

<p>Yes, I do. The very reason that I accept the court as correct is because it creates a formula whereby it is impossible&#x2014;in my submission&#x2014;for the Press to publish articles of this nature. I do accept that the court is right I also accept that the editor on that occasion took all these little steps. What did he do, Sir? He got affidavits from the people who gave him information. He got affidavits from all of them except one. The whole lot were in fact cross-examined &#x2026;</p>

The whole of the article was not untrue but certain of the allegations that had been made were untrue with the result that the editor was found guilty. Sir, when one considers the drastic penalties involved in this provision, i.e. R10 000 or 5 years&#x2019; imprisonment&#x2014;one feels that this will deter any editor from daring to publish anything of the nature regarding &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, that hon. Senator is conducting a running commentary. I wish he would get up and make a speech because he is perfectly entitled to do so. Nothing prevents him from doing so.</p>
<p>I maintain that the object of this Bill is, in fact, to bring about the same situation as had been brought about as result of a similar provision in the Prisons Act, and that is to prevent there being any disclosure of misdeeds on the part of black sheep in the police. That is the main reason why we object to this Bill. It is the main reason why the Afrikaans-language Press in unison has objected to this Bill. It is the main reason why every English-language paper in the country has objected to this Bill, because, in my submission, it will be impossible for misdeeds that have been perpetrated by black sheep in the police to be disclosed. As far as the prisons are concerned, this has been impossible for ten years and therefore I am perfectly justified in making this allegation. And I say here and now, Sir, that if this Bill had been law when Nkane died in the Ngwelezane Hospital in Empangeni, that case would never have seen the light of day. There would have been no prosecution in that case. The two White and one Black policemen who were sent to gaol for 12 years on charges of inhuman and barbarous treatment, would never have been sentenced. Sir, it is the black sheep in the police that bring the name of the whole Police Force into disrepute. The Police Force in this country has probably in its ranks some of the finest police in the world, and yet here we have a Bill being introduced and for what purpose? The hon. the Minister has not advanced any reasons at all why the Press should be gagged in this respect. And gagged they will be because of the formula that I have mentioned.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I feel very strongly about this, and I am not the only one who feels this way. The hon. the Minister made a snide remark about me when I referred to Adv. De Villiers. In a speech which Adv. De Villiers made in Johannesburg shortly before the hon. the Minister commenced piloting this Bill through the House, said that the effect of this Bill would be to draw a veil over the activities of the police.</p>

<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>I hope he will follow me and reply to this argument. Two editors of daily national newspapers in this country, papers that I think nobody will deny, put the case of the NP because they are Nationalist papers, namely the editor of <i>Die Transvaler</i>, Dr. De Klerk, and the editor of <i>Die Burger</i>, both made the same point. They said that one of the results of this Bill will be that in the event of prosecution being commenced against any editor because of an infringement of this particular clause, the temptation will be there to disclose the sources of information in order to defend themselves. And would I blame them, Sir? Would I blame them when there is this vicious penalty of R10 000 or five years&#x2019; imprisonment or both&#x2014;R10 000 and five years&#x2019; imprisonment&#x2014;if they disclose the sources of information? As a good pressman, will the hon. Senator Van Schoor say that he desires that the sources of information in a democratic country which are given to the Press should be disclosed? Has he ever done that? I do not believe for one minute that he has, Sir. I do not believe for one minute that he can adduce any arguments to satisfy Dr. De Klerk or the editor of <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i> that it is justifiable.</p>
<p>I would like to hear him on this point, Sir. He is a good pressman; he is an exceedingly good pressman. He has been the editor of a very famous Nationalist newspaper in this country. Can he deny that he would have that temptation too if he were faced with five years&#x2019; imprisonment together with a fine of R5 000 or R10 000? He will not deny that Can he deny that in every democratic country it is looked upon as a sacrosanct convention that editors of newspapers will not divulge, nor will journalists, the source of their information. I think that the harm a Bill of this nature will do to this country is something the hon. Senator Van Schoor cannot be proud of.</p>
<p>That argument was not entertained or replied to by the hon. the Minister, and another argument I put to him was not replied to either. It should interest every hon. Senator on that side of the House, because in season and out we hear this argument adduced. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. M. VAN SCHOOR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, it is with great pleasure that I rise to reply to the allegations made by the hon. Senator Crook.</p>
<p>†In the first place, I must say that I bow to the superior knowledge of the law of the hon. Senator Crook, but I simply refuse to bow to his ignorance of press procedure. I explained at the Second Reading that in the first place the relations between the Press and the police have always been of the highest order, and this is essential for the journalistic practice. We have established a system of co-operation which opens all avenues to scenes of crime to the Press. The hon. Senator Crook does not know journalistic practice and I can tell him that prior to clause 9 in this new Bill I was almost imprisoned for being responsible for certain statements and news reports in my newspaper. There was the classic case where I almost landed in gaol because my staff reported that there was a tremendous amount of diamond smuggling going on through Jan Smuts. The police came to me quite fairly, and what could I say? They said: &#x201C;If you have knowledge of the commission of any crime, then you are under an obligation to submit that evidence to the police.&#x201D; Is that not correct? Should I not have to submit it? If my paper makes a report without having it verified, and I publish it as a sensational report, that there is diamond smuggling taking place through Jan Smuts, where should I be if I refuse to give my information to the police? What is the hon. Senator&#x2019;s objection? He is a man of law. Would he defend me under those circumstances?</p>
<p>There is another point which the hon. Senator loses sight of. Clause 9 says specifically that the publication of untrue material is prohibited. Does he defend the freedom to publish untrue material? Secondly, as I explained in my speech yesterday, if one acts on the old basis of the ethics of journalism, that one may publish anything believing it to be true, then I say that shifts the onus of proof for such statements to the man who makes that statement and the State does not carry that responsibility.</p>
<p>If a newspaper chooses to publish a report which it is not prepared to defend, but publishes it on the grounds of believing it to be true, then surely that newspaperman is under an obligation to prove that it is true. I cannot understand why the hon. Senator Crook is so hot and bothered about clause 9. It is simple, we have lived with this procedure. It is just new phraseology, but we have lived with it for donkey&#x2019;s years. If a newspaper publishes stories, such as the case I know so well which he mentioned here where statements by ex-prisoners were published, I say first of all he must know what types he is dealing with. When the court found there were no reasonable grounds for believing the statements of these ex-prisoners, does the hon. Senator Crook, as a legal man, really have the impertinence to stand up and question the judgment of the court? No, Mr. Chairman, I say this clause is perfectly justified and there is nothing wrong with it, and I cannot see why the hon. Senator Crook does not go to a medical man to have his blood pressure taken.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can give the hon. Senator the arguments, but I cannot give him the intelligence to understand them; that is my problem. You see, Sir, I said over and over again, several times that the judgment of the court was the correct one, but the formula is such that it has proved impossible for the press to publish any statements at all regarding prisons. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Order! Hon. Senators must give the hon. Senator Crook an opportunity to make his speech.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Thank you, Sir. I do not know if the hon. Senator believes that there are a lot of angels looking after prisoners, or if he believes that there are no misdeeds in prisons. I do not know if he believes that everything that is done there is done lawfully. I do not know if he believes that there are no conditions which should be exposed because they are wrong in the prisons. If he does I take a very poor view of his intelligence. They are human beings the same as we are human beings, and the same as the warders are. But whether the reports are made by warders or whether they are made by prisoners does not matter; the position is such that it is almost impossible with this formula to satisfy a court of law that they have carried out the requirements of the formula. It has proved impossible for ten years. The hon. Senator Van Schoor referred to a report of a crime concerning diamonds, and he had to give the information. Of course, if he knows that the illegal sale of diamonds is taking place and he wants to prevent it continuing, he must give that information. That is not what is being discussed here.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#schoor">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. M. VAN SCHOOR</person>:</from>
<p>That is why this principle was abolished.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>He refers to the question of untrue material. That is the very thing that is objectionable in so far as the provision in the Prisons Act is concerned. It does not matter how much material is true and how much is untrue; there is a bar to all publication under that Act.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, I shall continue with the speech I was making. The other argument I put to the hon. the Minister which he did not reply to&#x2014;which in my submission is a good argument a very good argument&#x2014;was one which was put up by the Nationalist Press. I have an idea it came from <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i>, though for the moment I cannot be certain. In a leading article the newspaper said that the object of the hon. the Minister was to safeguard the police, but in effect the object would never be carried out for the simple reason that this type of legislation for protecting the police raises a suspicion in the minds of the public that there is something going on, that the hon. the Minister is endeavouring to cover up. As it was said in <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i> in a leading article it will be counter-productive. And for that reason, and the many other reasons that have been given why this Bill is undesirable, I suggest that the hon. the Minister should drop the Bill.</p>
<p>I raised certain other arguments which I do not intend referring to again, but the final matter that I referred to concerned the South African Association of Law Societies. Apparently representations were made by the Association to the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Minister undertook to consider and to reply to those representations. All I asked the hon. the Minister was to let us know what those representations were and to advise us of his reply to them.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#rensburg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I am afraid the hon. Senator Crook has completely lost sight of the serious offence of false evidence and the enormous consequences which this entails. Only two sections of the old Criminal Procedure Act have been retained. One of the sections of that Act, No. 56 of 1955 that has been retained is section 319(3) under the heading: &#x201C;Charges resulting from the giving of false evidence.&#x201D; Section 319(3) provides clearly that if a person makes two conflicting statements&#x2014;it does not matter what they concern&#x2014;they are regarded as false. If the State prosecutes him because of the false statements, it is not necessary for the State to prove which one is not true. If the State proves that a person made two conflicting statements, that person is criminally liable even if only something very petty is at stake. That is how seriously our law regards false statements.</p>
<p>In my view a court would give very serious consideration to the clause before us before anybody was punished. I mentioned this during the Second Reading debate, but I want to repeat what I said in reply to the arguments of the hon. Senator Crook. Firstly, it must be proved that it is an untruth. Even if the statement has not been made under oath, it remains a fact that it has been printed and published, and this is a far more serious offence in my view than when somebody makes it under oath. Secondly, it must be proved that an untruth has been published. Thirdly, the State will have to prove that it relates to any action by the Police Force or a section of the Police Force. It must concern the actions of the Police Force in those particular circumstances. Fourthly, it must relate to the execution of a policeman&#x2019;s functions as a member of the Police Force. I think these are four cardinal points which the State must prove before there can be a conviction. Fifthly&#x2014;and here the onus is on the accused&#x2014;a person must have published an untruth relating to the actions of the Police Force without having reasonable grounds for assuming the statement to be untrue. In that case the onus rests on the accused. We in the legal profession, of course, do not care much for the shifting of the onus of proof. But in this case an enormously wide field is covered. If the Press wishes to publish a certain report now, it is the easiest thing in the world&#x2014;-the hon. Minister also referred to this&#x2014;for them first to ascertain what the actual positon is. If the Press has taken reasonable steps to ascertain what the exact position is, then it will have complied with the fifth requirement to a large extent.</p>
<p>I say again that the hon. Opposition in this case is losing sight of the real meaning of a false statement. When a statement is false, is committed to writing and published, it does enormous damage.</p>
<p>In his speech the hon. Senator Crook referred to the protection of the police. But it is not just the police who are being protected here, Sir. The State is protected and every citizen of the State, including the hon. Senator Crook and myself, is protected here. We are protected against false statements, statements made without proper consideration, one could almost say deliberately. Such statements could threaten his position and my position. It is a fair requirement, Mr. Chairman, to ask the Press to make proper inquiry before they publish and bruit abroad something which concerns such an important section of our national life, our State set-up, viz. the Police Force. How often are we not attacked by people overseas regarding false statements which are made and false reports which are spread?</p>
<p>We hear a lot about the Biko incident and the other case to which the hon. Senator Crook refers so often. But has anything ever been said about the almost 300 people in Iran who have died at the hands of firing squads? All we are doing here is to prohibit false rumours being spread abroad, and then we get this sort of objection which the hon. Senator has raised. I say again it is not only the police we want to protect. Perhaps the police are protected to a lesser extent, but it is the protection of the State and every citizen, including hon. Senators in this House, which is at stake.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, there are a number of matters I intend to deal with. First of all I want to confirm that I have agreed to allow the hon. the Minister to take all the remaining stages of this Bill for the very good reason that he has advanced, namely, that he has to open a police station tomorrow at Newcastle. My only regret, Sir, is that the hon. the Minister does not do more of that and introduce fewer of the sort of Bill that we have before us this afternoon. I would be with him one hundred per cent if he did that.</p>
<p>I must also commiserate with the hon. the Minister on having missed out as Administrator of the Transvaal. Perhaps he may get Natal when that comes up! Otherwise he could be made Administrator of kwaZulu. I feel sorry for the Zulus if that were to happen!</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister launched a personal attack on me yesterday. I have no objection to that I attacked him and he is fully entitled to return the compliment. I did find it strange though when he called me a fool because I thought then that he should easily understand my arguments. If I am a fool then all the hon. Senators on the other side should understand me very well because we are all in the same camp. Be that as it may, Sir, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I do not believe he has as yet adequately answered the questions put to him by the hon. Senator Crook. Besides that, I should like to deal with one or two other points.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Rensburg who has just resumed his seat talked about the harm done overseas by false statements, but harm is also done overseas by correct statements. The statement by the hon. the Minister a few years ago in reference to Biko when he said that it left him cold, is an example. That was not a false statement I have not heard the hon. the Minister say that that was false. He was correctly reported. He explained that in Afrikaans it did not quite mean the same&#x2014; that it was not as callous as it was in English. Nevertheless, that is how it was reported.</p>
<p>That was not a false statement. It is the true statements that probably does more harm to South Africa overseas than the false ones.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Schoor is the ex-editor of <i>Die</i> <i>Vaderland</i>, the famous NP-supporting newspaper, and I want to say to him that not very long ago that newspaper published a story about myself which was a downright and deliberate lie.</p>
</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senator Van Schoor was dealing with newspapers and the problems of their editors in regard to this particular matter. And I am replying to him on this particular point, the problem of editors. Here is a question where the newspaper of which he was editor&#x2014;I do not say he was editor at the time, I believe he left the year before this actually happened&#x2014;had to publish an apology. This newspaper published a report that I held a British passport, which was a lie, and about which they never bothered to &#x2019;phone me to check the story out. If they had phoned that would have been the end of the matter and they would never have published it. All newspapers can and do make mistakes, as I have said before. The hon. the Minister is a classic example of the sort of thing that could happen. I now want to deal with that directly. The hon. the Minister was at great pains to explain the whole Biko matter from his point of view yesterday. He objected to some of the words I used, such as &#x201C;death from starvation&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister said he never said that. I believe that the hon. the Minister is merely playing with words when he makes that statement, because I have before me various quotations in that particular regard. One of the headlines reads: &#x201C;Biko died after hunger strike.&#x201D; I said death from starvation perhaps &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, in connection with the Police Force, Mr. Chairman, whether it is true or false.

What is being given to the newspapers may in fact ultimately not tie up with the facts when they are finally known.

<p>The other question is whether the police always act in the proper manner. As the hon. Senator Crook said, there are a few black sheep in every institution and there are a few in the Police Force.

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, let me then put this to the hon. the Minister. What is this whole clause about? It is a question of whether the report is true or false.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#chairman">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>
<p>In terms of the Police Act?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>In terms of the Police Act I am only dealing with the police, Mr. Chairman. I would never deal with anything else, as you know. I am dealing with this clause of the Bill and I am dealing with the police. The essence of this clause is that the reporter must report the truth, or prove it to be the truth. I am saying to the hon. the Minister that this is not always possible. There is a difference between what can be reported by a responsible newspaper reporter as regards what he says and believes to be the truth and what ultimately turns out to be the truth. I am saying that the hon. the Minister is well aware of that particular point.</p>
<p>The other issue in this regard&#x2014;and this is where the hon. Senator Crook is perfectly correct, and I will just very quickly and in passing mention the Prisons Act&#x2014;is that because of the Prisons Act there has not been a report in regard to prisons for approximately ten years. The hon. the Minister tackled me on this and said that I was insinuating that everything in the prisons was wrong. I never said anything of the sort. I said I do not know whether it is right or wrong, because the hon. the Minister, in terms of the Prisons Act and also in terms of this Act, implies that no news is going to be good news. That has never been the case anywhere in the world since the time of</p>
<p>Adam and Eve. That is why I say in regard to the Prisons Act that that is how it fits in here, because if we do not hear anything &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<block name="quote">The point that I want to make, and I think the hon. Senator will grant me that, is that I am quite prepared to accept that there maybe black sheep in the police, but I think there must be black sheep in probably every organization in the country.</block>

<p>So I said.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I accept that, Mr. Chairman. I am not arguing with the hon. Senator on that point. He made the point and I reiterated that point, because I was getting to another point which I put to him, viz. that if there are black shep in every organization, it is a fair assumption to make that there would also be black sheep in the Press. My argument was based on the fact that if that was correct, which the hon. Senator conceded was correct, then this sort of Bill is necessary for the black sheep in the Press. I made the statement that as far as I was concerned there are people in the Press who will ignore this Bill because they are entitled to ignore it. They know their job and they do it well. This Bill was primarily introduced to stop the irresponsible pressmen, and not the responsible Press. The responsible Press does not need a Bill like this. If they were all responsible, the Bill would never have come before the House.</p>
<p>*The hon. Senator says we are giving the police complete protection. But how are they protected? As if he possessed all the wisdom in the world, he tells us that they are protected by the laws of libel. In other words, if a policeman is defamed, i.e. if a lie is told about a policeman, that policeman must institute a libel action. The poor policeman must institute a libel against the wealthy Press! Let me tell him now that it is quite impossible to win under those circumstances. The hon. Senator knows as well as I do that this Bill deals with the official actions of policemen, i.e. in their capacity as members of a department. The hon. Senator knows as well as I do that libel cannot be committed against a department.</p>
<p>†One cannot defame the Government. The hon. Senator should know that. One cannot defame a member of the Government.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>One can defame a policeman.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>One can defame an individual policeman, but this Bill has nothing to do with that. This Bill has nothing to do with individual policemen. If the hon. Senator would look at the Bill, he would see that it states &#x201C;the Force or any member of the Force in relation to the performance of his functions as such a member&#x201D;. He is in other words operating as a member of the Police Force which in turn is part of a Government department. Therefore they can never be defamed, Sir. How then can action be taken against them in that capacity? Mr. Chairman, this argument works against the hon. Senator. If it were possible for a policeman, in his official capacity, to take action against the Press, and if it was fair&#x2014;and the hon. Senator Crook says it is fair&#x2014;I want to say that this must be doubly fair because if an untruth is written in regard to a policeman, it gives the Press the opportunity to go to court in order to prove that it is not an untruth or that they had reasonable grounds for believing that it was not an untruth. That is all they have to do.</p>
<p>Sir, if demafation were possible for a policeman and if the courts of law are the answer for the policemen, such courts are the answer for the Press as well. It must work that way, Sir. I cannot see how the hon. Senator can disagree with me. I am sure he does not. If one has a redress to the court one is home and dry. In this case they have a redress to the court, Sir. Therefore, what complaints can there be?</p>
<p>*The hon. Senator said further&#x2014;and I admit this&#x2014;that the individual journalist is not affected by the arrangement we have with the Press Council. That is so, Sir. If the Press write a wrong report about the police, that department goes to the Press Council. But who do the police charge? Not the individual journalist; no provision exists for that in the Press Council regulations. One charges the specific newspaper. What happens then? If judgment is given against the Press, the latter must first put things right. In this connection I just want to tell the hon. Senator that the R10 000 mentioned in the Bill comes from the Press Council regulations. If they regard misrepresentations to be so serious that the Press Council chairman can fine them R10 000, we felt that nobody could object if a court also had the right to fine them R10 000.</p>
<p>Now the following question arises. The hon. Senator says, quite rightly, that he cannot imagine that an editor would like it if the Press Council found against him. He would call in that person and take him to task. But that is not enough, Mr. Chairman. That is my problem. Under the Press Council regulations the individual journalist is only responsible to the editor, it is an internal matter. He might just take him to task for a while and then ask him to join him in a cup of tea. He might also say to him: Look if you do it again you will be discharged. Or he might discharge him. But that is not good enough and that is why this Bill is before you.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator drew an analogy between the Prisons Act and this Bill. I make bold to say that the Prisons Act contains more stringent provisions than this Bill does.</p>
<p>†There is a greater onus in terms of the Prisons Act than that contained in this Bill, Sir. I will tell the hon. Senator why that is so. In terms of the Prisons Act&#x2014;the hon. Senator has read it to us&#x2014;&#x201C;any person who publishes information of any prisoner or the administration of the prison, is guilty of an offence unless they can prove that they had taken reasonable steps to verify it&#x201D;. Is that correct?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Is it not much the same provision?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>No, it is not the same words. This is exactly the point I am trying to make. In the first instance, in terms of the Prisons Act the person has to prove that he has taken reasonable steps that can be objectively checked. He must have taken a series of steps which the court must find reasonable. It is not the case in this Bill, Sir. On the contrary, this Bill provides &#x201C;without having reasonable grounds for believing&#x201D;. In other words, he might not have taken any steps whatsoever in terms of the Prisons Act; no objective series of action. He can simply come to court and may be able to convince them that he had reasonable grounds for believing that it was true and that he had not taken any steps to verify it. However, due to something that happened previously or something he was told by the editor or a policeman, he was genuinely of the belief that the facts were correct. That is all he has to do. And that is a lesser onus, Mr. Chairman, than that contained in the Prisons Act. I think the hon. Senator will agree with me in this regard.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator says that for 10 years there were no reports from prisons. Of course they have had many reports from the prisons. The only difference is that they have only had true reports from the prisons. The reports have never been sensational. I remember that about two years ago we took representatives from the Press through Robben Island. There was a big spiel about it. A lot of photographs was published in the Press. There was a television programme about it. But because it was the truth, the hon. Senator does not even remember it, Sir. I am quite prepared to concede that there might not have been reports about untrue things. But there have been reports about the prisons.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I know that there has been a number of reports over the last year in regard to prison matters in which the prisons actually stimulated the reports.</p>
<p>*The hon. Senator spoke about the Nkane case. There was no cover-up in that case, Sir. I want to challenge the hon. Senator to show me where there was a cover-up in that matter. As far as that matter is concerned, everything was revealed. No information was withheld. The Press could write and did write what they had seen. That was the truth. They will be able to report this sort of case again. The court itself went to the police and the police themselves made inquiries. The policemen concerned were brought to trial and were punished. There was no cover-up. Nkane&#x2019;s case can in no way be mentioned in this connection.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator said <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i> and <i>Die Transvaler</i> were national papers and put the case for the NP. Sir, that is surely nonsense. This is a Government measure; it has run its course. It went to the Cabinet; it was confirmed by the Government; it was dealt with by the caucus. Now it is before Parliament and it is NP policy, Sir. I have nothing against national newspapers which object to this; that is their right. I know a national newspaper need not just senselessly repeat everything the Government does; we do not even expect that from national papers. We expect them to support us during an election campaign. Then we expect them to support us 100%. But we are not looking for slavish followers; we are looking for intelligent supporters. If the paper does not agree with us, it is justified in saying so. I said to a journalist: You are a journalist; if you like the legislation, you need your head read. That is quite obviously the case, Sir. I do not expect them to support it. I expect that behind my back and behind closed doors they will say to one another: Really, it is not unfair; it is fair, but we shall not say so publicly because it will affect our interests. That is a fact.</p>
<p>Suppose we introduced a Bill to reduce the tariffs of advocates. That hon. Senator complained about advocates just now.</p>

I do not blame a group with vested interests if they do not like measures which affect them.</p>
<p>I think I have replied now to everything which the hon. Senator put to me. Was there anything else he wanted to know?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#zijl">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. H. S. VAN ZIJL</person>:</from>
<p>Sources of information.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, the hon. Senator said: &#x201C;Editors may not divulge their sources of information.&#x201D; It is true, of course, that there is no privilege under criminal law for a newspaperman. There is no such thing. There is also no privilege for a minister of religion and his congregation. There is absolutely no privilege, except in the case of the attorney and his client. That is the only privilege that exists. Everybody else has to disclose their source of information when a criminal provision applies.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Schoor made a very interesting speech and stressed that this legislation concerned untruths. He also put the very fair question to everybody present here, and also to the Press: Are you opposed to our request that untruths should not be published deliberately? I am not speaking of untruths which are published accidentally. Yesterday we had a debate here&#x2014;the hon. Senators knows this&#x2014;and what appeared in one of the Afrikaans newspapers this morning? According to the report I am supposed to have said that the Defence Force and the Navy also have their black sheep. The hon. Senator has just quoted from my speech and nowhere did I say a word about black sheep in the Navy and the Defence Force. But I do not blame the Press for such allegations, Sir. I realize they sit in the gallery here and listen to what we have to say, and as black sheep are always to be found in any society, they probably decided to report that the Navy and the Defence Force also had their black sheep, or that Minister Kruger had said that the Navy and the Defence Force also had their black sheep. But Minister Kruger did not say that, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kruger is innocent Perhaps the Navy will blame me, but meanwhile I said nothing against them.</p>
<p>As I have already said, Sir, we do not react to every inaccurate news report. I realize these are people attuned to writing news. This legislation will not be implemented in such a way that nobody dare make a mistake. The hon. Senator need not fear that. Action is aimed at absolutely gross untruths against the S.A. Police, deliberate untruths which will destroy the Force. No reasonable pressman can object to that.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Rensburg also spoke of the law societies and I want to say something about that. I have already raised this point, but one should emphasize it. The hon. Senator Van Rensburg made a very important point. He said here is a case where a court might decide that an untruth was deliberately disseminated or otherwise. That gives protection to the Press, Sir. This Bill does not provide that if the Press publishes an untruth it will be liable to a fine of R10 000 or five years&#x2019; imprisonment We have not said that. We give the Press the opportunity as far as gross untruths are concerned to say that they were under the impression that it was the truth and then they have to give their motivation. If their motivation is reasonable, the matter will be finalized. That is a very important point.</p>
<p>The law societies came to discuss this with me, Sir, but custom dictates that one does not disclose private discussions with such associations. It is not my policy when people come to consult me in my office to talk about it outside at some future time. I am not prepared to talk about my interview with the law society, except to tell the hon. Senator that in my view, the arguments which the association advanced were not of such a nature that they would be harmed in any way by this legislation.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to single out any newspapers or mention names, but there are newspapers in South Africa which will have no difficulties in this connection. There are certain newspapers which try hard to make peace between myself and the Press, and these are the newspapers who have sinned the least. That is the truth. The Press bosses and journalists who often come to talk to me, and ask if we cannot find some common ground, are those persons who give me the least trouble. We do have good people, Sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to heap coals of fire upon the head of the Press by way of this Bill. When this Bill becomes law, if it becomes law, I shall be open to discussion. I am prepared to talk to individual editors. My experience and my view is that the Press Union does not have the necessary control over individual editors. That is my opinion, and I do not know if that is the case or not. I should therefore like to consult the editors because in my view they have more control over what is published. The editor who wants to see me about this Bill to see whether some or other arrangement can be made before we take a dispute to court, can come to my office at any time. I am always available for that sort of discussion. We are not going to be unfair or unreasonable but, Mr. Chairman, we are not going to allow the S.A. Police to be defamed any more by irresponsible Press reports or by any person. And this does not apply only to the Press but also to any person who unjustly and deliberately defames the S.A. Police. That sort of thing will not be tolerated any longer.</p>

<p>I will go on all afternoon if you are not careful. Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister is still missing the point.

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>But it does not work that way. The hon. the Minister took an attitude yesterday, and I want to give him a perfect example of what I mean. It becomes a matter of opinion. The hon. the Minister was, in fact, upset by <i>The Cape Times</i> because they published a report on police pay in regard to a debate in the Other Place. I mentioned it in my Second Reading speech that the hon. the Minister should concentrate on police pay rather than on legislation of this nature. The hon. the Minister then told <i>The Cape Times</i> that he would bring two senior officers from Pretoria who are involved in this particular issue.</p>

<p>&#x2026; because the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude in regard to that particular article in <i>The Cape Times</i> was that it was damaging to the police, this question of a discretion in pay. It did not do the morale of the police any good.</p>

<p>The hon. Senator Koch says &#x201C;right&#x201D;. I hope she has read this morning&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times</i> in which some very well-known policemen are quoted as saying that the article that appeared did in fact do no harm to the police at all; in fact, it did them a world of good because they suddenly found that there was somebody fighting for their rights, which the hon. Senator Koch might well do. Mr. Chairman, I think we might get down to some brass tacks in this issue. General Keevy is quoted &#x2026; The MINISTER OF POLICE: The hon.

<p>Mr. Chairman, once the police are on duty they are functioning. I agree that one cannot afford to harm the S.A. Police Force, but I do not agree with the way the hon. the Minister is trying to prevent the police from being harmed. I am saying the police do not need a clause like this at all. I believe it is an insult to the police of South Africa, because the 1% or 2% bad eggs in the Police Force will be caught out soon enough. The discipline in the Police Force is well known; they control their men extremely well. They do not need this sort of legislation to protect themselves against the bad eggs. It is the fact that it can be brought to light which brings the bad eggs to light in the Police Force.</p>

<p>If the hon. Senators on the other side want that sort of debate they will get it. I am talking to the hon. the Minister in all friendliness. I know he has problems. With a department of this nature one must have problems, no matter who the Minister is, and I am saying to him that the clause talks about what is true and untrue. What I have just read to him shows that there is great deal of difficulty in regard to what is truthful reporting and what is absolute truth. If somebody says to the hon. the Minister that black is white, and the hon. the Minister then says: &#x201C;It has come from a good source, it must be so.&#x201D; I have probably used the wrong terms in dealing with the Nationalist Party but let us take something of that nature as an illustration&#x2014;the hon. the Minister says: It comes from a good source, it must be so, so he makes a statement because the information he has has come from a reliable source. The newspaper prints that; they believe it to be true but in the long run it turns out that it was not true&#x2014;it is either devoid of all truth or it is only half the truth.

He could not afford to do it He has advertisers, he has shareholders; he cannot even afford to have the newspaper placed at risk.

Let me say this: If the hon. the Minister tells me something, whatever it is&#x2014;he is a Minister with responsibility, he is a member of the Cabinet and he holds very high office&#x2014;I accept what he tells me to be the facts so I publish those facts as a newspaper man. Sometime later it comes to light that the Minister was given the wrong facts. It is not his fault that he has given me the wrong information. He got it in the first place, so I cannot say that he deliberately misled me. He told me something which he believed to be true, which ultimately proved to be untrue. I am saying to the hon. the Minister that this could happen time and time again so, when this Bill becomes law and the hon. the Minister tells me something like that, unless I have seen it with my own eyes, virtually, &#x2026;</p>

The hon. Senator has referred to cases where information is supplied by the hon. the Minister or a responsible person but in the case referred to yesterday, the man seems to have been picked up off the streets and his story was embroidered upon with the result that it did the police immeasurable harm.</p>

<p>I must say that my own feeling about <i>The Cape Times&#x2019;s</i> reporting of police wages is cynical, to say the least. I feel the same way about their reporting of a former policeman, Gen.

<p>I can remember how, with the help of certain newspapers, the police were booed at the Rand Easter Show at one stage. I can remember that this was fanned by certain sections of the Press. Now, I want to say that without the police we would be in a very bad position. The hon. Senator Winchester does not embroider upon the truth but he and I see things differently. We had a little altercation the other day about police action in Sea Point.</p>

<p>No, but there is a difference. It is rather like what is happening in certain areas of the United States and England. One sees this on television programmes. The police in the United States are being crippled because the news media give them such a bad reputation that they cannot do their duty. This is happening in the great democracies of America and England. We cannot afford this. No matter what the niceties of the situation may be and no matter how it might appeal to some people to have untruths printed every day, with a denial in small print the next day or a week later, we cannot allow this. What is more, not only cannot we allow it but we are not going to allow it, no matter what squeals are put up by the Opposition and by the Opposition Press.</p>

<p>I am afraid it has a great deal to do with the issue. A policeman must not fear what the media can do to him because he has to take certain action. No matter how little some people may like it, that is the feeling in this country at the moment. I do not want to harp on Swellendam, but I think the number of votes that the PFP received in Swellendam will show them that our attitude towards the police is shared pretty generally in this country. What is more, the attitude towards the Press is shared also pretty generally in this country.</p>
<p>I am aware of the fact that the majority of <i>The Cape Times</i> readers are non-Whites, so certain things that they print are very often printed in order to play up to their readers. I also doubt their sincerity in respect of the police. If I were the person responsible and the hon. Senator Winchester called me in to discuss something, I would go so that he could put his case. If I disagree with his case I would fight it again but I certainly would not refuse to go when a Minister of the same country in which he lives gives up his time and the time of important members of his staff to try to show them what the problem is.</p>
<p>I do not think we are going to get anywhere with the type of opposition hon. Senators opposite are putting up. We are all worried about the salaries of the police but it is a very complicated affair.</p>

<p>I just want to say to the hon.

I believe all the other clauses are fine. I shall deal with the disciplinary aspects in reference to the police during the Third Reading debate. I have nothing but praise for the Police Force. I think I happen to be in a rather unique situation in regard to the police. I was largely responsible for starting the Police Reserve in South Africa. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister knows that; he was not Minister of Police at the time. So I have nothing but the highest regard for the police. I shall reserve my other remarks for the Third Reading debate. I just want to refute the argument that anything we have said is in any way detrimental to the police. In fact, we are trying to protect the police because we do not believe they deserve legislation of this sort.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the merits of this particular clause have been very thoroughly discussed by both sides of the House. I think the question this House has to consider is at what stage and by whom prosecutions will be instituted. In this connection it may perhaps be necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, No. 51 of 1977. Section 2 provides that the power to prosecute shall vest in the State. Section 3 provides that the power to prosecute on behalf of the State, shall vest in the Attorney-General. Section 4 provides for the delegation of power. Section 7 provides that should the Attorney-General refuse to prosecute and issue a certificate of <i>nolle prosequi</i>, a private person may institute prosecution proceedings; in other words, a member of the Force and so forth. As I have said, Sir, the merits have been very thoroughly discussed. The hon. the Minister has given us clear answers and in order to eliminate a shortcoming which is apparent at first glance, I want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On page 8, after line 26, to add the following subsection to the proposed section 27B:<br/>(2) No prosecution shall be instituted in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1) except upon the written authority of the Attorney-General concerned.</block>
<p>All the particular statements taken and investigations made, will of course be forwarded to the Attorney-General and he will then decide whether or not to prosecute. I listened attentively to all the members of the Opposition but not one of them objected to the Attorney-General having the discretion to decide whether or not to prosecute. I think the insertion of the amendment should remove any further objections that the Opposition may have. I think that they will be satisfied now and that they will support the legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. Senator Van Rensburg for the amendment, which I accept. This amendment should, in fact, allay any fears the Press may have had that all the prosecutors or any one prosecutor would have been able to institute proceedings against them. In order to ensure that only responsible people will deal with these matters, I am quite satisfied that the Attorneys-General of the Divisions concerned should first give written authorization for such proceedings. The only other point that I should like to clear up is the one raised by the hon. Senator Winchester.</p>
<p>†The hon. Senator Winchester quoted from <i>The Daily News</i>&#x2014;I may just add that I do not have much respect for that newspaper&#x2014;as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Mr. Kruger confuses honest and truthful reporting with reporting absolute truth.</block>
<p>That is not so, Sir, and neither does the Bill confuse the two. It is only <i>The Daily News</i> that confuses them. I shall tell the hon. Senator why. We are not talking about absolute truth in this Bill; we are talking about absolute untruth. That is a very big onus&#x2014;to prove an absolute untruth, and that onus is foursquare on the State. The State must prove beyond reasonable doubt that it is an absolute untruth, and that is a very heavy onus. Then we come to honest and truthful reporting and there the onus is placed on the Press. The Press must simply have reasonable grounds for believing that the statement is true. In other words, it must be honest and truthful reporting. That is exactly what this is all about So <i>The Daily News</i> has got the wrong end of the stick.</p>
<p>I want to tell the hon. Senator Winchester that I am in fact against the shifting of the onus. I was against the shifting of the onus right from the beginning. But the law advisers told me and I accepted what they told me as being correct&#x2014;I know it is correct&#x2014;that when something is so totally within the specific knowledge of an accused himself that it becomes impossible for the State to prove that inner knowledge that a reporter would have, the onus must shift to him. The onus shifts in all sorts of cases, Sir. Let me just explain this to the hon. Senator. Let us take the case of theft, for argument&#x2019;s sake. The State proves that an article has been stolen from A; it then proves that the article was found in the hands of B. What happens then? That is a <i>prima facie</i> case of theft, Sir. Then the onus shifts to the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities how he acquired the article and where he acquired it. That is all this onus is doing; it is because this is within the peculiar knowledge of the person concerned. The law advisers say that in that particular case the onus must shift to the accused. That is the only reason why it is set out because we did not want a total onus on the Press; the Press must just show reasonable grounds for believing that the statement was true after the State has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was untrue. I think this is extremely fair towards the Press and that was why I felt it needed to be said.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move subject to Standing Order No. 56&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Third Time.</block>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we have come to the last stage of the discussion of this Bill. I am afraid I am not persuaded by the arguments of the hon. the Minister to change my mind as to the seriousness of this Bill. I submit that this Bill is a grave inroad on the freedom of the citizens in South Africa. It is a grave inroad on democracy. I submit that it will have the effect of gagging the Press as regards activities of the police. This is part of a trilogy of Bills that are coming before our Parliament, one of which we have already dealt with, except for the Third Reading. This particular Bill is one and the other, I believe, has been read a First Time in Another Place this afternoon. I am ashamed to say that the accumulative effect of these Bills will be to cause a tremendous amount of suspicion to be cast upon South Africa by the world around us, because they will construe this legislation as an inroad upon the freedom of the people of South Africa, upon the freedom of the Press and upon democratic institutions in this country. At this stage I wish to answer certain of the points that the hon. the Minister dealt with in the Committee Stage. I feel that the arguments that were submitted by him in answer to arguments that were put before this hon. House by me, are not satisfactory.</p>
<p>The first point that the hon. the Minister dealt with is that the Bill was directed towards the black sheep in the journalist profession and that it was not directed in any way against the Press and against responsible journalists. Precisely the same thing is said as regards the Prisons Act. It has, however, had the effect of gagging all types of reporting in respect of the prisons of South Africa, except for reports which put the prisons into a favourable light. I did not say I contend that there had been no reports on the prisons as the hon. the Minister thought I did. There is a misunderstanding there. What I did, and I have it here, in my speech during the Second Reading debate was to quote what was said by Mr. Kelsey Stewart, namely that the effect of the similar provision in the Prisons Act was to prevent all reporting other than reporting which is favourable to the prisons. My submission is that this will have the same effect as far as the police are concerned.</p>
<p>The next point that was made by the hon. the Minister related to the question of the rights that any policeman has of recourse in the courts of the land in respect of any defamatory statements against him. I agree with the hon. the Minister that a portion of the clause relates to the Force, but a portion relates to individual policemen. I will read out the clause, if I may, Sir, with your permission. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Any person who publishes any untrue matter in relation to any action by the Force &#x2026;</block>
<p>This relates to the Force and I agree that the law of defamation does not apply&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; or any part of the Force, &#x2026;</block>
<p>I agree, the law of defamation does not apply&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; or any member of the Force in relation to the performance of his functions &#x2026;</block>
<p>that does apply to any policeman who is alleged to be responsible for some misdemeanour which is defamatory of him, when this misdemeanour has taken place when he is carrying out his functions. And I suggest to you Sir, that as far as Atherstone and Godwin are concerned, the two policemen who were found guilty in the Nkane case, if the allegation had been made against them that they had been responsible for barbarous and brutal treatment&#x2014;which is <i>per se</i> defamatory&#x2014;and that allegation was untrue, they would have had an action through the court against such a person who had made the allegation, be it the Press or anybody else. That is the point I am making, in contradistinction to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s construction of clause 9 that is under consideration.</p>
<p>The next point the hon. the Minister made was: &#x201C;What can the complaint be?&#x201D; The gravamen of our complaint relates to the penalty. Sir, the hon. the Minister can tell us if there is any other law in South Africa which has a comparable penalty for the type of mischief that this is intended to prevent&#x2014;R10 000 fine or five years&#x2019; imprisonment, or both such fine and such imprisonment? Is there any other penalty so savage, Sir? That is our complaint, Sir. The intention of this is to prevent editors and journalists from undertaking any form of what is known as investigative journalism. That is clear, Sir. It will have that result. As I stand here this afternoon, I believe that from now on we will have no investigative journalism of the type that we had in Nkane&#x2019;s case and report it. That is our main complaint against this measure. The fact that there is this savage penalty indicates quite clearly to me what the object is of this Bill.</p>
<p>Sir, I am asking the hon. the Minister if he knows of any other legislation in this country which has such a savage penalty and where the mischief is as minor as it is in this case.</p>
<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister has said that the police should be protected. Why should they be put in a position different from that of any other public servant? That is what I would like to know. [Interjections.] Take the instance of a judge or magistrate or any other public servant whose misdemeanours will reflect upon the country. He is in no better or no worse position than the police are. No, Sir, I am afraid that is no answer.</p>
<p>Then, Sir, the hon. the Minister took another point. He said I had misconstrued what I have called the operative portion of this Bill. I will read the operative portion of this Bill, Sir. It states&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; without having reasonable grounds (the onus of proof of which shall rest on such person) for believing that that statement is true, &#x2026;</block>
<p>The hon. the Minister gave his construction during the Committee Stage as to what those words meant. Sir, let us see what he says &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us take note as to what the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech when he placed a construction upon those words. He said the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">They have to do their jobs to the best of their ability to find out whether it is true; they have to try to verify it. That is all this Bill is about.</block>
<p>&#x201C;They have to try to verify it.&#x201D; Those are the very same words as one will find in the Prisons Act. It is the same construction; the same words &#x2026;</p>

<p>They are exactly the same words. He repeated them later on. &#x201C;We are not having them prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement is true.&#x201D; He gives the same construction as we find in the Prisons Act, Sir. The operative passage of the Prisons Act is&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; without having reasonable grounds for believing that the statement is true &#x2026;</block>
<p>That is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own construction as given in his Second Reading speech. I submit that that is the construction that will be placed on this by any judge before he has to deal with such a case. For that reason I suggest that there is no responsible editor in this country, whether he be an editor of the English-language Press or the Afrikaans-language Press, who will be prepared to face a penalty of R10 000 or five years&#x2019; imprisonment or five years&#x2019; imprisonment and a fine of R10 000. They would rather leave this type of investigative journalism completely alone. I do not blame them, Sir. I do not blame them for one moment.</p>
<p>So, Sir, this means the end of investigative journalism. I believe that is the reason why this measure has been introduced. But for the hon. the Minister to say that that is not an inroad into the powers and rights of the Press, the powers that have been enjoyed by the Press in every democratic country in this world, is not correct, Sir. There is no democratic country in this world that the hon. the Minister can cite to this hon. House where there is such a provision in the law. It is realized in democratic countries that where one has a situation such as we will have once this Bill becomes law, where the black sheep in the Police Force has no fear of having his evil actions brought to the notice of the world by means of the Press, there will be no means of deterring them, Sir. It will have a deterrent effect on investigative journalism &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, another point was made by the hon. the Minister in reply to my speeches both in the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage in regard to Mr. Nkane&#x2019;s case. My contention during the Second Reading debate on the Inquests Amendment Bill was that there was a cover-up in Nkane&#x2019;s case. I gave chapter and verse and do not intend to read the evidence that came out in a court of law in regard to that case. However, I want to say this. Eight days after Nkane had died, eight days after the regional magistrate had reported the fact to the District Commandant, eight days after the District Commandant had commenced an investigation&#x2014;this is according to him and I believe he did&#x2014;no action had been taken against the three policemen concerned. However, eight days after that the truth about what had happened to Nkane appeared in the national Press. That was followed immediately by the suspension of the constables concerned. The same day it appeared in the afternoon papers, these three people, Godwin, Atherstone and the Black policeman, were suspended.</p>
<p>What inference do you draw from that, Sir? I can only draw one inference, and I think it is a fair one. I think there must have been an investigation; I accept that there was. But I know that if there had been an investigation in a simple matter of that nature, they should have been suspended during the period of the eight days. What I cannot accept is that within the course of a few minutes, after there had been publication of what in fact had taken place, the whole of the investigation took place. I do not accept that. And for that reason I say that there was a cover-up in Nkane&#x2019;s case.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister then had a good deal to say about the Nationalist Press, and I will not repeat what he said as the hon. House heard what he had to say about that matter. I do not know of an occasion, Sir, in the last 30 years since I have been in politics, when there has been such complete unanimity between the English-and Afrikaans-language Press on a matter of public concern as there has been in respect of this particular Bill. I do not believe there is such a case. I think this is the first time in the history of this country, and certainly the first time in 30 years, that they have spoken with one voice against a Bill. And that is the point that we have made. I have not quoted from what has been said in the English-language Press.</p>

<p>The hon. gentlemen sitting on the other side are not impressed at all by what the English-language Press says, and I can say with perfect truth that much of what they say does not impress me either. But hon. Senators opposite are usually impressed, and very deeply impressed, when one can quote chapter and verse of what the Nationalist Press says. They should, however, be even more impressed when the Nationalist Press, the Afrikaans Press in this country, are unanimous in their condemnation of this Bill.</p>
<p>Sir, I would like to know from the hon. the Minister why he did not deal with three points. He asked whether there was anything further on which he should react &#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, I have had no opportunity to indicate whether there was any further point to which the hon. the Minister should reply. I had my three opportunities to address the House in the Committee Stage, and this is the first opportunity that I have of putting the further three points to the hon. the Minister so that he can have an opportunity of replying to them.</p>
<p>Firstly, I made a point of referring this hon. House to a statement that had been made by Adv. De Villiers. I have said before and I say again that Adv. De Villiers is held in high esteem, not only by the NP but also by this country. He is not only a director of a large group of the Afrikaans Press in South Africa and has knowledge, naturally, of these matters because of his official position in that company, but he is also one of the leading advocates in this country. He has represented South Africa overseas before UN and is therefore a man of great responsibility and great knowledge in both the legal and the Press sphere. And what did he have to say about this Bill, Sir? I will not quote precisely what he said because I do not have it before me, but I quoted it in my Second Reading speech. He said that once this Bill became law, it would draw a veil over the activities of the police, and that of course includes the nefarious activities of the black sheep in the police. That is what he said and it cannot be taken lightly, Sir. What he said there is a matter which should really be taken cognizance of by the hon. the Minister, and I cannot understand why he does not do so. The Cabinet and every hon. gentleman sitting on that side should take cognizance of what Adv. De Villiers has said in regard to this Bill.</p>

<p>They do not hold the same view. That is their answer. They do not hold the same view held by the opinionformers of the NP, and that is the Press of the NP. They do not hold the same view as that held by many of the foremost intellectuals in the ranks of the NP who have voiced their concern about this Bill. What view do they hold? They hold the view that there should be a muzzling of the Press in this particular sphere, the sphere that the Bill deals with, namely, the actions of the police. That will be the result of the Bill, Sir.</p>
<p>I raised another point that the hon. the Minister did not deal with, and I submit that it is a point that was raised by two of the leading organs of the Press in this country. They happen to be supporters of the NP and are Afrikaans newspapers. They submitted that this Bill would have the opposite effect to that which the hon. the Minister desires. As far as the public of South Africa are concerned, these newspapers maintain that this will raise the suspicion of the public in South Africa and lead them to believe that there is something wrong and that the hon. the Minister is seeking to cover up in certain cases&#x2014;that he does not wish the truth to come out. They said that this Bill would be counter-productive, and I am doing no more than repeating what the editors of these two well-known papers have said.</p>
<p>Sir, I have come to the end of what I have to say. But I do say that this is a sorry day in the history of South Africa. This is a day that I believe we will regret in the future, because I believe &#x2026;</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want first of all to deal with one or two matters that have been raised during the course of the debate. The first one that struck me was the hon. Senator Crook&#x2019;s remarks when he was dealing with the risks newspaper editors run if they infringe this Bill. I would say to the hon. Senator Crook that I can think of a probably worse penalty than any the hon. the Minister could have written into the Bill, and that is that those journalists who believe in Press freedom and others like them could be forced to join the NP. They would probably consider that sentence worse than the R10 000 fine that they could face.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Van Schoor is not here at the moment. He is probably writing an article on Press freedom. He interjected in the course of the hon. Senator Crook&#x2019;s remarks and said that he was hyper-sensitive in regard to Press freedom. I see he is now returning to the Chamber after probably having completed the article that he was writing on Press freedom. It was probably a fairly short one because he has very little belief in Press freedom. Sir, I want to say to him that his comment that the hon. Senator Crook was over-reacting in regard to Press freedom was I believe an absolute disgrace coming from an hon. Senator with a background like his. I do not believe that one can over-react on the matter of Press freedom because our whole democratic system, our country in fact depends and hinges on this whole matter of Press freedom. This is the most disturbing feature of this whole Bill. This Bill and four or five others are bringing down the curtain on democracy as we have known it in this country over the 60-70 years since Union and the way it has developed over 700 years in the Western system.</p>

<p>That is pretty well what is going to happen; I am glad the hon. Senator used those words. Mr. President, we may well return to the Dark Ages. [Interjections.] The attitude of the NP has always been that if you do not like what the Press is saying, muzzle the Press. They have threatened it for years. They keep saying they are going to do it, and now they have come piecemeal, with the Prisons Amendment Bill fairly recently, the Inquests Bill and now this legislation and they are gradually muzzling the Press because the Press do not always write what they would like them to write.</p>
<p>Even their own Press is going to suffer, and that after years of abject slavery on their part to the NP. We have a perfect example here in the hon. Senator Van Schoor who was a pressman of some distinction himself. By his very utterances in this House he has made it quite clear that he served the NP in his job as newspaper editor rather than serving the Press. This has been going on for years.</p>

<p>I do not mind if that is his conviction. One is grateful that he left the newspaper and left the editor&#x2019;s chair if that was his conviction. But since he left the editor&#x2019;s chair there have been a few bold Afrikaans-speaking editors who write about matters in their newspapers which the Government does not like at all. It is mainly because of this, Mr. President, that we are now faced with legislation to curb the Press.</p>

<p>I do not want to hear the hon. Senator Carr. I think if he has got anything to say he should go outside and swing from the tree and say it there, because quite frankly he drives me round the twist. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I want to say, not only to the hon. the Minister who is just their mouthpiece but to hon. Senators opposite as well, that if they do not realize what they are doing to South Africa, then I despair for our future. The hon. the Minister has introduced a little Bill consisting of one small clause which is objectionable, but that clause is the nail in the coffin of everything we have believed in as far as Press freedom is concerned. The hon. Senator on the other side can pull faces, but I challenge him to check with the average policeman outside this House and ask him if he feels we need legislation of this sort. They do not need it. They have never thought they did need it. They can stand on their own feet and on their own reputation, and they have built a very fine reputation over the years. The hon. Senator Crook has referred to drawing a veil over the activities of these people, and that will mean that the Police Force are not even going to get the good reports they deserve. Newspaper editors will shy away from things relating to the S.A. Police because they will never be certain if action will be taken against them. They will leave the police alone, and that will do damage to the police; it will do damage to the morale of the police; it will do damage to the police&#x2019;s name among the public. I agree&#x2014;and I say this without any hesitation&#x2014;that we have one of the best Police Forces in the world. There are not many that can match us. I take nothing away from the Police Force. The public depend on our Police Force, and the 1% or 2% who kick over the traces is negligible. One always finds this. Perhaps the Angel Gabriel has a few in his team who might do that too. So that is no criterion.</p>
<p>But, Mr. President, the hon. the Minister comes with this sort of legislation which, as I have said before, is an insult to the police. They do not need it. The hon. the Minister has made great play of the fact that because of the onerous duties the police have to perform, the type of work they have to do, they cannot tolerate some of the things that have been said about them; it lowers morale and damages the police reputation in the particular climate in which we live. I think the hon. the Minister would be the first to admit that the police in South Africa have enormous powers. I am not saying that they should not have those powers, but the police by virtue of the tasks they have to perform have tremendous powers. They have tremendous powers of arresting people, removing them from their homes and incarcerating them in prison. They do have tremendous powers. The average person all over the world has always been a little fearful of a police uniform, and this has been so since time began.</p>
<p>What the hon. the Minister is doing is to create an air of mystery in regard to the Police Force. In years to come he will find&#x2014;because laws once on the Statute Book seem very difficult to take off&#x2014;that the police will have an aura of secrecy about them, something completly unwarranted and undeserved. But he is creating this aura of secrecy. As I say, Sir, this is going to damage the police.</p>
<p>I remember watching a TV interview a few weeks ago when a psychiatrist visiting South Africa from London was asked whether he objected to some of the groups that were so critical of psychiatry. He was asked if he took offence at some of their criticism. His reply was illuminating and I think it is something the hon. the Minister could well take note of. His reply was that psychiatry, his particular profession, operates in such a sphere that they almost have the power of life and death, and certainly over the freedom of people&#x2019;s lives. They have the right to incarcerate people. And because of that tremendous power, that frightening power which human beings take upon themselves, sometimes justifiably, it is necessary, it is essential under the democratic system in which we believe, that there should be checks and balances, there should be an expression of public opinion, even if the public opinion is not always well-informed, or as well-informed as it might be.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned a classic case which appeared in <i>The Star</i>, but he played down the fact that <i>The Star</i> published an apology, and I think rather an abject apology for that mistake.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-police">

<p>I read the apology.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, you read the apology. I believe there as no question that <i>The Star</i> in fact published an apology. They made a mistake, something which could happen to anybody. Even the police make mistakes, and I say to the hon. the Minister, rather let the police be found out in their mistakes, and let those responsible pay whatever price society demands of them because that is the way society works. It is essential that it should be so. It cannot be any other way, because the moment it is, you get into trouble. The hon. Senator Koch is looking at me so strangely. As a woman I thought she would have more compassion in matters of this sort.</p>

<p>It is essential, Mr. President, when somebody is given power at the same time to make sure that there are brakes and checks on that power. We are not doing that this afternoon. We are handing over a pillar of democracy in South Africa which could well result in damage to the Police Force and damage to the reputation of the Police Force. The hon. the Minister is going to be responsible for this. It is a terrible responsibility that he has taken on his shoulders and I cannot understand how he can do this. As I have already said to him, he has intimate knowledge of what misreporting or untruthful reporting can do to his own reputation. He has said that, he has given us examples of it, and I want to say that with those examples in mind he should not have come with legislation as silly and ridiculous as this. I say that the police do not need this legislation; they do not deserve this legislation, and democracy deserves it very much less. The hon. Senator Koch mentioned the British Police and how they have been hammered and treated by strikers and others in recent months and years in England, but have the police in England asked for legislation like this? I have not heard that they have done so, Sir. They face up to their difficult task which I think is an unfair task that is placed on them, but they face it squarely because that is how democracy works. It cannot work any other way, Sir. The moment hon. Senators opposite do not like something, however, they draw a curtain across it thinking that it will go away because they have done so.</p>
<p>As I have said, the hon. the Minister had some very unkind things to say to me yesterday. I repeat that I do not mind him having done so. He is entitled to give back what he gets but he will certainly go on getting it if he continues to behave in the manner in which he does. He mentioned the Prisons Act. I checked his Hansard where he referred to what I had said about the Prisons Act. I did not suggest to the hon. the Minister that there was something wrong in the prisons, and the hon. the Minister knows it. What I said to him about the Prisons Act was that he assumed that no news was good news. I now say to him that I do not know whether that is true. I do not know what is wrong in the prisons. I would like to know; I would like the wraps to be removed; the public is entitled to know because, whether we like it or not, some of our relatives may well be there and we should like to know what is going on in the prisons. Any society is entitled to know that. We certainly do not want to go back to the Dark Ages as one of the hon. Senators has mentioned. So, no news is not necessarily good news; not like the hon. the Minister seems to insist.</p>
<p>I now want to return to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s remarks to me in regard to the Biko case. The hon. the Minister quoted my Hansard perfectly correctly when I told him that he had stated that Biko had died of starvation. The hon. the Minister was most upset about that. He said he had never made the statement that Biko had died of starvation. I must be perfectly fair to the hon. the Minister; I am always fair. [Interjections.] Yes, I am always fair. I find it difficult to be fair to some of the hon. Senators opposite; they do not deserve it; but I do my best to be fair, let me put it that way. When I said that he had said that Biko had died of starvation, the hon. the Minister denied it. He is quite right, Sir, and I am being fair. He did not say that. What he was reported as having said is this, and I quote from the report&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x201C;The political leader, Mr. Steve Biko, died while in security police custody on Monday night, eight days after he began a hunger strike,&#x201D; the Minister of Justice, Mr. Jimmy Kruger, said yesterday.</block>
<p>The headline is &#x201C;Biko died after hunger strike&#x201D;. I said he died of starvation; the Minister is reported as having said that he died after a hunger strike. Call me a liar for a change in the wording! The hon. the Minister says he did not say that, but let us check what he actually did say. He may not have used the words &#x201C;he died after a hunger strike&#x201D; but he announced Biko&#x2019;s death and the whole chapter leading up to it is the fact that Biko refused food. He was on a hunger strike.</p>

<p>There is a big difference.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>If I used the wrong words in saying that he died of starvation I take them back; he died after a hunger strike as reported here. It was not only reported in the English-language newspapers; it was also reported in <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i> and the introduction is exactly the same: That he died after a hunger strike. If the hon. the Minister wants to play on words, Sir, I am prepared to accept it. This was in fact what was reported.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister says that he did not say that that, he did not make that statement at all. Then the hon. the Minister must agree with me that this Bill is so much trash, it is so much poppycock; it is just part of a pattern of Press censorship, of clamping down on democracy and the system of freedoms in South Africa. Why else must we have this Bill? Because the hon. the Minister knows that newspapers can truthfully print reports which afterwards turn out not te contain the actual facts as they happened. I quoted to the hon. the Minister what a newspaper said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Mr. Kruger confuses honest and truthful reporting with reporting absolute truth.</block>
<p>Mr. President, there is a difference. The hon. the Minister called me a fool yesterday. The newspapers reported that I was a fool. Sir, I want to tell you that that is not true, but the newspapers were correct. They reported a statement by the hon. the Minister, but it is not the truth! The hon. the Minister should know better than most people what the difference is between reporting the truth and the absolute truth. As I have said, he said that Steve Biko had died as a result of a hunger strike. He was simply reporting what he had been told. It is not his fault. He has got many faults but that is not one of them. He was reporting what he had been told but he believed it to be true and he reported it. But when the truth came out it was found that he did not die as a result of that but that he died of other causes. So surely the hon. the Minister must appreciate the difference between the two.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister can be excused because in an interview he gave to <i>Time</i> magazine in October 1977 he said this&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">I think that police judgment may have been at fault. With a big administration it is quite impossible for my office to control every single aspect &#x2026;</block>
<p>That is perfectly correct, Sir. Obviously it is impossible and it is obvious that their information may be at fault. It was at fault then and it may be at fault in some future case. So what is so terrible about that? Is it not right then that the fault should be admitted or must it be concealed? What the hon. the Minister is trying to do, whether or not he is aware of it, is to try to destroy criticism against the State and against State institutions, but he cannot do it this way, Sir. What he is going to do is to destroy the State; he is going to create an atmosphere in South Africa where nobody will believe anybody else. As I said before, after the lie about <i>The Citizen</i> in the Other Place, I am always chary about believing answers I get to questions from the most honest Ministers.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister will be creating this atmosphere in our public life and I believe it is a shame that he should do so. I believe that it is not only a shame that he should do so but it is also a shame that hon. Senators who have more knowledge, who have more experience and who should know better, lack the courage in the NP caucus to fight these issues when they come up. No matter what I have said about the defence of democracy in South Africa, I believe, fool that I am, that democracy is completely dead in South Africa, except in the caucuses of the political parties. Democracy in South Africa begins and ends in the NP caucus and in the caucus of the other political parties here. By the time the issues come before this House they are cut and dried. No matter what evidence or argument is produced, not one hon. Senator on the other side has the courage to get up and say: &#x201C;No, I have heard differently now; I am changing my mind.&#x201D; This is the tragedy we are facing; that is why we are following the path of all the other dictatorships and one-party states that have emerged over the past few years.</p>

<p>Does it matter whether they vote for me or not? Things have to be said. If he disagrees with me, let him get up and say that he disagrees with me. But he won&#x2019;t get up, because one can listen to every hon. Senator on the other side, and everyone will say almost exactly the same thing like a lot of parrots. They have learnt it upstairs in their caucus room and heaven help them if they say anything different. [Interjections.] This is where democracy will be finished entirely in South Africa. If the hon. the Minister wishes to be personal&#x2014;and I said I have no objection, because I launched a personal attack on him&#x2014;he is welcome to do the same thing to me. If the hon. the Minister wishes to be personal I want to let him know, and I want to let everybody else on that side know, that no matter what they say of me, no matter how personal they become towards me, I will stand here and do my duty as I see it, regardless of what they say. [Interjections.] The only thing that surprises me is that the hon. Senators, who are friendly, decent sort of people, nice sort of people, suddenly seem to have a little motor that switches itself off if there is any criticism of their party. This is what is killing our democracy. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>Before I conclude in regard to the hon. the Minister, I want to say something in respect of another point. He dealt with <i>The Cape Times</i> and its article about police pay. I raised this question of police pay at the Second Reading, and it was raised in his vote in the Other Place. I did not see the original article in <i>The Cape Times</i>, but obviously they were reporting the debate. The hon. the Minister said that he made an offer to <i>The Cape times</i> to produce two very senior officers who knew the subject to discuss it with them. <i>The Cape Times</i> never took up that offer. In <i>The Cape Times</i> this morning, which I read, there appeared statements from very prominent ex-policemen. I emphasize the word ex-policemen because who in his right mind who occupies an office would be too critical of the hand that feeds him? It does not happen; I believe I stick my neck out many times, but I would not do something like that. But, Sir, the people mentioned are important. One should bear in mind that when the hon. the Minister used this in an argument against me, he used it because I had said to him: &#x201C;Would this sort of legislation that we are now dealing with prevent newspapers reporting matters as they did in recent weeks in regard to police pay?&#x201D; That is what I put to him, because quite frankly I did not know. His answer was not a clear answer on that particular aspect but he referred to the discretion of <i>The Cape Times</i> in running a series of articles on poor police pay. He took the line, or implied if he did not actually take the line&#x2014;I did not make a note of his actual words&#x2014;that this was damaging to police morale that they should behave or write in such a manner. I think I am right in assuming that that was the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s objection to it. I want to say to him that he can be so wrong, his attitude can be so wrong, in regard to what is false and what is an untruth in regard to this Press legislation. I have here a report which appeared in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times.</i> General Keevey, as far as my knowledge of the police is concerned&#x2014;the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s is far greater than mine&#x2014;is a former Commissioner of Police, and was highly regarded throughout South Africa. He rendered wonderful service to the police. He said, and I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The articles were not bad for the morale of the police. It brought the policeman&#x2019;s lot to the notice of the public.</block>
<p>Surely the hon. the Minister must welcome that. How else do the police get their lot brought to the notice of the public? They are subject to all sorts of discipline, like the army and so on. This is one way in which they can do so. He says it is a good thing that this was done and he welcomes it.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The articles did a lot of good and the morale of the police did not suffer through them.</block>
<p>In other words, he is discounting the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s approach in this matter. Major De Klerk said the same thing. I have had letters from policemen complaining about what the hon. the Minister said months ago about their uniforms, i.e. that he told them that a certain amount was going to be spent on their uniforms. They did not see it for months. It is now beginning to come through. The point I am making is that these articles appeared in the Press. It is a good thing they appeared in the Press, because how else do the police get their complaints across? They do not have any trade unions. They do not go on strike. They serve long hours. They protect us. The hon. Senator Koch is quite right but I wish she would then defend this sort of stand I am making.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I want to deal with these matters very briefly. The arguments advanced by the last speaker were debated comprehensively during discussion on the various stages of this Bill. The hon. Senator Crook told me that he wanted to raise three points. Usually the points he wishes to raise multiply like rabbits but in this case, fortunately, they were reduced to two. I am pleased to reply to the two points raised by him.</p>
<p>He said that Adv. De Villiers of the Cape had addressed the Rand Afrikaans University and he wanted to know what I thought of that speech. In actual fact that has nothing whatsoever to do with this Bill and consequently I shall not reply to it. However, I can tell the hon. Senator that I have already replied fully to Adv. De Villiers&#x2019;s statements and I invite the hon. gentleman to read my Hansard of the Other Place. I do not want to repeat the entire reply.</p>
<p>†The hon. Senator also raised the point that the Bill would have the opposite effect and that it would raise the suspicions of the public. My answer to that is simply that I do not agree.</p>
<p>*I do not agree with what the hon. Senator said. I cannot take it any further than that. I want to thank those hon. Senators who took part in the discussion on this point. These were points that had to be raised and discussed.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we have now come to the end of this Bill. It was only during the debate we had in the Committee Stage that the hon. the Minister disclosed the real reason why this Bill has been brought before the House. And it was not as a result of a speech the hon. the Minister made. As I was making a speech the hon. the Minister interjected on several occasions. In consequence of those interjections, it became apparent that the reason why we have this Bill before the House and before the South African Parliament, so that it can become a law of South Africa, is because of the disclosures that were made in regard to the inquest proceedings regarding one Biko, a detainee who died in detention.</p>
<p>Sir, I never thought that we would reach the stage in South Africa where we would legislate in order to protect an hon. Minister from similar disclosures taking place in cases of a similar nature that might arise. Sir, I only wish to refer you to the last time I spoke and the interjections made by the hon. the Minister from which he has indicated that what is the reason why we have this Bill before the House.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I think I have clearly stated my objections to this legislation. As the hon. Senator Crook has said, it appears as if we have been presented with it in order to cover the incident that occurred in the unfortunate Biko case. As he says, it seems strange that we should rewrite the legislation of South Africa because of that particular incident. As I said on a previous occasion, I do not believe this is necessary; I believe it is only part of an unhappy gaggle of gagging Press Bills that we are now getting before this House. I believe it bodes no good for South Africa; it can only do us harm in the long run.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has made comparisons. He compares inquest proceedings with courts of law. My legal friends tell me that is a completely wrong assumption, and that there can be no comparison between those proceedings and a court of law. Therefore that argument does not hold up. I am inclined to accept the views of my legal friends who obviously know the subject better than I do. The hon. the Minister was repeatedly asked to give us examples as to why this measure is necessary. I think the public and certain hon. Senators in this House should find it particularly strange that all because of the result&#x2014;he only gave us one example&#x2014;of one example that was mentioned, we have this legislation before us. A great deal was written and said in regard to the particular example that he quoted. Unhappy things were written and were said, things that were damaging to South Africa. The hon. the Minister cannot blame anybody on this side of the House for those remarks.</p>
<p>I also believe that he cannot blame any pressman for the remarks made in regard to this unhappy affair. All the remarks which were damaging to South Africa, were in fact made by the hon. the Minister himself and nobody else. Whether he likes it or not, the world will long remember such expressions as &#x201C;his death leaves me cold&#x201D;. In whatever idiom those words were expressed, in the one that was used by the international media and by people in South Africa it was a very unhappy choice of phrase.</p>
<p>Mr. President, it seems to me that the hon. the Minister has brought in legislation to protect South Africa against his own actions; to protect the Press against the hon. the Minister himself. This is all it can be about because he has so far failed to produce any other incident where this was necessary. On the contrary, many people have advanced arguments as to why the present <i>status quo</i> should be allowed to continue. I said in a debate earlier this week that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s obsession with the Press is carrying things too far. I do not particularly like what the Press said about me today but I cannot bring in legislation to stop it. Heaven forbid that I would even try! But when the hon. the Minister is reported and does not like it, he has the power to do something about it. I think that that augurs ill for our future.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I have said all I wish to say on this unhappy and sad occasion. I will continue to say that we are slowly, surely, progressively destroying the democratic freedoms as we have come to know them, and those hon. Senators sitting over there, are as guilty as the hon. the Minister who introduces legislation of this nature into this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate the hon. Senator Horak asked me what the position would be in connection with Fish Hoek. I have gone into the matter and should like to read the note that I have received in that regard. It reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Kragtens artikel 159 van die Drankwet, 1977, kan the Staatspresident op versoek van &#x2019;n landdros of &#x2019;n plaaslike bestuur gerig aan die Minister, indien hy dit in die belang van die bevolking of &#x2019;n deel van die bevolking van &#x2019;n gebied wenslik ag dat die verkoop of verskaffing van drank in daardie gebied onderworpe gestel word aan beperkings of voorwaardes deur homself bepaal, by proklamasie in die <i>Staatskoe</i><i>rant</i> daardie gebied tot &#x2019;n beperkte gebied verklaar.</block>
<p>Volgens die voorsitter van die Drankraad is &#x2019;n proklamasie in dié verband uitgereik kragtens die genoemde bepaling se voorganger. Dieselfde bepaling was in die 1928-Wet. Daar bestaan geen rede waarom die proklamasie ingetrek sou word nie. Volgens die voorsitter sou dit waarskynlik net gedoen word indien die betrokke bevolking van die plek daarom vra. Sodra die nommer van die proklamasie opgespoor is, sal dit aan die Minister verstrek word. (Ek meen dit is intussen opgespoor.) Interes-santheidshalwe kan net genoem word dat &#x2019;n verbod oorspronklik opgelê is op 15 Junie 1818 deur Lord Charles Somerset in &#x2019;n grondbrief wat aan ene Andries Bruyns uitgereik is vir 1 308 morg wat ongeveer 65 riksdalers gekos het, in die woorde (en dit was op daardie verbod) „Not to keep a public winehouse&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I am all in favour of it, but I do not believe that Parliament is the place to propagate their interests. I am sure if one looked very carefully one would find some sort of law against using Parliament to further one&#x2019;s own personal interests. But this is my objection&#x2014; that Parliament is too often used in a matter of this sort. It is an unhappy thing. I think hon. Senators overlook the fact&#x2014;and for the sake of the record I want to make sure that it is noted again&#x2014;that it is recognized that we have one of the highest incidences of alcoholism in the whole of the Western world. We have a drunken driving problem which is rated one of the highest in the Western world. Our divorce rate is one of the highest in the Western world, and a great deal of this, according to what the social workers tell us, is due to the abuse of alcohol. We have one of the highest crime rates in the Western world, and this refers to all race groups. A great many of these are committed while the persons concerned are under the influence of liquor.</p>
<p>Despite all this, the Government spends the amount of money it does on the sale of liquor, which is something like over R200 million a year, through the Administration Boards. The Coloured Development Corporation finances 74 liquor outlets in Coloured areas costing nearly R10 million. This is all Government money, finance supplied by the State. It seems strange that the Government involves itself to such a great extent in the liquor industry.</p>
<p>As I said during the Second Reading debate, I have no objection to these people fostering their own business, but they have the finest lobby here in Parliament, the best lobby that there is. I am sure the goldmining industry does not have such a fine lobby here, and they contribute more to the South African Exchequer &#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, you can make that argument I am saying that in my view the goldmining industry does not have the influence that the wine farmers in the Western Cape have here. The hon. Chief Whip comes from the Free State; I do not think he is a wine farmer; I do not think it grows up there &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; but I bet he would love to have the influence that wine farmers have in the Western Cape with his own Government. He would love it, because they are all-powerful. All they have to do is click their fingers and the Minister who is responsible for this either finds himself pushed into it or he does it willingly, I do not know. But everybody gets up and there is another piece of legislation through the House. As I said yesterday, there have been 17 pieces of legislation since I have been in the House, affecting the liquor or the wine industry. I think they have the most wonderful lobby in the world, and while they have that wonderful lobby they are certainly not going to get any help from this person to try to foster it. I think they are doing very well on their own; let them spend their money. I think they spend too much on advertising, but I am certainly not going to support an industry like that while I sit in this House. They are doing very well; they do not need my help. Let them get on with it, I shall vote against the legislation. *Senator P. L. LA GRANGE: Mr. President, with your permission I should like to reply briefly to the speech made by the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat. The hon. Senator Winchester says that the wine farmers use the lobby of Parliament to plead their cause. He also says that they have been particularly successful in doing so. He said that the fact that the Liquor Act had been amended 17 times since he had been in Parliament proved how successful they had been. Sir, that is in fact the best compliment anyone has paid me since I have been a member of this House. There is only one wine farmer in this House and only two in the Other Place. If the three of us who have not held a caucus so far have been so successful with our representations, I think the hon. Senator has paid those two gentlemen and myself a special compliment.</p>
<p>I can summarize the reasons given by the hon. Senator for his objection to this legislation as follows: He says that South Africa has the highest incidence of drunkenness. Did the hon. Senator say that? Am I correct?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#grange">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. L. LA GRANGE</person>:</from>
<p>But is the main reason for this amendment, Sir, because we know from experience that when people drink spirits and alcohol they are in the greatest danger of abusing liquor. The sole aim of this legislation is to promote the drinking of wine, not that of alcohol. I have said previously that in terms of this legislation only wine will be offered for sale at grocery shops. Surely that is an attempt on the part of the Government to combat drunkenness and not to make spirits and alcohol more readily available. I really cannot follow the arguments of the hon. Senator in this connection.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the case of the wine houses that have been established by the KWV at Tulbagh, Worcester, Paarl and Stellenbosch. This has been done precisely in order to make liquor available when meals are served. It is not a question at all of liquor being available without meals being served. For these reasons the hon. Senator has in fact, strengthened me in my decision to support this legislation.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, whatever one may say or not say about the hon. Senator Winchester, one must admit that he has a social conscience. The trouble about the hon. gentleman, Sir, is that his social conscience is so often misdirected. In this case, I regret to say, that in my view his social conscience is badly misdirected. The hon. Senator is arguing that if one has greater restrictions on the sale of wine, one will reduce consumption. There is no instance in history to prove that, Sir. I told the hon. Senator about the prohibition experiment in the United States, a country for which he has great admiration even under its present administration&#x2014;he said so!</p>

<p>I never said that.</p>

<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Well, you did not regard McHenry as an enemy of South Africa and I tell you I do. However, do not let us go along on that line. I spoke to the hon. Senator yesterday in all seriousness about the situation in Australia, where in fact restricted drinking hours has led to an increase in both the tempo and the volume of consumption. The hon. Senator must therefore not think that if one restricts drinking hours or liquor outlets one will be dealing with the problem of alcoholism or the abuse of liquor. One will not, Sir. One must direct one&#x2019;s social conscience to reforming the characters and the trends and the desires of people who abuse alcohol. It is merely a palliative to argue in terms of restriction of drinking hours. And that is it. Therefore I regret to say that I cannot agree with the views of the hon. Senator Winchester and I support this legislation.</p>
<p>*I just want to put one matter right as far as the hon. Senator La Grange is concerned. He says there is only one wine farmer in this House. I do not know what the size of a farm must be before a person can claim to be a wine farmer, but my colleague, the hon. Senator Piet Swanepoel, has a wine farm in the Wellington district and I know that he has a KWV quota. I shall not say how I know about this, but I do know it. So the hon. Senator La Grange is not the only wine farmer. He may be a larger wine farmer, but my colleague, the hon. Senator Piet Swanepoel, is also a wine farmer. Senator P. H. S. VAN ZIJL: Mr. President, I should also like to make my small contribution in this regard. The KWV has always contented that wine is a healthy drink. With that concept in view I was extremely interested to read a report from London that appeared in <i>The Argus</i> of 15 May 1979. It reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Drinking wine may prevent fatal heart attacks, says a team of doctors in a report which should make happy reading for wine farmers of the Western Province and their customers. The finding follows a study of the drinking habits of people of 18 countries. The graph shows that countries which drink large quantities of wine have the fewest deaths. France and Italy drank more than everyone else, but had the lowest mortality rate in men aged 55 to 64. Britons on the other hand drank far less wine and heart attacks were far more common.</block>

<block name="quote">The medical report was that if wine has a protective effect then it is more likely to be due to constituents other than alcohol. Wines are rich in aromatic compounds and other trace components which give their distinct character and are beneficial to health.</block>
<p>[Interjections.] Would you just allow me to continue? That has been one of the precepts of the KWV. I agree with everything that has been said by hon. Senators. I will not enlarge on that. I just want to emphasize this aspect&#x2014;that wine comes from biblical times; it has been with us throughout history. I am not talking of spirits or beer. That is something entirely different. But in this regard wine has not been conducive to the destruction of people. The hon. Senator said that there is more drunkenness in South Africa than anywhere else in the world. He cannot be reading his international periodicals because it appears that in Russia nobody is at work on a Monday morning; everybody is drunk. That is an internationally accepted fact. It seems to me that it has something to do with the climate. There is a depressive atmosphere caused by the lowering clouds, and so they have recourse to drinking vodka. If they had recourse to wine instead they would probably be as convivial and pleasant as the French are.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The implementation of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977, is proceeding very smoothly. However, a few problems have arisen in practice which should be removed. The necessary amendments are being proposed in the Bill.</p>
<p>In clause 1 of the Bill, provision is made for the further detention of arrested persons where they cannot, because of their physical condition, be brought before a court within the prescribed period.</p>
<p>In clause 2, an erroneous reference is corrected.</p>
<p>Section 75 of the Act provides that an accused may only be referred from one court to another for trial if the first court does not have jurisdiction. This means that in cases where the former court does have jurisdiction, the Attorney-General cannot use his power in terms of the Act to designate another court for the trial of the accused. This matter is being rectified in clause 3.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that details of the previous convictions of an accused are received after he has already pleaded in a magistrate&#x2019;s court, and it then becomes evident that he should appear in a regional court with a view to a heavier penalty. At the moment, such an accused can only be referred to a regional court after conviction. In clause 4, provision is now made for the accused to be referred directly after plea in order to make it possible for the same magistrate who hears the case to impose the penalty as well.</p>
<p>The wording of sction 119 of the Act, which refers to the plea of an accused in a magistrate&#x2019;s court on a charge which must be tried in a superior court, is being amended in clause 4 in order to make it clear that an accused who has been released on bail or on warning by a police official may also be told to plead in a magistrate&#x2019;s court.</p>
<p>In terms of section 121 of the Act, the magistrate may stop proceedings after a plea of guilty on a charge which must be tried by a superior court, and the Attorney-General may then refer the accused to a competent court. Practice has shown that there should also be provision in such cases for a trial in another court, or for the institution of a preparatory examination. Provision is made for this in clause 6.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the Act is that accused persons should be enabled to plead before a court of law as soon as possible, after which they can be examined by the court in respect of the plea. Chapter 19 of the Act therefore provides that when a charge is to be tried in a superior court or is of such a nature as to justify a penalty which can only be imposed in a superior court, it may be put to the accused in a magistrate&#x2019;s court and he may be required to plead to it forthwith. It has been found that this procedure works well. Because regional courts only sit from time to time in certain centres, the need has arisen for such a procedure to be applied in respect of those courts as well. A proposed measure in this connection is contained in clause 7.</p>
<p>The amendments proposed in clauses 8 and 9 are merely consequential upon clause 6.</p>
<p>In section 144(1)(b), there is an erroneous reference to section 121(4), instead of section 121(3). However, it appears that all the references in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are in fact superfluous, which is the reason for clause 10(a). Clause 10(b) is also consequential upon clause 6.</p>
<p>†In terms of section 170(1) of the Act, an accused who fails to appear in court at a place and on a date to which the proceedings have been remanded, shall be guilty of an offence. Accused persons who have been released on warning have for some reason been excluded from this provision. As it is now uncertain whether there is any sanction for such cases, the amendment in clause 11 is proposed.</p>
<p>Section 239(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, provided for proof of certain facts by affidavit by any person upon whom a law conferred the power or imposed the duty to register or to record such facts, and did not require the person making the affidavit to be the same person who registered or recorded the facts concerned. The wording of section 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977, apparently requires the person who registered or recorded such facts to make the affidavit. It was not intended to amend the 1955 provision. Section 212(3) of the Act is therefore brought into line with the previous provision by clause 12.</p>
<p>The provisions of section 217 of the Act in many cases render it unnecessary for a magistrate to give evidence in respect of a confession heard by him. The anomaly that the interpreter must in such cases still give evidence, is removed by clause 13.</p>
<p>In terms of the said section 217 a confession made before a magistrate is, under certain circumstances, upon the mere production thereof, admissible in evidence against the accused. The word &#x201C;confession&#x201D; does, in law, not include an admission, with the result that a document containing an admission cannot be dealt with under the provisions of section 217. In clause 14 it is proposed to make similar provision for admissions.</p>
<p>In terms of section 296 an accused cannot be referred to a rehabilitation centre established under the Coloured Persons Rehabilitation Centres Law, 1977, of the Coloured Persons Representative Council. The insertion of a reference to the said law is proposed by clause 15.</p>
<p>From time to time applications for compensation exceeding R2 000 and R1 000 are made to regional courts and magistrates&#x2019; courts respectively. Merely because the jurisdiction of the said courts in such matters is limited by section 300, the cases concerned must be tried in superior courts. By clause 16 the jurisdiction for awarding compensation will be increased to R10 000 in the case of regional courts, which amount is equal to their criminal jurisdiction, and R1 500 in the case of magistrates&#x2019; courts, which is equal to their jurisdiction in civil cases.</p>
<p>The conditions of bail pending review cannot at present be amended. The necessary provisions are proposed in clause 17.</p>
<p>A difference in the wording of the previous Criminal Procedure Act and the present one has the effect that an offence in terms of an enactment or regulation promulgated for or by a divisional council, can no longer be compounded. This omission is rectified in clause 18.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this afternoon we come to what could be a highlight of the session in the Senate, viz. the debate on the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development I believe the department is now going to be called &#x201C;The Department of Co-operation and Development&#x201D;, and I sincerely hope that we will in fact find that in future we are going to have co-operation and development with this department.</p>
<p>I believe there are three issues which must take the time of the House this afternoon and I want to discuss them with the hon. the Deputy Minister of Plural Relations. I must say that I am disappointed that the hon. the Minister is not here, but we are very glad that the hon. the Deputy Minister has been able to come. I know this is by arrangement &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>The question of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s promotion or otherwise is of course something we can discuss at some other time.</p>
<p>As I was saying, there are three issues that I believe we should discuss. The one is the question of influx control, not so much the question of whether there should be influx control but the manner in which influx control is administered in this country. The second aspect is the purchase of land for the Black areas and, tied with that is, of course, the question of consolidation. The third matter I wish to discuss with the hon. the Deputy Minister is the question of the system of the sale of sorghum beer. I wish to discuss with him certain complaints I have come across and make certain suggestions to him to alleviate certain hardships. I wish to do so in respect of all three of those subjects, not only in the case of the sale of sorghum beer.</p>
<p>I think the most important subject, the one that affects most people and is the most topical at the moment, is that of the purchase of land for the Black areas. This is something which those of us who sit here this afternoon have inherited. It has become a legislative and moral obligation of the Government of the Republic of South Africa, those of us who sit here, to purchase certain land and to hand it over to the Black people for their sole occupation. Unfortunately, what has happened in the past few years with the development of the policy of the Nationalist Party, is that this legislative and moral obligation has become obscured by another issue that was introduced by the Nationalist Party, namely, the philosophy of independent Black States. Coupled with this is the question of consolidation.</p>

<p>Because consolidation is part of independence, and the only independence we have had is that of Transkei. Let us deal with it The only block which was consolidated to any marked degree within South Africa and the only one where independence has worked, is Transkei. That hon. Senator knows that at the moment there is dreadful trouble between the Government of the Republic and the Government of Bophuthatswana because of the failure to consolidate before Bophuthatswana became independent I am sure that my colleague who shares this bench with me will discuss this question a little later. Until such time as we achieve total consolidation I believe we have to forget about the question of independence. In terms of our policy this consolidation is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Is that the only aspect of consolidation?</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>We are talking about the consolidation of land and that hon. Senator must not try to be clever. I do not think I should be led astray by that hon. Senator, Sir. Let me address myself once again to the hon. the Deputy Minister, Sir, and ask him if he will tell us this afternoon why it is that the Government is dragging its heels in not purchasing the quota land? I am now referring to the &#x201C;quota land&#x201D; only, the purchase of which, as I say, remains a legislative and moral obligation of the Government of the Republic of South Africa. When one thinks of the uncertainty, the insecurity and the worry that is being suffered today by so many White people who are involved in the consolidation proposals and who are waiting for their land to be bought in order to provide the quota land, I believe that the failure of the Government to do something about it is unforgivable. But when one looks at the other side of the coin and considers the harm that is done to race relations and the frustrations which are occasioned to the Black people by the failure to transfer this land to the homeland Governments, this becomes criminal neglect for which the Government must take full responsibility. The answer we are given whenever we ask why the Government does not get on with it, is that they do not have any money. What has an examination of the accounts of the Development Trust revealed? It has revealed that at the end of the 1978 financial year the South African Development Trust carried forward an unexpended balance of R15 million. This R15 million was not spent although it had been allocated for the purchase of quota land. I believe it is criminal that this Government should not have spent that money and should have denied the Black people the opportunity of occupying the land that could have been purchased with that money. And if we examine the accounts of the Trust at the close of the financial year ended 28 February 1979 we find that again an amount of R15 million was unexpended, which brings the total unexpended amount to R30 million. When that is coupled with the R69 million which we are being asked to vote today, we have an amount of nearly R100 million which is available for the purchase of quota land. I believe that that R100 million can go an awful long way towards purchasing sufficient land to meet both the demands of the homelands for quota land and the obligations of the Government in this regard. When one looks at the harm that is done to race relations and the frustrations of the Black people, the failure to do this becomes criminal neglect I demand that the Government now meet its legal obligations and immediately acquire and transfer the balance of the quota land to the homelands. In this demand I must also say to the hon. the Minister that there are thousands of hectares of land which have already been purchased by the Trust but which have not yet been handed over to the homeland governments. If ever there was a compounding of their culpability in this matter, it is that fact Whilst the Blacks are crying out for land there is land which has been bought in their name and has not yet been transferred to them; they are not yet allowed to occupy that land.</p>

<p>Precisely what I say; that it is being farmed by friends of the Government who have been able to get these farms at low rentals, if any, which they are farming for their own profit and at the expense of the Black people of this country.</p>
<p>Can one wonder that the attitude of people like Chief Gatsha Buthelezi and other leaders of the Black people has hardened? What is the position in kwaZulu? There is a miserable 32 000 ha of land owing to the Zulu people. That is all it is&#x2014;32 000 ha. Of that land nearly 30 000 ha is available as State-owned land, land which is unoccupied by anybody, which is not utilized by the State and available for kwaZulu to take over now. Why does the hon. the Minister not hand that land over immediately?</p>

<p>Yes, as part of the quota. That would leave somewhere in the region of 3 000 ha to be purchased for which, as I have just pointed out, this year the Trust has R100 million. I believe that in a few months this Government could satisfy its full obligation to the Zulu people and, remember, Sir, the tremendous gain there will be in goodwill between the Blacks, particularly the people of kwaZulu, and the White people of Natal if this were to be done. I believe it is possible. I do not believe it is necessary for the Government to say that it cannot be done. I believe they can do it [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the nature of things and because of the limited time at my disposal, I shall not be able to reply to the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat. I want to confine myself to a subject which I think is of great importance and which is closely related to the nations policy of South Africa. The NP policy is generally known but what I have tried to get clarity on, without success, in recent years, is the policy of the Opposition and, in particular, that of the official Opposition in the Other Place. The more I try to dig, Mr. Chairman, the more I come to the conclusion that everything leads to only one conclusion, and that is total integration, integration in every conceivable sphere, constitutional, political, social, communal and even educational.</p>

<p>I shall prove it to you, Sir. [Interjections.] The Opposition makes free use of the preposition &#x201C;con&#x201D; which means a throwing together, a conglomeration, a bringing together of all the people. For instance, they speak of a concept. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Concoction.</p>

<speech by="#odendaal">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. L. ODENDAAL</person>:</from>
<p>A Conglomeration, yes, a concoction. Now they say their policy is consociation, but I see Dr. Van Zyl Slabbert has extended it still further. In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 28 January 1979 he calls it &#x201C;consociationalism&#x201D;. He might just as well have said national socialism, which has just as little meaning for us. I have it here if you want to read it, &#x201C;consociationalism&#x201D;. I think he might as well have added another &#x201C;commu&#x201D; and make it &#x201C;consosiaciocommunalism&#x201D;. Then he would have included every conceivable political stream in one concept This gives you an idea of the sort of conglomeration they actually have in mind, Sir. The only provision he does in fact make is that when such a national convention has been held and has framed a constitution, they will protect the rights of minorities. Bishop Tutu told him the other day: &#x201C;Whitey, leave us alone.&#x201D; The bishop said the so-called protection of the rights of minority groups is not worth the paper it is written on. Nowhere in Africa are minority groups recognized. They are suppressed by force by the majority groups in Nigeria, just to give one example. In the whole of Africa almost nothing remains of democracy; the states are governed by dictators and such like. In other words, Sir, it is a vain dream and it is the most unrealistic thing one could imagine.</p>
<p>Now they are introducing precisely the same theory into the educational arena. Recently we passed a Bill in terms of which Black universities were allowed, for instance, to admit Black students of other language groups. The PFP voted for it. I might add that the hon. PFP Senator here did not have the moral courage to vote for it. Of course, he realized that it would be nonsensical to say that it tended to take the direction of their integration policy. He waited in the lobby outside until everything was over before he came in again. In any case, Sir, the PFP gave it their so-called support because it was apparently in the direction of so-called university integration. Mr. President, we all know that there is no truth in that and there is no sense in it. It is purely a humanitarian, pragmatic consideration to allow, for instance, a Zulu student who happens to be in Pietersburg, to continue his studies at the University of the North&#x2014;to use a practical illustration&#x2014;should the university authorities consent to it. There is no sense saying that the NP or the Government is moving in the direction of integration in the sphere of schools.</p>
<p>Total integration of nations, on the education level as well, is an idle hope without any substance. It is absolutely unrealistic and unnatural. The actual position in the world, not only in South Africa, shows precisely the opposite. Reality also shows the absolute correctness of the policy of the Government and the NP, namely that of the independent and separate development of nations, constitutionally, territorially, ethnically, culturally and educationally as well. That is the natural, realistic, urgent need of each nation, namely, that each nation wants to develop according to its own nature, its own being and its own character, language and spiritual values. To prove this statement&#x2014;I do not want to mention NP policy now&#x2014;I want to read a few extracts from a speech. I think the hon. Senator Winchester would like to listen to this. It is a speech which Mr. Harry Oppenheimer made recently at the University of the Witwatersrand. He gave a special lecture there. The theme was: &#x201C;Good Reasons for Ethnic Universities.&#x201D; I quote from a newspaper report, as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Industrialist, Harry Oppenheimer, said in Johannesburg last night &#x2026;</block>
<p>This was on 20 March this year&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; that he saw no reason against, and a good many reasons for, South African universities remaining predominantly either White or Black.</block>
<p>Then he developed his theory of &#x201C;elitism&#x201D;, an élite group which should be developed at universities. He said that people who did not think for themselves would say this was arrogance, conceit or snobbishness and he went on to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">But it could mean something different, something which was absolutely necessary for progress in general and of particular importance in South Africa at this stage.</block>
<p>He concluded by saying&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">To reject a policy of elitism in the sense in which I have been describing it, is to prefer a policy of equality to a policy of equal opportunity, and since men and women are not born and never will be equal &#x2026;</block>
<p>This means too that various nations&#x2014;this is the comparison he draws&#x2014;will never be equal. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<p>A highly enlightening article recently appeared in the newspapers and I hope that the official Opposition has also read it Hon. Senators will remember that the Coleman Commission&#x2014;Prof. Coleman of the University of Chicago was the chairman&#x2014;instituted a very comprehensive inquiry into the position of the Negro in America in the &#x2019;sixties. The commission eventually recommended in 1966 that the integration of the races should take place at school level and that the Negro be deliberately integrated in White schools. Now, after a decade, he has made a statement which has shaken the American Liberal Establishment to its foundations. I quote the following from a report&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Then last year Professor Coleman rocked the American Liberal Establishment by declaring his earlier report was based on mistaken premises.</block>
<p>He said&#x2014;</p>

<p>In other words, the man who is apparently the greatest authority in America in this sphere, confirms that compulsory integration at school and university level has been an absolute failure in the United States. We know that that is so in all spheres. That is why the ghettoes are on the increase in America, crime is increasing and the situation is anything but attractive.</p>
<p>I should also like to come a little nearer home while we have the opportunity. Hon. Senators are aware of the fact that immediately after independence Transkei established its university, and this year, a week or so ago, held its first graduation ceremony. On that occasion President Matanzima, who is the chancellor of the university, spoke with the greatest appreciation of the success of the university within its own national concept He laid the greatest emphasis on this. The same applies to Chief Minister Buthelezi of the Zulu nation, who is presently chancellor of the University of Zululand. A proud Zulu nationalist&#x2014;there is no doubt about this&#x2014;he too said recently during a speech in Soweto that Zulus throughout the country, wherever they might be found, were members of that Zulu nation. In the first place they must receive education within the cultural orientation of that nation and that was of primary importance. Even Bophuthatswana has already appointed a commission to investigate the possibility of establishing its own university. The ideal would definitely be for each of these groups to have its own university if that is possible.</p>
<p>These people support the policy of the NP, namely, that the university is there for the education and the moulding of the individual into a useful and worthwhile citizen of his own community. A university must be nationally oriented; this of course also applies to all other educational institutions. Therefore this is also the privilege of the Zulus and other national groups.</p>
<p>Then there is the interesting statement of Chief Minister Sebe at Potchefstroom a year or two ago when he stressed precisely the same aspect He said that people who wanted to group all Black people together purely because of their Black skin, ignored existing and indestructible ethnic differences. He then repudiated Mrs. Suzman&#x2019;s viewpoint, namely, that there should be desegregation and integration. He said as far as they were concerned there could be neither desegregation nor integration which, of course, means the same thing.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, true education is nationally oriented; it is founded on and directed at the national concept The education of a nation for its future existence and survival as a nation is the pride of each nation, its pearl of great price and its yardstick for dignity. The universities for Whites and non-Whites must remain nationally oriented universities, full-fledged educational institutions established for particular ethnic national groups. That is why our White tertiary educational institutions must also develop according to the cultural requirements of the various communities. That is why we have English universities and Afrikaans universities. There are even universities which try to promote a particular religious association. Nobody objects to anybody of a different language group studying at such a university on condition that the character of the university remains intact.</p>
<p>This proven principle of the NP will not be departed from in the slightest It is also the ideal and the aim of the Black nations in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do, however, wish to return to the matter which I raised with the hon. the Deputy Minister earlier.</p>
<p>†Sir, I must continue by asking him why the Government has not acquired this quota land that was promised between 30 and 40 years ago? I believe it is because the Government is obsessed with its ideology of apartheid; because of its obsession with the idea of independence for the homelands and because it accepts that in that independence lies its solution to the problems of South Africa. It is a solution which they are trying to foist on all the people in South Africa. And that is the answer to the hon. Senator Klopper, namely that they are foisting it on all the people of South Africa, Black and White, whether they want it or not Sir, I must say this to that hon. Senator &#x2026;</p>

<p>Order! I am interrupting the hon. Senator at this stage because I do not want any misunderstanding. It appears to me that under Vote No. 8 we can only debate the administration of matters pertaining to Black people in the White areas and the promotion of the development of the various Black national units towards self-determination.</p>
<p>Education can be discussed under Vote No. 40 which makes provision for the education of the Black population groups in the White areas of the Republic of South Africa. Their education is also the responsibility of this department Further aims of Vote No. 40 are to aid self-governing territories in the execution of the educational function and to render assistance to independent Black States in accordance with agreements concluded.</p>

Senator Klopper with whom I am sure I am going to join issue shortly in one by-election in Natal, in South Coast, with a possibility of a second by-election in Eshowe towards the end of the year, that I am quite prepared to debate with him at any time the demands of Chief Gatsha Buthelezi for the inclusion of Richards Bay and all that other land within an independent kwaZulu.

</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>No Sir, unfortunately not; my time is limited. Herein, Sir, lies the dilemma of this Nationalist Party Government, a dilemma which the hon. the Prime Minister has now acknowledged And it is for that reason that he has now announced that he is not going to be bound by the 1936 Trust and Land Act At the same time I must also remind the hon. Senator that that statement was contradicted by the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development, the hon. Dr. Piet Koornhof.</p>
<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has also made other statements and has now gone ahead with the expansion of the Plural Relations Commission and the establishment of a further commission and a number of regional committees that are to advise the Plural Relations Commission. But, Sir, out of the establishment of these bodies arise certain questions that have to be answered because of the uncertainty that is now being created, not only in the minds of Whites but in the minds of Blacks as well.</p>
<p>In 1975 this Parliament introduced certain proposals. They were opposed by us&#x2014;we were then the official Opposition in both Houses&#x2014;but they were passed and had the effect of settling the problems that many people faced; for instance, the uncertainty as to whether they would be incorporated or not, as to whether their land would be purchased or not Those problems were settled in 1975. Now the hon. the Prime Minister comes and reopens the whole festering sore and says: We are not going to be bound by that; we are going to have a look at something else.</p>
<p>But, Sir, what has happened in the debates in the Other Place? There the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development said we were bound by the 1975 proposals. In fact, he went so far as to say that he was going to implement them first I think this is the first question on which we demand an answer this afternoon from the hon. the Deputy Minister, Sir. Will they be bound by the 1975 proposals? Will they carry them out? Or are they going to scrap those in the hope that the Plural Relations Commission will submit a better plan in the middle of 1980?</p>
<p>The next question is whether additional finances will be made available and, if so, how much and when? There sits the hon. the Minister of Finance. I hope he will be able to tell us whether more finance will be made available.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Another question which requires an answer is, will all affected persons, Whites, Coloureds and Indians, whether they are farmers or urban dwellers, be bought out? Because we have certain plans that have been put forward, including this one in <i>To The Point</i>&#x2014;a grand plan of four Black areas carved out of the whole of the Republic of South Africa. And, Sir, while we are talking about that, I believe also that we need an answer to the question which is posed by the conflicting statements of the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development On the one hand the hon. the Prime Minister has said that he will be looking at any plans, including this one in <i>To The Point</i>, while, on the other hand, the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development has said that they are not going to consider any new proposals or any new maps that have been propagated by academics and others. I think those were the words that he used, Sir. Here again we have a conflict and people are now beginning to become concerned, both Black and White, because they want to know where their future lies. Another question which must be answered is that regarding the 1936 Land Act and its quotas, i.e. whether additional land will be made available to the homelands. There appears to have been conflict in the statements again of the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations.</p>
<p>A question which is being asked more and more by Whites, and particularly by Whites in Natal, is: Should Whites whose land is affected by consolidation be obliged to live under the jurisdiction of a Black government? In this plan in <i>To</i> <i>The Point</i> it is suggested that they should remain under the jurisdiction of the Black Government What people are asking today is: What is the end of the road? Where are we going? This Government must tell the country now what their plans are, where they think they are going. Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Blacks all demand to know the answer to these questions. Let us remove this uncertainty from the minds of the Whites, and let us remove the uncertainty from the minds of the Blacks as well.</p>
<p>These are some of the questions on the subject of land purchases and consolidation which require direct, clear, concise and unambiguous answers. As I know this hon. Deputy Minister, he usually does give that type of answer, and this afternoon we expect from him unambiguous answers to those questions which I have put to him. If he could not write the points down as quickly as I gave them to him, I shall send my notes over to him so that he will have time to have a look at them and to consider them.</p>
<p>I want to come to the second question, viz. the question of labour, the question of the application of influx control regulations. I must draw the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister to a screaming headline on the front page of <i>The Natal Mercury :</i> &#x201C;R500 threat to pirate bosses.&#x201D; I want to ask him as a man with whom I served for a long time on a commission, and whom I got to know well, whether he believes that this is the way to get co-operation from the people of South Africa, White people and Black; whether he believes that this is the way in which he must apply his influx control regulations, i.e. by threatening them with fines of R500 a time for every person they employ who is not registered?</p>

<p>Let me say that i this statement does not apply only in the Western Cape, where the hon. the Minister says he has a special problem. It applies to the whole of the Republic. He says that it is to be applied because influx control must be maintained at all costs. It is the costs I want to talk about this afternoon, because I believe that the application of the system in the way it is applied causes trouble, hatred, frustration to Black and White. It is not only the Black people who are frustrated by this; it is the White employers as well.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope I am not going to start a flutter in the dovecotes which will upset people, but I want to talk on the question of land to be granted to the Black areas. I know absolutely nothing about kwaZulu; I am speaking simply of the Transvaal. [Interjections.] What worries me is that I am afraid that our good agricultural land, which we are going to give to the Black people, will not be used beneficially. I have looked at the annual report of the Department of Education and Training, and I want to relate this to the beneficial use of land. It is clear from this report that insufficient attention has been given to agricultural training. I could make a number of quotations from the department&#x2019;s report in this connection. Perhaps I can do so later if I have sufficient time. But I do think it is of the greatest importance, not simply in the interests of the Black people in this country but in the interests of everybody that the best use should be made of that agricultural land. That is why I say that I think that agricultural training should be awarded a much higher priority by the other department which the hon. the Deputy Minister is responsible for than is the case at present.</p>
<p>In my part of the world there is good agricultural land and while there is no population pressure, land is still being purchased and is lying there unused. The agricultural value of that land is really being destroyed. That is why I feel that we as South Africans need have no guilty feelings about the question of what we give to the Black man and what we do not give him. I do not think we need have such a guilty feeling &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#havenga">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. D. HAVENGA</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Du Toit referred to the wonderful consolidation of the UP. They have consolidated in such a way that there are four groups of them. However, I do not want to say much about that, Sir.</p>
<p>In the short time at my disposal, Sir, I want to say something about the administration boards and community councils. When the NP came into power in 1948 the Black townships around the White cities were in a chaotic state. There were squatter camps in which some people lived under canvass and others in corrugated iron huts. The conditions there constituted a danger to both White and Black. The first task of the NP was to clear up those squatter camps. I have in mind places like Maroko, Newclare and many others. In those days the locations, as they were called, were still under the control of city councils. The Government had many problems, especially with those city councils that were not well disposed towards it. In this connection I can mention the City Council of Johannesburg. We had many problems with that city council in order to establish housing schemes there and to ensure that the money allocated to the city council for that purpose was correctly used. During the period 1960 to 1970 the Government established the Bantu Administration Boards. Large tracts of land were purchased and all the responsibilities of city councils in this connection were placed in the hands of these independent Bantu Administration boards. In the short time since their inception these administration boards have done a great deal for the Black people living round the White cities. Since 1969 14 administration boards have been established and those boards have had to see to the building of houses and the provision of various facilities for the Blacks such as schools, hospitals etc. They have done it and they have done it as well as any administrative body could possibly have done. However, it came to the notice of the Government that the Blacks who lived in those areas and not in the homelands wanted to run their own affairs and to see to the welfare of the areas in which they lived, with the result that the community councils were established two years ago. Five such community councils have already been established and they are doing excellent work. I want to mention some of the responsibilities of these Black people who have been elected by their own people and explain what the duties of these community councils, in fact, are. They are the allocation and administration of the letting of accommodation to single persons or to persons as if they were single; the allocation and administration of the letting of dwellings, buildings and other structures; the allocation and administration of sites for church, school or trading purposes; the approval of building plans of private dwellings and the removal or destruction of unauthorized or abandoned buildings or structures. The administration boards had many problems in connection with the destruction of this type of building and the community councils are now responsible for this. Other duties include the prohibition, regulation or restriction of the keeping of animals, except dogs; the control over the keeping of dogs and the imposition of a levy on the keeping thereof; the promotion of the moral and social welfare of persons living in its area; the promotion of sound community development in its area; the beautifying of and the neatness of the area; the administration of sport and recreational facilities; the administration of library services; the award of bursaries and the maintenance of services determined by the Minister. A community council may, furthermore, in terms of section 5(1)(b) to establish a control and manage a community guard for its area. It shall report to the Minister or the person acting under the authority of the Minister on any matter referred to it. It must make recommendations to the Minister or the administration board regarding the making and application of regulations which it deems necessary or desirable in the interests of the persons in its area. It must make recommendations to the authorities concerned in connection with transport services and it must make recommendations to the bodies concerned in respect of educational matters, including, in this regard, priorities in the erection of schools, the use of school buildings, sport and other facilities at schools and the use of donations for educational purposes. They have to perform numerous other duties but a very important duty that has been placed on these community councils is that they have to work out their own budget.</p>
<p>If money has to be found for the provision of improved services and so forth, they themselves, and not the Whites as was the case in the past, have to decide whether or not to increase house rentals. That is why I say that since 1948 this Government has moved forward step by step. It provided housing in the first instance, then it established the administration boards and it has now established the community councils which are looking after their own people in the White areas. The home-ownership scheme was introduced last year and in many cases Black people have already availed themselves of it, particularly in the Vaal Triangle. The Black people there have accepted it and are very happy about it.</p>
<p>I want to put two very important questions to the hon. the Minister in connection with the Vaal Triangle. At the moment there are still 6 823 Whites employed by the adminis tration boards. In view of the fact that all these duties are to be taken over by the community councils, can the hon. the Minister tell us what is to happen to those Whites in future? Many of them are worried. They do not know what is to become of them once all these duties are transferred to the Blacks as provided for in legislation.</p>
<p>We in the Vaal Triangle were promised by the former Minister, Mr. M. C. Botha, that the three Black towns situated in the White area, namely Sharpeville with 5 921 houses, Boiletong with 1 986 houses and Bophelong with 1 404 houses, would be moved to the Bantu administration area of Sebokeng. However, the administration board has recently started to provide electric power and other services even in Sharpeville where, as you know, Sir, we have had many problems in the past. I should like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister whether that promise of the past will still be honoured and, if so, when that will be. I realize that there is a severe housing shortage and it may not be an economic proposition at this stage to demolish 6 823, nearly 7 000, houses and to build others. However, the question is still whether this matter will be attended to in the near future.</p>
<p>I want to conclude by expressing our thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development and his two hon. Deputy Ministers. We are pleased that the hon. the Deputy Minister is with us today. We expect a great deal from him in future.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, it seems to me as though the hon. Senator Havenga went back to the runderpest of 1948. When he spoke about the squatter towns and the tent towns which existed at that time, I thought that I should like to ask him whether we do not still have our Crossroads today? And there is not only one of them. Do we not also have the position that the Black people who were removed from their places of residence in the rural areas are living in tent towns at the moment? Has he never been to one of those towns where they have lived in tents for months on end? They are still living in tents and the winter has already started. On the Natal Highveld this is once again the position today, and I shall discuss this with the hon. the Deputy Minister a little later.</p>
<p>†I was talking about the influx control system. I said that it was the application of this system which causes trouble, hatred and frustration for both Black and White people in this country. The hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development is reported to have said in the Other Place that if there is work and if there is a house, then you have the elements for a stable society. He said that this was what he wished for, a stable society, but that if either of these two elements was missing then one did not have the elements for a stable society, and under those circumstances one could not allow a worker to be registered. However, we find today that even where both elements are available, where there is employment that is satisfactory to the Black worker and where there is housing that is satisfactory to the Black worker, and where the employer is happy to have that person employed, one still cannot get him registered in one&#x2019;s name. I believe that this is one of the greatest frustrations and the biggest complaints against the application of this whole system.</p>
<p>I refer particularly to the system of zoning, where employers in a certain area are told that they may only employ persons from certain districts and where Black workseekers in certain districts are told that they may only seek employment in certain centres. This is denying them the fundamental right of selling their labour in the open market at the best reward. I believe it is a limitation which must be removed as soon as possible. One need only look at the problem that we have now, where certain firms and private individuals have employed persons from a particular district for 25 years or more. Now, when they require employees to replace those who are going to be pensioned off or are leaving for other reasons, they are told that they may not employ people from those particular districts because it is outside of their zoning. When it comes to the domestic sphere of employment in particular, even where there is employment offered, where there is satisfactory housing offered, so often the housewife is told, when she goes to the board to register that employee, that she cannot register him or her because she comes from the wrong area. At the moment thousands of people are illegally employed&#x2014;if that is the correct term; they are unregistered workers who are being employed. That is why we have this headline of what the hon. the Minister said.</p>

<p>They are all over the country, not only in the Western Province, not only in the Western Cape but throughout the country. They have accommodation and they have employment. They are satisfied with what they have. But the Government will not allow the legalization of the situation which exists where there is a satisfied employer and a satisfied employee. Now the hon. the Minister is going to use the big stick to try to break up that relationship between employer and employee. He is creating hostility, he is creating bad feeling, he is creating frustration, instead of attempting to gain their co-operation. Thousands of workers meet his requirements but they cannot be registered because of the red tape which is applied by the Government in their application of the influx control regulations.</p>
<p>I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister this afternoon&#x2014;I did think of demanding of him but I decided to appeal to him, to appeal to his sensibilities as a responsible person&#x2014;if he will not declare a moratorium today on all those employers who have unregistered Black employees who have been working for a period, who have proved that they are responsible workers, who have accommodation; in other words, all those people who meet the requirements of the hon. Dr. Piet Koornhof, the Minister of Plural Relations and Development. I want to ask him to declare a moratorium and allow those employers the opportunity to register those persons who today are being illegally employed because they are unregistered.</p>

<p>Are there thousands of Coloureds who are unemployed in Johannesburg, Durban and Bloemfontein? No, but there are thousands of Blacks all over the country who are unemployed. However, I believe that an action of this nature by this Government would gain tremendous goodwill from Black and White in this country. I also believe it would gain tremendous goodwill in the outside world. It would help to resolve the impasse which has been created by the manner in which influx control is applied. I want to repeat, Sir, the Blacks are satisfied with their employment. The Whites are happy to employ those Black employees. And what happens? The State denies, first of all, the Black man the right to be employed and secondly, it denies the White employer the right to employ those people. Why should the State interfere in these situations? The people are there; it is not as if we are going to have a tremendous influx of people. I am not pleading that thousands of people should be brought into the urban areas. I am not pleading for that. I am simply pleading for the regularization of a situation which pertains today and a situation which has pertained for many, many years.</p>
<p>Sir, I want to appeal again to the hon. the Deputy Minister. Declare a moratorium, Sir. Regularize the position of these thousands of people. I am not asking this for the Tsotsi&#x2019;s but for those who are in regular employment and who have been employed for a period and who have proved that they are responsible people, Sir. Use co-operation. Get the co-operation of both the employer and the employee instead of using the threads of force that have been used by his Minister. I must hasten to add that in terms of the NRP&#x2019;s philosophy our policy towards this matter is that we believe that one must maintain a system of influx control. We accept that one cannot open the floodgates in the interests of the protection of the settled Black communities within the urban areas.</p>
<p>However, like the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development, we believe that where there is employment as well as housing the employee should be allowed to come into the urban areas and should be allowed to be registered. We agree with the hon. the Minister, Sir, but we are asking him to make it easier for people to achieve that object.</p>
<p>Sir, as far as we are concerned, the administration of the influx control regulations should be left to the Black administrations in the urban areas as well as in the homelands. Sir, I am serious when I say that and I believe that in this way it will be applied humanely and in such a way that employers will be able to obtain all the labour they need and that employees will be able to sell their labour in the best market.</p>
<p>Sir, the last matter that I indicated I should like to discuss with the hon. the Deputy Minister is one that I discussed with him last year while he was Deputy Minister in a different section within the Department. I am referring to the question of the sale of sorghum beer. We have the situation at the moment that in terms of the Act the local authority&#x2014;i.e. the administration board concerned&#x2014;in a particular area has the sole right to distribute sorghum beer. I accept that principle but I believe it is being carried too far by certain of the administration boards that are interpreting this as the sole right to distribute only the beer which is produced by themselves. The result is that they are creating not only a monopoly of distribution &#x2014;which we accept&#x2014;in those areas but also a monopoly of supply. Sir, I believe the spirit of the Act, when it was passed by this Parliament, was that the administration board concerned should have the sole right to distribute but that it should also distribute the beer of other neighbouring administration boards and authorities which produce beer.</p>
<p>In Natal we have the situation where the Drakensberg Administration Board, Port Natal Administration Board and the kwaZulu Government all produce beer. There are four popular brands of sorghum beer, and they are known as uKahlamba, uBejane, Isiko and Juba. These brands are produced by these three different boards. As with the Whites, Sir, there is a demand &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Sir, the appeal made by the hon. Senator in respect of influx control, is as irresponsible as it could ever be. The hon. Senator alleges, firstly, that there are Black people who have accommodation but who cannot register for employment. But that is not the position, Sir. If he has accommodation, he is there illegally. He cannot get accommodation until he has been registered as a workseeker in the town or city concerned. When hon. Senators talk about influx control I am reminded of the old UP days. Do you remember the squatter camps we had in those days, Sir? Just think of the maladministration we had in those days! [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Like Crossroads!</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#jager">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. R. DE JAGER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, like Crossroads. It came into existence, I think, because influx control was not exercised strictly enough. That is why legislation will be introduced to increase the penalties. The Whites are equally guilty, Sir. I know of a case in Johannesburg where a building contractor was caught employing 54 workers illegally. I know what I am talking about; I move in the industrial sphere. Nine out of ten workseekers who knock at our doors are illegal workseekers. They have no right to be in the area. The result is that those who are there legally are unemployed. The illegal workseekers deprive the others of employment.</p>
<p>Sir, we have no option but to apply influx control. We have to apply it strictly. There are thousands of people in Johannesburg looking for work and they are the ones who become Tsotsi&#x2019;s. The hon. Senator also said that his appeal was not to protect the Tsotsi&#x2019;s. The Tsotsi&#x2019;s in the big cities are there legally; they did not come in from outside in order to find work. There are exceptions, however, namely, those who come here and eventually have to resort to theft in order to live. Sir, do you know where the people come from who flock to the cities and cannot register? Ninety-nine per cent of them come from the platteland. They come from the farmers. His father lives there, he grows up and then he comes to the city to look for work. Because if they come from the homelands they can register. We have the homelands which supply the various towns with labour. If the person is legally there and finds employment, he can register. I have registered many of them. I go to Daveyton and take the Black worker with me. First of all I obtain his forms from Johannesburg and then he gets registered there. There is no problem. If people would only take the trouble to go through the right channels they can register workers from the homelands. That applies to domestic servants, building workers etc. One must, however, go through the right channels.</p>
<p>A stage is then reached when the authorities decide that there are too many people. Then the registration of new workers is stopped for some time because there are enough people to do the work. Sir, I think it is a very good principle to increase the fines. The matter now rests in the hands of the White man; he is the person who encourages unlawfulness. One cannot blame the Black man; he wants work and does not care how he gets it. It is the White man who knows full well that he is contravening the law. If a fine of R100 does not stop him from doing so, one must see whether an increased fine will help. I do not think we enforce our influx control measures strictly enough in some cases. I welcome the legislation which increases the fine because a person will henceforth think twice before he employs anyone illegally, although it will still happen.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator also spoke about consolidation. That does not affect the Black man alone; it also affects the White man. If the commission does not recommend more land, everyone will know more or less that at some time or other his farm will be taken over. That poses certain problems for the owner. I myself have experienced that. It deprives one of all initiative to develop one&#x2019;s farm. One loses all desire to carry on because one does not know when it will be one&#x2019;s own turn. It would have been better had there been some kind of time-table. I think the position is more difficult for the White land-owner than it is for the Black man. Somebody said, for example, that some of the land was being farmed by Whites. On the other hand again the hon. Senator Du Toit said there were vast areas of land that were not being utilized. It is for the specific reason that the land must be utilized that it is leased to Whites. We know, for example, that in the agricultural sphere, the Black man is developing at a slow pace. In fact, it rests with the Whites to provide the infra-structure and it is for them to see to it that development takes place as quickly as possible. Development cannot take place quickly enough, Sir. People are developing too slowly. There must also be proper development. There must be planning. As a result large areas of land are not being used and as far as this is concerned, I agree with the hon. Senator Du Toit. The land that can be utilized by Whites is leased to them by the Government. That is only right.</p>
<p>Sir, the hon. Senator also referred to those people who are being moved and who have to live in tents. At Hammanskraal, in the Cullinan district there are a number of Ndebele&#x2019;s who do not want to live under their tribal authority. When land was first purchased round about October last year, they moved in and erected houses. They moved in at such a rate that the administration could not keep pace. The administration worked practically day in and day out in order to establish a town about a mile further on, and then the people were to be moved there but, before they could start doing so, the town was also full. If my memory serves me correctly, there were something like 7 000 families there. They moved in on their own; they were not moved. They simply refused to live among the others; they wanted to be on their own. That town was already full before they had started to plan the other one and at that stage already people were streaming in. I own a farm in the vicinity and that appears on the list. When I went there recently I found that those people were already laying out a township although the farm had not yet even been bought. This happens because the town is not built quickly enough so that the people who want to move in of their own free will can obtain accommodation. As far as consolidation is concerned, Sir, I think the farmers who will be affected by it, the public too, White and non-White, in fact, everybody in South Africa, will be happy if that could happen tomorrow and the matter finalized. We shall all be pleased if it can be finalized in such a way that everyone affected will be satisfied, because I do not think consolidation is taking place fast enough.</p>
<p>The hon. the Prime Minister is alleged to have said that more land will be given to the homelands. I do not think the hon. the Prime Minister said that. He said that he did not think the 1936 legislation need be the end of the story. That then is also why one of the terms of reference of the commission is to obtain details in this connection and to make recommendations. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat reminds me of those people who do not move with the times. One thing is uppermost in their minds and that is influx control. They do not move with the times and are blind to the changes that are taking place in the country, changes that are being brought about by the Government. However, I do not want to dwell on that and would rather say a few words in connection with another matter mentioned by the hon. Senator, namely, the purchase of White farms for the Black areas, as well as moving people from one area to another.</p>
<p>I am really on my feet this afternoon, Sir, to elaborate on a matter I raised towards the end of April. On 26 April, when we were discussing the first report of the Select Committee on Plural Relations, I tried to correct an incorrect statement in connection with the sudden expropriation of land in the district of Thaba Nchu that had been made in the Other Place on 15 February this year. Because I was asked to make my speech as short as possible just before the debate started, I was unable to get to the crux of the matter. I am sorry that the hon. Chief Whip is not listening because it affects him, in fact.</p>
<p>It was alleged in the Other Place, for example, that the land that had to be purchased in terms of the 1936 legislation, had all been purchased in the Witzieshoek area, that area which is known as Qwa Qwa today, and not at Thaba Nchu as originally intended. The previous day, 25 April, I availed myself of the opportunity to question the official who had attended the sitting of the Select Committee of the Senate in connection with the extent of the land purchased in the Thaba Nchu district in terms of the 1936 legislation. The reply I got was very definite that seven-eigths of the land purchased in terms of the 1936 legislation had been purchased at Thaba Nchu</p>
<p>The hon. member of Parliament who gave the wrong impression in the Other Place&#x2014;I will not put it stronger than that&#x2014;maintained that all of the 80 000 morgen had been purchased in the area known as Qwa Qwa today while no land had been purchased in the Thaba Nchu district. Then he said he hoped that Thaba Nchu would be prepared to relinquish the 25 000 ha that had now to be purchased for the new purpose in view of the fact that their parliamentary representative at the time, namely 1936, had made such a promise. Mr. Chairman, as you know, I am not allowed to quote for the Hansard of an hon. member of the Other Place but here I have the words he used.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:</from>
<p>May I reply to that question at a later stage, Sir? The hon. member said the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Ek hoop dat Thaba Nchu sy woord gestand sal doen soos dit 43 jaar gelede deur sy verteenwoordiger hier uitgespreek is, t.w. dat Thaba Nchu tevrede daarmee sal wees.</block>
<p>But the hon. member&#x2019;s facts were wrong, Sir. I have just indicated that the officials of the department have confirmed that seven-eighths of the Trust land in terms of the 1936 legislation, land that had to be purchased in the Orange Free State, had in fact been purchased in the Thaba Nchu district. Secondly, those purchases were concluded in the normal way of concluding negotiations between seller and buyer, the State in this case. The position is totally different now. The land is being expropriated. I do not want to revert to the question as to whether or not Parliament had the right to pass the Expropriation Act; that is by the way. The land is being expropriated and the owners are compelled to sell their land. Some of the owners recently expressed their serious concern in the Press. Unfortunately, I do not have the newspaper cutting with me, but I take it that many of the hon. Senators also saw it. A photograph appeared in one of the newspapers of a woman who expressed her and her husband&#x2019;s condemnation of such a transaction in strong terms. Other families too expressed strong disapproval of conducting business in such a manner. The land is first expropriated and, what is worse, because the Government is in a hurry, occupation ié taken before the question of compensation has been finalized. And what are the conditions of sale, Sir? Forty percent in cash and 60% in Government stock. And the Government stock can only be discounted at a loss. Most of the people whose land is being expropriated must surely start somewhere else. How must they pay for the new land that they can purchase under this scheme? That is all I wanted to say in connection with this matter, Sir.</p>
<p>Before I go on to the next point I just want to ask the hon. Deputy Minister whether he is satisfied that the owners of expropriated land are fairly treated when through expropriation they lose the land they have inherited, especially in view of the fact that the transaction is not conducted in a normal business-like manner?</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in the short time left to me I want to return to an argument advanced by the hon. Senator Van Rensburg when he spoke shortly after I had raised this matter that day. His strongest argument was that he was there at the time and that he had had a great deal to do with the farms concerned, i.e. the seventh-eighths of the area to which I have just referred. He said that in those days the owners of the farms concerned were satisfied with the compensation of £14&#x2014;not rands, it was £ 14&#x2014;that they were offered for their farms. I did not interject while he was speaking, but I just wondered whether the hon. Senator Van Rensburg had not forgotten something. His objection was that there were people today who were dissatisfied with the money offered them and, if I remember correctly, he mentioned the figure of between R140 and R165 per morgen. Those were the figures mentioned by the hon. Senator.</p>

<p>Let us take the year 1940. The legislation was passed in 1936 and the land was not purchased immediately. Let us take the year 1940 as an average for that period. At that time the rand was worth 100 cents. When we look at 1978 in this table&#x2014;we are now in the year 1979&#x2014;we see that a rand is worth 16 cents. So when one speaks of £ 14 in the years 1936-&#x2019;40, Sir, and compares that with R140, R150 or R160 today and calculates what the rand is worth today, one knows exactly where one stands.

<p>I rise, Sir, merely to express surprise that on this day in May 1979 the Opposition&#x2014;including the hon.

<p>When? Mr. Chairman, when he asks &#x201C;when&#x201D; I can only draw his attention to the spectacular progress that has been made over the past few years in regard to the political, humanitarian and territorial development of the various races. When the hon. Senator Webber laughs he is failing to appreciate the facts before his eyes. He talks about criminal neglect in respect of a few thousand hectares of land. Let us consider the position since 1952 when a start was made with the establishment of Bantu authorities, and the political evolution of those people since then. More than a thousand of those bodies have since been established. More than 160 local authorities have been established in Black urban areas in White areas. It is a process of political evolution unparalleled in any part of the world. This process will continue in a spirit of greater goodwill and greater determination to achieve even greater things jointly, in consultation, through hard work and negotiation. Reference has been made to consolidation. The hon. the Deputy Minister who is responsible for consolidation has walked miles and miles through the whole of South Africa to inspect every piece of land that could possibly be expropriated. Where else will one find such dedicated people, Sir? Where else will one find someone with such an intimate knowledge of both the needs and the problems of those people? Where else in the world will one find someone more determined to solve those problems? I honestly cannot understand how it is possible that people can still today advance old hackneyed arguments and ask where we are going and what has happened to the apartheid &#x201C;pipe-dream&#x201D; of the National Party Government? [Interjections.] It is not a &#x201C;pipe-dream&#x201D;, Sir, it is a reality. There are eight Black states in South Africa today, two of which are sovereign independent states. The rest of the world refuses to recognize them officially, for understandable reasons, but they do recognize their existence. The day will come when the rest of the world will have to recognize the sovereign independence of those states as well.</p>
<p>We are assisting these developed and developing Black areas, Black states, by means of White guidance, White expertise, White consultation, White determination and White finance&#x2014;millions of rands&#x2014;to develop into a constellation of states in Southern Africa that will lay the foundation for prosperous and happy states in Southern Africa.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, we must really engender in our people, particularly our Black people who have problems&#x2014;and I do not blame them for making ambiguous statements sometimes&#x2014; the necessary desire and encouragement to take part in this magnificent, productive and creative process that is taking place in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. Senator spoke quite as though he was an original old UP supporter. As far as kwaZulu is concerned, Sir, I said very clearly that I had no knowledge of kwaZulu. I want to point out to him, however, that before he became Minister of Finance, the hon. Senator Horwood himself admitted that kwaZulu did not have enough land. He told them that they should just exercise a little patience and that they would ultimately get Richards Bay. [In- terjections.] You should discuss that with him. I think in fact, that there is a reason why the hon. Senator talks about more land for kwaZulu. I spoke exclusively about my part of the world. After all, his colleague, the hon. Senator D. F. de Jager, has just said what I said, namely, that as far as unutilized land was concerned, the NP had once again applied the policy of the old UP. [Interjections.] Sir, hon. Senators do not want to listen. The NP applied the old UP policy by allowing White capital and initiative into the homelands. [Interjections.] Where does the hon. Senator get that from? The hon. Senator De Jager said that. Whites are now allowed to lease land there on a long-term basis in order to utilize it productively. That hon. Senator sits in the Carlton Hotel every Saturday afternoon drinking coffee&#x2014;he does not know anything about the platteland. That is his problem. If the hon. Senator would just go into the matter, he might also decide to go and farm with cattle in the homelands. We can then perhaps discuss the whole question with one another. Sir, that land is leased to Whites on condition that they develop it in such a way that the Black people are involved so that they can eventually take over. [Interjections.] Surely that is old UP policy. Has the hon. Senator now become an old UP supporter? Is he afraid to admit that that is so? Did the hon. Senator want to ask a question?

<p>Very well, Sir. I will be careful what I say, otherwise I may say something that will not be to the credit of the clerical profession and the hon. the Deputy Minister may take exception to it.</p>
<p>I want to draw serious attention to the fact that as far as the educational policy of the department is concerned, I think greater emphasis should be placed on agricultural training. It is true and I want to repeat this&#x2014; the NP is beginning to accept this&#x2014;that it is old UP policy that as many Black people as possible should be settled in the homelands, the independent states as they are today. I think the best way in which those areas can be developed, is to develop their agricultural potential. I am perturbed because the sister department of the department we are discussing at the moment is not giving more attention to the training of agriculturists. I can quote numerous passages from the annual report but I shall not do so. You might rule me out of order, Sir, if I did, and tell me that we were not discussing the Education Vote now. However, when one looks at the figures in the report, one notices that few agriculturists are being trained. I think there are only three agricultural high schools outside the independent Black states. It is hoped to established three more in the near future. I think greater emphasis should be placed on this type of education because we are faced with the problem of unemployment, and it is impossible for us to provide those people with jobs in the so-called White areas. I think, therefore, that the agricultural potential of the Black areas should be developed to the utmost. We should see to it that that is done. Not only is that in the interests of the Whites but it is also in the interests of the Blacks. It affects their future. Sir, we cannot get away from the fact that unless we make proper use of the agricultural potential of South Africa there will be famine in the near future and the people who will be the first to suffer will be the Black people in those areas. *Senator J.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I could not hear properly what the hon. Senator Du Toit said about wool and so forth. However, I want to tell him a story about a merino ram and an Afrikaner bull that tackled one another. I heard this story from a very reliable old gentleman. This is not a wild story; it is the gospel truth. After the second butt the red Afrikaner bull ran away.</p>
<p>I want to deal with another matter raised by the hon. Senator Du Toit and that is in connection with Thaba Nchu and the consolidation of Bophuthatswana. Bophuthatswana wanted the area round Thaba Nchu. An exchange offer was made but they said that because the spirits of their forefathers were there and because of other reasons they were not interested in an exchange. It happened to be a piece of land which was the most distant from their other land and so the Opposition must not blame the Government for the fact that there has not been consolidation in this specific instance.</p>
<p>I want to refer to what the hon. Senator Webber said. Sir, I cannot help but think that he spoke about apartheid in the bad sense of the word, as though the rich English language could not provide him with a proper translation of the Afrikaans term &#x201C;afsonderlike ontwikkeling&#x201D; (separate development). The word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; has become a swear word in the languages of the world &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#joubert">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. J. JOUBERT</person>:</from>
<p>No, we are not pained. [Interjections.] But it hurts me to think that an Opposition can be so irrespon sible as to exploit a situation and to give a bad meaning to a word that has a very positive meaning. That makes one sad.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator went on to speak about &#x201C;carved out&#x201D;. It is terrible to think that this beautiful country of ours has to be carved up. I doubt whether he knows what is happening in this country, how our policy of separate development and homelands development is being successfully implemented. That policy is being applied more widely every day and is very successful. In the eyes of the world he is denigrating an experiment that has been a great success hitherto. That is what makes me so sad. Such senseless action naturally hurts one.</p>
<p>I want to refer to the remarks made by my good friend the hon. Senator Oelrich about expropriation. Nobody likes the idea of expropriation but I think he ought to know what the position is in Thaba Nchu, namely, that there is some tension between the Tswanas and the Sothos living there. The land was expropriated because agreement could not be reached as to the price and the purchase of the land as such The hon. Senator ought also to know that the land is being revalued. But in the meantime something has to be done. The Government is not asleep as far as this is concerned, and these things have to be done. Neither do we live in the past like the hon. Senator Du Toit who today is still dreaming about the old UP. We do the things that have to be done and the things that are right [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I also want to refer to the comparison he drew between the value of money today and what land costs today. If I remember the figures correctly, he spoke about R28 or £14 in 1940 and about R160 at present. I have never been very good at arithmetic but if my calculation is correct the ratio is 1 to 5,7 in one case and in the other case, the depreciated value of money is 1 to 6,3. The two are therefore very close together. As I have said, the land is being revalued and the matter put right.</p>
<p>Sir, I am enjoying the privilege of being able to talk on such an important matter as the one before us today. However, I want to repeat that it is a pity that the Opposition&#x2019;s approach to it is so negative. I have the privilege of having many friends in various parts of the world and I like talking to them. My biggest task is to right the wrong that is</p>
<p>done by the English-language Press and its adherents, the Opposition, and the wrong impressions that were again created this afternoon by the hon. Senator Webber because of the sense in which he referred to &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; and his reference to &#x201C;carved up&#x201D;, etc. [Interjections.] Yes, quite right &#x201C;aparthate&#x201D; as well, because one also hears that word. I regard it as a privilege because our policy is the easiest policy to sell to the world. It is a just and fair policy. [Interjections.] I did not interrupt hon. Senators when they were speaking. I shall be pleased if they will allow me to make my speech. We have friends all over the world and, if they are correctly informed, they will remain our friends. I have no difficulty in disabusing their minds of all the wrong impressions that the English-language Press and the Opposition have created.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. J. JOUBERT</person>:</from>
<p>We are hot the only ones who have to pay such a high price for it today. I think all this is so unnecessary. We must consider the complex composition of South Africa&#x2019;s population and the potentially explosive situation inherent in it. We are a happy country, we are a privileged country and we should count our blessings. We have tremendous potential. If we had a responsible Opposition and if the world only knew what was really happening here, it is not difficult to imagine how different our position would have been. [Interjections.] No, according to our system of government there has to be an Opposition, but not an Opposition as irresponsible as this one. I have never yet been apologetic about our policy. That has never been necessary. It is a policy that one can be proud to sell because there is nothing in it to make one hang one&#x2019;s head in shame.</p>
<p>I have said that we have friends outside South Africa and that there are many of them. The most important friends that the 4&#x00BD; million Whites of South Africa have, however, are the almost 20 million Blacks, Coloureds and Indians. Our interests are the same. We know that friendship at international level is mostly determined by self-interest. But it so happens that our interests here are the same. Therefore they are potentially, and I do believe in reality as well, our best friends. If the 25 million of us here in South Africa will stand together in what we are doing&#x2014;and we are making progress in that direction&#x2014;and if we can establish the right relationship among ourselves, we shall become a force which the world will have to take into account. Sound human relationships is a basic requisite and a condition if we want to make a success of this. I think it is the duty of every one of us to promote a sound relationship.</p>
<p>As far as the past is concerned, we have a great deal to be thankful for, particularly in view of the fact that our forefathers set land aside here in South Africa for the various Black people. We went further, however, and introduced the 1936 legislation. The purchase of six million hectares of land is without precedent in the entire world. I want to quote a few details which the hon. Deputy Minister, Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg, recently gave, as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The land that has been purchased is greater than Taiwan and Israel together. Approximately as many people &#x2026;</block>
<p>i.e. approximately 20 million people&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; live in these two countries as all the Blacks, Coloureds and Indians in this country.</block>
<p>Let us have a look at another country, America, for example, which is more or less 7&#x00BD; times as big as South Africa. They also happen to have 20 million Negroes who own 1&#x00BD; million ha of land. They are the people who have such a lot to say about us. Some people say 13% of South Africa belongs to the Blacks, which is not true. Hon. Senators know that is so. That is not the position in greater Southern Africa. The Opposition and the English-language Press are also silent about the fact that the Blacks own the best parts of the country, the parts with the highest rainfall. The Whites who came to Southern Africa were very privileged in that they brought Christian civilization to those of another colour in this country. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to refer to something the hon. Senator Van Schoor said in his speech. He spoke about the millions of rands of White capital that were being spent in the homelands and the White expertise that was being turned to account there. The trouble is that the homelands would have been able to provide many more jobs had the Government listened to this Opposition and allowed White capital to develop those homelands and thereby to provide the people with work. For how many years did the Government not oppose that? White capital has only recently been allowed there. Had that not been allowed, those homelands would never have been in the position financially to develop. We gave the Government sound advice but they ignored it.</p>
<p>I want to refer now to the hon. Senator Joubert. I know that the Nationalists are very sensitive about the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; these days, but they themselves coined that word. It was used for the first time in the 1948 election and was used for a long time afterwards. Then they began to feel ashamed of the word and tried to get away from it. Unfortunately, when something has been in existence for over 30 years, it is not so easy to get rid of it. I can assure hon. Senators that even if we forget about it in this country it will take a very long time before the world outside forgets about it. I may tell hon. Senators that it is laughable to hear how it is sometimes pronounced. One hears &#x201C;appertiet&#x201D; for example. But no matter how they pronounce the word, the world knows what it means.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Joubert said that the Opposition and the Press misrepresented the position but many of the remarks made by Ministers do us far greater harm than what is said in debates here in Parliament. In any case the Opposition does not get so much publicity that what they say can cause any harm.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator said also that foreign countries were not properly informed otherwise they would support us. But what did the Department of Information do with the millions of rands that it spent? Surely it was their duty to inform those countries. Sir, I can assure you that when I go overseas I try to enlighten people to the best of my ability and to put South Africa in the best light possible. Now that the Wiehahn and the Riekert reports have more or less been accepted it will be much easier for us to put South Africa in a better light and I shall do my utmost in that respect.</p>
<p>†Mr. Chairman, I should like to welcome the move of the hon. the Minister of Co-operation and Development. We must try to get used to these new names because this Department&#x2019;s name has been changed so many times, but I will try my best. I am very pleased that the hon. the Minister has invited Dr. Motlana, Mr. Percy Qoboza and Bishop Tutu to have discussions with him and to become members of regional councils. It is regrettable, however, that Dr. Motlana has declined to co-operate. None the less the hon. the Minister made the correct move. One can understand that these people may feel bitter because they were imprisoned for five months recently and also served a previous sentence. However, I think they might change their minds at a later stage when they realize that the hon. the Minister is changing his attitude and that the Government is changing its attitude in regard to the Blacks.</p>
<p>I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to tell us more about the passes the Blacks have to carry. In the no-confidence debate in February, the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development&#x2014;the name has been changed since&#x2014;said that the passes carried by Blacks would be scrapped and would be replaced by documents similar to those used by the Whites. Later on it was reported that the &#x201C;dompas&#x201D;&#x2014;as the Blacks call it&#x2014;would be replaced by other documents. I should like to know whether any steps have been taken in this regard and approximately how long it will take before these passes are substituted by more acceptable documents. This is causing a great deal of bitterness among the Blacks and it does not surprise me because I read in a report in <i>The Daily Mail</i> of 6 April that an amount of R659 903 had been paid in fines for pass offences in the West Rand Administration Board are alone. I am sure the attitude of the Blacks towards the Whites will change if we can replace the passes with a more acceptable document and if this system can be applied more humanely. I am afraid many of these changes have been left to a very late stage. I welcome every change for the better. However, it is a great pity that this was not done earlier. I can assure those hon. Senators who try to belittle the old UP that if Gen. Smuts had been a younger man and had been still alive and in power, things would have looked much different today; we would have had far less bitterness and animosity towards the Whites.</p>

<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, we welcome the Wiehahn and the Riekert reports. Their recommendations are going to assist the Blacks to obtain better positions and receive better training and will enable them to be apprenticed. However, there is one thing we must remember. When more avenues are open to people and when they earn better incomes, they also develop much higher expectations. Now is the time for the hon. the Deputy Minister and his Department to act in this regard and as speedily as possible. In March this year it was reported that Soweto had a water supply for only 12 hours, on average, at a stretch. It was also reported that R12 million had been spent on water in Soweto but that there is great wastage because of broken pipelines and other factors. It was estimated that the loss amounted to something like R2,4 million per annum. There should be more efficient supervision in this regard because water is a scarce commodity in South Africa and, particularly after a year of severe drought, we cannot afford to lose that amount of water irrespective of the costs that may be involved.</p>
<p>There is also the question of the overloading of the sewerage system. It is estimated that it will cost about R2 million to have the system working properly. The people are not going to be satisfied with this kind of inefficiency in the townships and the position will have to be improved.</p>
<p>They also want better roads. There is a great complaint about &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers spoke about the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;. I have already said that &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; had a very positive meaning when it was first coined. But as time went by a bad meaning was given to that word. However, that is not the only word that has assumed a different meaning. There was a time when it was regarded as an honour to address a Black man as &#x201C;outa&#x201D; and a Black woman as &#x201C;aia&#x201D;. Today, however, those words have become terms of abuse and anyone who knows the Black people will never refer to them as &#x201C;aia&#x201D; or &#x201C;outa&#x201D;. To the Black man &#x201C;aia&#x201D; is a baboon. I am merely giving this as an example of how the meaning of words can change. The only &#x201C;aia&#x201D; that I hear about these days is the Ayatollah. There are no longer such things as &#x201C;aia&#x2019;s&#x201D; in South Africa.</p>
<p>It is for the very reason that the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; has been given the wrong connotation that it has been replaced by another more descriptive word. People who are still living in the past of 40 or 50 years ago have stuck to their ideas. They are still acting as maliciously as they did in those days and are still talking about &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; today without even knowing how to spell it correctly sometimes.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, reference has been made to the former Department of Information and the fact that it failed to enlighten the world. It surprises me, Sir, that people can be so naïve as to think that that department had sufficient funds at its disposal to enlighten the world, especially in view of the hostile attitude of the world towards South Africa.</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t want to talk about that, Sir. The Opposition can talk about nothing else but the Information episode. It is like a disease with them. They can only talk about <i>The Citizen.</i> We are talking about the propaganda that the former Department of Information made overseas. It is a very big task for a small country like South Africa to enlighten the world; as a matter of fact, it is an impossible task Apart from that, it has to be done in the face of UN opposition, a UN that is dominated by communism and a Third World that is following suit. Over and above that, there were the distorted and misrepresented facts that were disseminated from South Africa by the English-language Press, SAPU and the Opposition that made the task of this department more or less impossible.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want now to return to my prepared speech. We brought Western technology to Southern Africa and it is not surprising therefore, to find that there is positive development in the homelands while there is retrogression in many countries of the world, especially in most countries in Africa. Transkei, for example, has had a growth rate of 8% over the past few years.</p>
<p>South Africa has a very big task to perform, Sir, but we are achieving success. No fewer than <i>5</i>&#x00BD; million Black children are attending school today, i.e. almost 20% of the Black population. This percentage compares favourably with the number of children at school in Europe. But not a word is said about this being a positive policy. It is true that the standard of education of the White child and the facilities available to him differ from those of the Black child and, when that is referred to, it is presented as a form of discrimination against the Black man. It is physically impossible, however, to provide the Black and White child with educational facilities of the same standard because the essential ingredients, such as teachers and funds, are lacking. However, this is not the only country where there is inequality as far as this is concerned. One finds that the living and educational standards of the Eskimo&#x2019;s in the northern parts of the Scandinavian countries are much lower than those in the highly developed Scandinavian countries. This is also true in the case of the Maori&#x2019;s in New Zealand, the aborigines in Australia and the Negroes in America. We are not happy with the position, Sir, and it will be rectified in due course. But those are the hard facts of life.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the position today is that this small White population in South Africa, assisted by the contributions made by the Black, Coloured and Indian people, has succeeded in providing the best health and hospital services in Africa. We also have the largest number of hospital beds per 10 000 of the population on the whole continent.</p>
<p>As far as housing is concerned, in spite of the limited means at its disposal, this country has for years embarked on housing projects that are unparalleled in the world. I speak under correction, Sir, but I think it was stated recently that 190 houses were being completed per day at the enormous cost of R600 million per annum.</p>

<p>Yes, I suppose the hon. Senator Winchester would have preferred the hovels to remain whereas we preferred to build new houses. It is not only in South Africa, however, that one finds hovels. There are hovels and places like Crossroads in the rest of Africa and throughout the world. A quarter of the people in beautiful Rio live in hovels. So this is not something that is peculiar to South Africa. The hon. Senator is looking at South Africa with a jaundiced eye; he only sees her faults.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in conclusion I want to refer to the role the farmers of this country play in respect of race relations between Black and White. In this respect, I think the farmers are setting a very good example to the rest of the population. The 75 000 farmers employ almost one-third of the available Black labour in the country. We take it for granted that we have to provide our workers with housing. I admit that the housing is not always what it should be but great progress is being made in improving it. Farm-workers work under healthy conditions. They are in the open air the whole day, they get sufficient, wholesome food and their children attend school. I do not think the farmers are given sufficient credit for what they do on their farms as far as the education of Black children is concerned. There is a sound human relationship at personal level on the farms. The children play &#x201C;klei-osse&#x201D; together and when they grow bigger they play rugby together, and all of this is conducive to more healthy relationships. There is constant difficulty in the city to try to put the sports policy on a sound basis, but there is no such problem on the farm. We grow up together, we talk to one another, there is dialogue. We experience the bitter and the sweet in each other&#x2019;s lives.</p>
<p>If you will permit me, Sir, to refer to my own small farming operations, I can tell you that there are approximately 35 families comprising 250 persons living on my farm. I discovered recently that a quarter of them owned motor-cars. The percentage owning motor-cars is higher than in the case of Russia. Our doors are open 24 hours a day and if anybody takes ill and needs attention they can always come to us. That is the position on all the farms, of course. There is not an hour in the day or night when we cannot be called upon for assistance. Even at night they knock on our bedroom window when someone has taken seriously ill or when there has been an accident. One often has to rush to town or to hospital with that sick person.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I trust that the farmers will make better use of the in-service training facilities because this will be of great benefit to the farmer himself as well as to the Black man. In this age of mechanization where expensive equipment such as tractors, etc. is used, it is important that the workers are properly trained. Many of them subsequently return to their homelands and I think they learn a great deal from the farmer as far as farm management and the maintenance of equipment like tractors and so forth is concerned.</p>
<p>We are in the fortunate position that these farm labourers talk about &#x201C;our sheep&#x201D; on the farms, seeing that the hon. Senator Du Toit so often talks about sheep. My farm labourers (volk) talk about &#x201C;our sheep, master; our sheep are in good condition.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very sorry that the hon. Senator Joubert distorted my words. I want to say that I said that I would always defend South Africa but that it would perhaps be easier now as a result of the Wiehahn and the Riekert reports. I shall not waste any more time on him.</p>
<p>†Mr. Chairman, the other matter I want to raise is the question of housing. I know that in the budget this year R50 million has been set aside for housing, but that is far from adequate because there are so many homes required in the townships. The position is also that there are many Black people today who want to buy their own homes because certain employers and building societies are prepared to help them. But the building societies complain that people cannot buy because the land surveyors have to first visit the properties to delimitate the boundaries before the properties can be acquired. Mr. Sceales said that the building societies are becoming quite frustrated. I think this matter should be expedited. First of all, the people could not buy their homes. Then there were great expectations when it was announced that they would be allowed to buy their homes on a 99-year leasehold basis. I am sure that long before the 99 years are up there will be freehold title for all. But the position is that we should expedite these matters and not frustrate these people. If they want to buy, let them put their money in homes rather than spend it on other unnecessary things.</p>
<p>Another question I would like the hon. Deputy Minister to give us some information on is electrification. At one time it was in an advanced stage of planning, loans were available and they could electrify, but nothing has happened so far. There may be cogent reasons for this but I think we are entitled to know what the position is and when this is expected to take place.</p>
<p>The other matter I want to refer to is Black taxation. Yesterday I heard somebody complain that the Blacks are paying very little tax and that the Whites have to carry most of the tax burden. But the reason for this is that the Whites, particularly the Government, were responsible for stopping the advancement of</p>
<p>Blacks to skilled jobs where they could earn more and so, of course, contribute more. But I am sure that within the next five or six years, when the recommendations of the Wiehahn report have been implemented, the Blacks will be able to earn far more, they will also be able to contribute more tax and the tax burden will be more evenly distributed.</p>
<p>The Whites must go out of their way, in my opinion, in order to safeguard themselves, to allow the Blacks to share skills, to earn more and to show them that the private enterprise system can offer everything to the largest portion of the population, whether they be Black or White. Unless we make our present system more attractive, I am afraid we are going to experience very, very difficult times in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you will forgive me if I do not discuss ideologies today. I should like to talk about the development of the Black areas in my part of the world. Two large Black towns have been established at Tzaneen with all modern conveniences except electricity which is now being laid on. Those towns were built for the Shangaans and the North Sotho&#x2019;s. Numbers of new schools have been built for the Black people living in the area from Nelspruit as far as the Soutpansberg. A training college for Black teachers has been built at Tzaneen and an industrial town with the necessary infrastructure has been built at Letaba. 68 industrial sites are available there.</p>
<p>A beautiful modern hospital has been built at Letaba; a beautiful hospital has been built at Duiwelskloof; a hospital has been built at Elim and these hospitals serve the Black areas of the north.</p>
<p>In the agricultural field, a large sisal farm has been established at Letsetele. This farm is situated on the banks of the Letsetele River and an irrigation canal has been constructed which runs the property. It also adjoins the Letsetele station and a defibre-ing factory is in operation there. In the meantime two capital cities are being constructed, one for the Shangaans at Giyani and one at Sibasa for the Vendas. Prof. Ntsanwisĭ who is often in the news, is the head of the Shangaan nation and Chief Minister Mphephu is head of the Vendas.</p>
<p>There are citrus plantations along the Letaba River and various farms will be transferred to the Blacks in the near future. Coffee is grown on the farm Tours in the Letaba area and another plantation will be established at Hazyview which is near Nelspruit.</p>
<p>I want to mention the name of one person, namely Dr. Van Marle. He is the chief agricultural adviser of the Economic Development Council and he is doing excellent work in this connection.</p>
<p>A very large irrigation dam is being built near Giyani that will hold approximately 60 000 morgen feet of water for irrigation purposes. Tea is grown at Sibasa with the support of Sapeko. They have their own factories which are already in operation. The idea is to produce tea and coffee at Elim on a larger scale as well as in the Trichardtsdal or Colaco area.</p>
<p>As far as mineral development is concerned, we all know there are rich coal deposits in Vendaland which are now going to be mined on behalf of and for the benefit of the Venda people.</p>
<p>One of the oldest goldmines in the country is to be found in Shangaan territory. Phosphate has also been discovered in Shangaan territory but problems are still being experienced in separating the minerals from the phosphate. Chrome is being mined at Steelpoort and this is of great benefit to the North Sotho&#x2019;s and there is an international hotel at Tzaneen which accommodates people of all the racial groups.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, you will forgive me if I refer briefly to Australia. I read in the Press recently that Australia too is contemplating legislation to establish separate areas for their indigenous peoples so that the Whites in Australia will no longer exploit them.</p>
<p>In conclusion I want to say a few words to the hon. the Deputy Minister. It is our policy to make the Black people who live in the cities aware of their homelands and to get them to retain their family ties. But there is one thing that worries everyone and this happens when these people travel over weekends from Pretoria and the Reef to their homelands in the north. I am only talking about the north because that is where I come from and I know the circumstances that exist there. One finds that the traffic policemen, with their notebooks at the ready, stop these vehicles as though those people have already committed an offence. That hurts one, Sir. A man may have a few chairs that he is taking to his homeland on the roof of his car, or some iron sheeting that protrudes about six inches beyond the permissible limit. Those people are penalized severely for those contraventions. We know it is illegal, we know they are contravening the law, but that is not something that endangers anyone on the road. If that were the position, I would condone the actions of the traffic policemen. If those people constitute a danger to traffic generally I agree that the vehicle should be taken off the road, but as far as these piffling little things are concerned, I shall be very grateful to the hon. the Deputy Minister if he would look into the matter. I notice some hon. Senators shaking their heads thereby indicating that such action is a contravention of the ordinances. We know that is so, but we must after all allow these people at least to visit their homelands.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I really am very sorry that the hon. Senator Joubert has found it necessary to say that what we need in this House is a responsible Opposition. Sir, if you want to see a responsible Opposition, it is this Opposition sitting here. If the hon. Senator wants to know what happened, in fact, when we did have an irresponsible Opposition in this country he should read the Hansards of 1940, 1941 and 1942. He will realize then that this is in fact a first-class Opposition. But I leave it at that, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>I listened with the greatest interest to the speech of the hon. Senator De Jager. I know the part of the world he comes from. My father had a farm there in the early &#x2019;thirties. The farm was situated on the banks of the Letaba River; the farm was called Masala and also Gemsbok. I used to hunt and fish there. It is a wonderful part of the world. I am pleased to learn of the development that is taking place there. However, the hon. Senator must not claim the credit for that development for the NP Government alone. The policy of homelands for the Black people of South Africa is a Louis Botha policy of 1913. [Interjections.] The hon. Senator Dippenaar has not been in politics very long and if he has been in politics for some time he has not taken the trouble of studying the political history of South Africa. The first land-ownership legislation in respect of the Black people&#x2014;the hon. Deputy Minister will know this&#x2014;was introduced in 1913 by Louis Botha. The principle was that there should be homelands for the Black people. Both Gen. Botha and Gen. Hertzog subscribed to that principle. Those are irrefutable facts, Sir. The hon. Senator Dippenaar will be well-advised to refer to the Act of 1913. He does not know about it and so I shall forgive him his ignorance.</p>
<p>Let me state clearly, Mr. Chairman, that we agree with the policy of homelands for the Black people. We agree with the policy that those homelands should be developed and that job opportunities should be created &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, of course; that has been our policy since 1913. [Interjections.] Please, we are dealing with a serious matter. We are not at Baardskeerdersbos at the moment. The one aspect of that policy with which we disagree is the concept of the sovereign independence of those homelands. That is where we find the parting of the ways.</p>
<p>†We do not agree with the policy of sovereign independence. We believe that many of these areas will not be viable as politically independent states and we believe there will be trouble&#x2014;serious international trouble. But I shall not elaborate on that.</p>
<p>*We agree with the policy of promoting the group identity of the homelands but not with the aspect of independence coupled with it. I repeat: We do not agree with the idea of independence. I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that whether the policy of his Government of sovereign independence is or is not applied in all the homelands, there will always be a residual problem, a remaining problem. That problem has to do with the Black man who is a permanent part of White South Africa. After one has done everything one possibly can, after one has established homelands and developed them to the stage of independence&#x2014;a concept with which we do not agree&#x2014;one will be left with a residual problem, or a residual situation, where there will be thousands and thousands of Black people who will constitute a per manent part of the urban population in South Africa.</p>

<p>*We have agreed that the hon. the Deputy Minister will be given an opportunity to reply to the debate and I do not want to exceed the time allotted to me. Neither will I speak again, Sir. I just want to say this to the hon. the Deputy Minister, because this is the crux of the matter. After one has done everything possible to settle the Black people in independent homelands, one will still have two or three million Black people who will form part of the urban population of South Africa, Black people who will regard themselves as part of that urban population. What solution to that problem does the policy of the NP offer? There has to be a social solution, there has to be a political solution, especially a political solution, and I should like to hear the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s views in this connection. We believe in group identity and we believe that those people should be represented. [Interjections.] No, not here because this is the White Parliament. One of these days I shall deliver a lecture on that subject. The question I want to put directly to the hon. the Deputy Minister is this: How does his Government regard the position of the residual Blacks who are permanently resident in the White urban areas in places like Langa, Guguletu, Soweto and so forth? If the Government does not have a policy in respect of those people then they have no policy. I should like to give the hon. the Deputy Minister the opportunity this afternoon of telling the House what they are going to do in the political field with those permanently settled Blacks?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLURAL RELATIONS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to express my appreciation for the opportunity to reply to the discussion of my Vote in this hon. House. I want to apologize for the hon. the Minister who could unfortunately not be here today. I do not apologize for myself because I was given such short notice to take over here. I shall do my best, and, as the hon. Senator Webber has given me credit for, I shall do my best to reply as straightforwardly as possible to the questions and requests which have been put.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, allow me to begin by just referring to the resignation of a very competent official, the Secretary of the present Department of Plural Relations and Development&#x2014;I understand that it will only be known as the Department of Co-operation and Development from 1 June&#x2014;Mr. Van Onselen, a very, very competent, dedicated, energetic and intelligent official who has served our country and this department in particular for more than 43 years. I think we all agree that I should pay a great and warm tribute to such a competent official.</p>
<p>Secondly, I should like to express a word of warm welcome to Mr. Raath, his successor, who is an equally competent official. He is very dedicated, he knows the work of his department through and through, he knows the Government&#x2019;s policy through and through and he is somebody who is dedicated to the great task not only of serving this specific department but also of serving South Africa.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, with these few introductory remarks, I should like to go further. One could talk for a long time about this department and its functions and the policy which is the basis of its functions. I am glad I do not have to talk until after 6 o&#x2019;clock. I shall try to finish before the time. It is a very interesting subject and one could say a lot about it, from both sides of the House. I found it interesting to see how hon. Senators opposite agree in many respects with the philosophy of this side of the House and appreciate some of the practical steps we have taken. They accept our reports and recommendations and there is a feeling of optimism even on the other side of the House in regard to the implementation of the policy of the Government.</p>
<p>It would perhaps be as well if I were to refer to certain broad points of departure in the implementation of the policy of the Government. To begin with, we have inherited a certain political and economic setup in South Africa. The political set-up can in my view be described as follows: Over the years, in fact the centuries, the White has occupied a certain privileged and ruling position in South Africa, and gradually he has had to answer to himself as to how to accommodate the political position and aspirations of the non-White nations within the broader South African context. That is the politics of South Africa. That is the politics with which this side of the House is wrestling, and with which that side of the House and anybody in South Africa has to wrestle. It is a fact, viz. a political and economic set-up. I also find it interesting that many people outside South Africa are wrestling with similar problems where there is plurality in the population setup. Here, for instance, is the opinion of a well known writer, James Furnival, in his book entitled <i>Plural Society.</i> He says the following about a plural society&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It consists always of the Western superstructure of political and cultural supremacy &#x2026;</block>
<p>This is a historical viewpoint&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; within the confines of which there is to be found a medley of peoples that mix but do not combine, since each group clings partly perforce to its language and culture, its religion and its habits of life. They live side by side but separately, but it is not an integrated society, for their sole field of interrelationship is the economic one. They meet only in the market, buying and selling goods, services, labour and skill and there is commonly a division of labour by racial groups.</block>
<p>This was said by an observer of a plural setup in a country who says that under the same system of government, within the same national borders, there can be a plurality of societies which meet in the market place, which make contact in labour situations, but which do not combine, which in fact do not integrate, and which therefore do not form a unitary society. There are other authorities one could quote, but I do not want to tire hon. Senators with quotations. There are South Africans, Americans and others in Africa who have observed this same phenomenon and who identify its problems, problems with which we in South Africa are, I shall not say embarrassed, but rather which give us an opportunity to show the strength of our intellectual resources to deal with this question and to establish an acceptable living pattern for the various nations on social and economic levels, and particularly with regard to political expression.</p>
<p>I want to go further and say that part of our set-up is, of course, the plurality of nations. Nobody denies that Hon. Senators opposite admit it. The question is how one resolves the multi-national existence politically and constitutionally. That is the question and we realize that. The NP has a particular answer to this, and in the course of my reply I shall try to elaborate on this somewhat. Having said that, and having spoken of the plurality of nations, the interlacing of certain interests, without obtaining an open or unitary society, the fact remains that there is a certain, a very high degree, of mutual interdependence among the various communities. These communities are identifiable but there is a very important and a high degree of inter-dependence and we are not bewailing this. We are not complaining about it but it calls for special statesmanlike wisdom in this set-up to maintain political peace and calm and to ensure self-determination for the various communities.</p>
<p>A further fact, and we do not apologize for it, is White power and White freedom and White supremacy. That is a fact People who expect the White in South Africa to lightheartedly forfeit his say, his grip on his political destiny, are asking too much of the White. No nation worth its salt, having political power in its hands, is going to share it so cheaply with others that in the sharing process it might forfeit its authority over himself. No nation would do that readily. The situation in South Africa does not necessarily ask that of us. The reply we must give to this, though, will need the wisdom of Solomon. But we do have a few young Solomons. I am not saying that this only applies to one side of the House, neither do I want to say that I am numbered among them, but I think we are blessed with people of vision and who in addition have love, love for that which is their own, and who have a sense of fairness and justice in so far as the rights and claims of all communities in South Africa are concerned.</p>

<p>Having said that, and I have stressed something for which none of us apologize, viz. White power and the claim to freedom, there is another fact we have to contend with, namely, Black national power and the Black nations striving for freedom. That is a fact. What we are not prepared to do, namely, to be dominated, we accept. And as a Nationalist I accept that that is the striving of every Black nation and of any other nation worth its salt which calls itself a nation or a society or an ethnic group. They do not want to be permanently dominated. That is fact. Together with this goes its claim to self-determination to the greatest extent possible. This implies too that for such a society to grow as a society with self-respect it is necessary&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Not to be subjected to patterns of self-hate and self-rejection, but to grow in self-esteem and self-determination.</block>
<p>For this it is necessary for it to have economic opportunities&#x2014;we have always been concerned with practical politics in South Africa&#x2014;the economic opportunities needed by any society so that members of that society an lead a decent existence as individuals and at the same time so that the individuals who are members of a particular society can contribute to the communal interest in such a way that that society can take on a sort of continuous action in playing its own part in making its contribution and existing independently alongside other societies. This has always been the problem with which we have had to contend in South Africa. To make this possible, and we realize this on both sides of the House, we operate within what I want to call&#x2014;I do not know too much about it&#x2014;a free market mechanism. These are things which always pose the same problems for the Nationalist, a former UP, the present NRP and the present PFP, namely, that while one participates with other societies in the same free marketing mechanism, at the same time there is security for one&#x2019;s society&#x2019;s social, educational, recreational, cultural and religious foundations; in fact, for the whole basic structure of such a society. Sir, no matter how important the economic aspect might be, when we are dealing with these matters, we are dealing with something more than just pure economics. Then the economic interest is placed within a framework of other interests or facets within which a society expresses itself and which is important to it in its functioning as a society. I went so far as to say to the Suid-Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, where people are engaged mainly in the economic sphere, that economics are definitely very important. It is no use trying to pretend they are not there; they are definitely important to a large extent and in many respects. If they do not dictate completely to politics, they dictate to policies to a very important extent so that politics cannot without further ado adopt a course regardless of the economic laws of the country.</p>

<p>I noticed that the hon. Senator was listening very carefully to me and I do not want to spoil a good relationship. But I think he will also agree with me that the problem or challenge facing South Africa is the nations&#x2019; entry to and their participation in that same marketing mechanism; their participation in a free enterprise, free initiative and a free capitalistic system; participation in the welfare of a country. This must all come about so that each one&#x2019;s communal life, its own educational institutions and recreational facilities&#x2014;the gears of a particular society&#x2014;as well as its political control are retained by a particular society. That is the problem in South Africa. That is the problem in Europe.</p>
<p>In Europe we find sovereign states. Actually, all sovereignty is limited. If it is not confined to the vertical relationship of the creature to the Almighty, it is confined horizontally because no individual&#x2019;s exercise of freedom or sovereignty can be unconfined and simply overwhelm the sovereignty of others. Now all I say is that as far as sovereign countries are concerned, they must realize that on economic and other levels they do not have an absolute, water-tight independence and, by virtue of their interdependence, they will have to take certain measures. These measures apply in respect of co-operation and the maintenance of communal interests but reserving their own political control and the protection of all those institutions which are important to a specific nation, ethnic group or whatever, for the preservation of its identity and the implementation of its right to self-determination. With these words I have really only set out the problem areas, but that is what we have to wrestle with.</p>
<p>Because of our particular history, we on this side place great emphasis on this. It is the history of a people who wrestled with an imperialist power and shook off imperialism. We have arrived at a situation in which we are confronted by a challenge to make that freedom we have earned for ourselves possible for other nations within the same broad geographic space in South African life. Sir, that is a big challenge!</p>
<p>I want to refer to a few particulars regarding the development of the Black states. This is the basic concept in the implementation of our policy. The hon. Senator Horak Said he had no objection to the idea of the development of Black states but that they must not be sovereign independent states. Sir, I would not go so far as to say that he is very close to the political kingdom. I do not want to use idle words. That is the striving of the National Party. Let me put it this way. Supposing, in the language of the hon. Senator as a member of the Opposition, we were to say we were opposed to sovereign independence for a Black nation, would we not by so doing create a sort of frustration and obstruct inspirations by saying: You cannot achieve sovereign independence. We do not want you to get it because we do not think you will be economically viable or militarily defensible?</p>
<p>I do not think there is any difference in respect of the problems confronting any Black state in the Southern Africa context when it accepts independence. We are aware of the serious problems facing such states. But, Sir, if we say to such a state categorically, on the basis of political principle: I am opposed to sovereign independence for your state, we would be doing such a state an injustice. We will be depriving it of the privilege of making its own mistakes. Furthermore we will be depriving it of the privilege of proving that it can exist in sovereign independence.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Its mistakes can harm us as Whites.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, that could be harmful. I think though that the hon. Senator will realize that if you say to a nation&#x2014;and this applies to any individual or to any community&#x2014;while you are in control: You cannot become independent; you must operate within the same set-up as I do&#x2014;with the accompanying political dangers for the Whites&#x2014;you deprive it of a freedom which virtually all nations in the world claim.</p>
<p>Sir, I would say the advantage in the policy of the NP is this: We say they can have sovereign independence; we shall set up the necessary machinery; we shall conduct the necessary negotiations and enter into the requisite agreements with the states. But if a state does not want to be independent, we shall not drive it in that direction. That we have said. But such a nation will then have to realize that if it does not accept independence it will be accepting an inferior position within the broader context. In that inferior position, however, we shall also give it every opportunity to take over all the functions attaching to its own national economy. Our experience has been that they accept all the functions which are transferred to them.</p>
<p>Sir, I do not want to speak longer than is necessary. One could say a lot more in this connection. Against this background the development of Black states is of particular importance for us. In the light of this it is necessary that we should examine every development possibility within such a Black state. Hon. Senators opposite have reminded us that the development of the Black areas is an old policy. I think one can go back to statements prior to 1913. Since then it has run through our history like a golden thread. If I might interrupt myself, I would just like to say that I can still remember how I spelt out this history in 1970 to one of the most hardened UP members in Waterberg. I told him that the development of the Black states&#x2014;reserves or their own areas for the Black people&#x2014;was not a new idea. At that time I leant fairly heavily on Gen. Hertzog, and also a little with my left hand on Gen. Smuts. I said to him: But the generals agreed on this matter. He just sat and looked at me and said: Come, come, I am waiting for you. But I think I am still waiting for him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is no difference on this. What we called the reserves at one time were, on the acceptance of that report&#x2014;I think it was the Sauer Commission&#x2014;in 1948-&#x2019;49 expressly described at the fatherlands of the Black nations. Sir, you have been in politics longer than I have but when I read up my history, I also know that. Not even all Nationalists realized the full implications of this in 1948 or even after that. Many of our people accepted the fact that as long as we kept the Black people separate and gave them a large measure of self-government they would be satisfied and, in the meantime, we would retain our say over them. But the inherent logic and the implied demands of the freedom struggle of nations, which is really built into the policy of the NP, forces us to carry out the implications for ourselves, for the country and for the Black people for the good of all, right up to the possibility which we envisage for the Black people, viz. to develop and exercise their own sovereign rights within their own territory.</p>
<p>In this connection we realize the necessity for the establishment of industries, the creation of job opportunities and the establishment of development corporations which we have set up with this aim in view. I think this is old news, Mr. Chairman, and I need not repeat everything. But I should like to point out as far as job opportunities and the development corporations responsible for these, are concerned that no less than R56 million has been appropriated for this purpose this year.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Webber put a question in connection with consolidation to which I shall reply shortly. In the meantime I may just say that R53 million has been appropriated for this purpose while another R20 million has been promised. We realize that it is important that cities and towns in those areas should be developed with a concomitant infrastructure which will have the cumulative effective of creating more job opportunities. One basic job opportunity creates further job opportunities for many more people and this means an opportunity in life for so many more individuals who are dependent upon it in the family context.</p>
<p>As far as this department alone is concerned, R2&#x00BD; million has been appropriated for schools, R9 million for clinics, and R12&#x00BD; million for physical infrastructure. I do not want to bore hon. Senators with figures, however, because these figures can be obtained from the department at any time.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should proceed to the questions put by hon. Senators. In the first place I want to thank hon. Senators on this side of the House for their contributions. In fact, I should thank all hon. Senators for their contributions and I am grateful for the opportunity of replying to some of their questions.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Odendaal devoted his speech mainly to educational opportunities for Black nations and to the necessity for the provision of school facilities and the establishment of their own institutions. He also referred to the value of ethnicity which is acknowledged all over the world. Sir, if one wants to be pleasantly surprised, one must read some of the modern sociologists&#x2019; works, even those of American sociologists. They stress the value, I could almost say the pressing value, of ethnicity within the greater American set-up, and ask for renewed attention for the political implications of the existence of ethnicity. These are the people who simply have to admit that the whole idea of Americanization of each and everybody just does not work; it has been rejected. They admit that race consciousness has raised its head in a city like New York, not to mention Washington and other places.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senator Havenga referred to the functions of community councils and gave a very interesting dissertation in this regard. Perhaps I should just sound a word of warning here. I think that in the past hon. Senators have been inclined to include all educational matters and control over education indiscriminately among the functions of community councils. In my view one should draw a distinction here. There is a certain skilled facet of education which one cannot summarily transfer to a community council. Certain aspects, e.g. the provision of sites and so on, can be referred to a community council, but one would not, for instance, saddle the City Council of Pretoria with responsibility for educational matters in that city. That municipality has a definite function in respect of local matters but it does not go so far as to include the control of a professional question falling outside its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator also inquired as to the future of Whites on administration boards. Unfortunately, I cannot remember his second question, but perhaps he could remind me and I can give him a reply later. The assurance has been repeatedly given to the White officials by two previous Ministers, <i>inter alia</i>, Mr. M. C. Botha and Dr. Mulder, and also by Dr. Vosloo, that there is a sound future for them and that the Government will definitely look after their interests. The same applies to academics attached to State universities. They have asked what security there is for them, and the Government on its part is doing everything it can to give security to those people and to guarantee it. But the fact remains that the services of these people on the administration boards is so much in demand that for years there will be no question of their becoming superfluous or that their services will no longer be required.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator De Jager is an authority in the industrial world and asked for the stricter implementation of influx control. I understand he had to leave, but I want to thank him for his contribution. I have noted what he said with appreciation.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Schoor has an oral and written eloquence all his own. He made us all feel once again that it was worthwhile being a Nationalist and that it was worthwhile implementing the policies of the Government. It is not an embarrassment, Sir, but an opportunity, in spite of all the problems attaching to it. He also spoke of the political evolution taking place in South Africa. He also referred with great praise to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Development and I hope the Deputy Minister will read his speech in Hansard. I have noted with appreciation what the hon. Senator said.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Joubert made a very informative speech. I think to a certain extent he replied to certain questions put by the hon. Senator Oelrich in regard to the purchase of land at Thaba Nchu.</p>

<p>The hon. Senator says the answers were not satisfactory. Well, I do not want to appear over-modest but I am afraid that I too will perhaps not be able to give satisfactory replies to these questions. However, while we are discussing the exchange of land it might be interesting to point out that a request was sent to President Mangope by the Government prior to independence regarding the exchange of land, but he was not in favour of it. I do not want to say now that one gets the impression when he speaks of consolidation that he wants all the land between Mafeking and Thaba Nchu!</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on a point of explanation, the question I actually put to the hon. the Deputy Minister was whether in view of the prevailing circumstances and the confusion that has arisen because of the speech made in the Other Place, he agreed that expropriation and the method of payment in these particular circumstances was correct.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Sir, I have that question noted against the name of the hon. Senator Oelrich. But I should like to defer it for a while, and I hope I shall have the time to reply to it.</p>
<p>I shall not have sufficient time to appreciatively second all the hon. Senator Joubert had to say because he referred to diverse aspects. He said, <i>inter alia</i>, that it is the easiest policy to sell. I think there is a lot of truth in that and I agree with him because it is a policy of indigenous development, a policy of separate development. Incidentally, Sir, hon. Senators on the other side are now talking about appellations. They say that we have moved away from apartheid and now talk of separate development. The old Chinese proverb says: &#x201C;A beloved child has many names.&#x201D; That applies here too. The beloved child has many names. But perhaps that is also true of the Opposition. A beloved child like the Opposition party also has many names. Its old name was United Party and that has been changed, and look what has happened to them now. They should rather have kept the old name. Now they are battling with an NRP and who knows how many other parties.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>The name makes no difference, it still remains the policy!</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, and the beloved child is still separate development; it will continue on a basis of apartheid as far as political control, social institutions and such like are concerned. We do not regret that. A policy like this is the essence of sound planning for a country like South Africa. [Interjections.] The hon. Senator Joubert will forgive me if I do not deal with the further points he raised.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator De Jager spoke of development in the Black states and gave some very interesting particulars. He also referred to adversity suffered by people coming back to the Black states from the urban areas. I think this is something to which attention will have to be given.</p>
<p>It seems to me I have really very little time left for the real Opposition, but I shall do my best. I want to start with the hon. Senator Du Toit. He is very fond of the policy of his former party. I give credit to anyone who has a love for what is his own, even if it has become outmoded and all that remains is a lovely memory. Many of us live on lovely memories, and perhaps they mean a lot to us. Perhaps it is not so topical at present, and may be even less so for the future. But I want to remind the hon. Senator that the reserves he speaks of&#x2014;as the NP said in 1948&#x2014;must be developed as the fatherlands of the Black nations. That is what we are doing. The hon. Senator is of the opinion that we are not giving enough attention to agricultural training. I want to agree with him in this respect that it is very, very important facet in the development of the Black nations and their territories. But we have various problems to contend with. We have certain traditional social institutions to contend with. We have to take account of communal land ownership and a sort of subsistence economy. This is a process which goes hand in hand with other assumed processes which will come about. It is a total community which must really develop on all levels and that development must take place in a responsible manner so that we do not distort the nature of those people, their traditions and their way of life, with the result that they do not know what they are. Part of that set-up is their manner of handling and utilizing the land. I can tell the hon. Senator that we place emphasis on agricultural training; it is very important. For the past ten years at Fort Hare we have offered a B.Sc. degree in agriculture, a baccalaureus degree, which is designed to instruct people at a practical level so that they can be of service to their own community.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator spoke of the total cost of resettlement. It is difficult to reply to this because resettlement might cost as much if not more than the purchase of the land itself. I might just say that for the current year more than R12 million has been appropriated for resettlement. It is difficult to lay down a definite time and to say when it will be finalized. But the total cost will be considerable and the exact amount I do not have available at the moment.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator also asked if further land would be allocated to Bophuthatswana, for instance, and one might also add Transkei to this. Mr. Chairman, the announcement made by the Prime Minister in regard to the negotiations which would take place and the investigation which would be made, included Transkei and Bophuthatswana, and Venda will also be included. This does not necessarily imply that these countries will get more land, but when investigating the meaningful living space for a specific nation one must not only examine the concatenation aspect of the land but also the adequacy of that land. I do not think the Government should compromise itself in advance by saying that there will be more land.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I might leave the matter at that for the moment, and I hope the hon. Senator is satisfied.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Webber, like a good minister&#x2014;I think his brother is a minister&#x2014;had three points. [Interjections.] There is an old proverb which says: When it rains on the minister, some drops fall on the verger. I do not know if some drops fell on the hon. Senator, but he let three considerable drops fall here! First of all, he spoke of influx control. Sir, I think we all agree that this is a very acute and a very real question. Let us admit to one another that it is not necessary for one party to claim for itself in effect all humanitarian feelings. On both sides of the House we realize that we are dealing with people. We are dealing with people who want to eat, people who want clothes, people who want somewhere to live, and for this they must have work. We all appreciate this. We all appreciate the problems which go beyond these primary requirements of the human being, that is, the requirements of living in a community; I could almost say the requirement of not having one&#x2019;s existence threatened. Where one&#x2019;s personal life is concerned, to the extent that one does not want it threatened, this also applies to community life. We are not only dealing with human relationships, human rights, and so on. We are also dealing with the rights of nations, the rights of communities and also with the relations between nations. Over and above the purely economic laws of supply and demand for labour and the payment therefor, one comes to the provisions of the law to which a community is also subject and which causes that community to say: &#x201C;I claim protection.&#x201D; That brings us to another part of the crux of the matter.</p>
<p>Some years ago a few of us had the privilege of doing a tour of Britain at the invitation of Her Majesty. Before we left, we were received by the British Ambassador here in South Africa. He said the following to us: &#x201C;If you are asked about influx control, then just ask them if they want another Calcutta in South Africa; do they want a Calcutta situation in South Africa?&#x201D; Sir, when we have taken every humane consideration into account&#x2014;and I think we do that&#x2014;the fact still remains that when there is an influx of people to a restricted number of jobs, to a restricted amount of housing, and so on, then one must have control. Control must be exercised somewhere over this situation.</p>
<p>I go so far as to say that I think that one should look more at the factors than merely at the question of whether there is a house and whether there is work. Those of course are the most important requirements. I want to point out to the hon. Senator that this does not apply to circumstances in urban townships. Another question arises and that is what the position in the rural areas and on the farms will be. Sir, you know yourself, and the hon. Senator Horak will know, having lived through so much history here, that in 1936 Gen. Hertzog used a word we would not use today. I do not want to pose as an expert in the literary field by saying that the word is functionally correct in the story. But Gen. Hertzog warned against what he called &#x201C;kafferboerdery&#x201D;. If my interpretation is correct, this means that some farmers had collected so many Black people on their farms that one could almost call it farming with Black people today. The Black people lived on the farms, they assured the farmer of a certain income for the right to live there. It was, in fact, farming with Black people. It might well be argued that there is plenty of room on a farm and that the farmer could give that Black man some small job, but the Black man had to pay for living there. It is for that reason that we have control measures regarding the number of Black people who might live on a farm.</p>

<p>If we have such unanimity, Sir, we shall have to see if there is not another seat on this side of the House!</p>
<p>I want to refer to another point. [Interjections.] No, before you come we will put up a fence!</p>
<p>There is another factor, Sir, and that is the element of unemployed persons within a particular residential area. That we also have to take into account.</p>
<p>I think I have already said something about consolidation. If hon. Senators think it is necessary, I can repeat what the hon. the Prime Minister said in this regard. But I do not think it is necessary because it is available for them to read.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator spoke of total consolidation. In this connection I just want to remark that of course this would be the ideal situation for purposes of administration, for purposes of defence and for many other practical considerations. At the moment there are also other very important considerations for these people and those are the proximity or accessibility of job opportunities. The position obtains at the moment that, even though we may not care for the fragmented picture of, say, Bophuthatswana, under the present situation it has its advantages because those people within such an area&#x2014;we could call it a spot&#x2014;are within striking distance of the White area where there are job opportunities. Circumstances may change, but with this in mind our former Prime Minister, my predecessor in this department and the present Minister too, envisaged the possibility of the exchange of land. I want to say at once that we all admit that we must not take it too far. For instance, we shall not hold out the possibility of an exchange of land for all time in the future, as if nothing were definite. I do not think we should do that because then we would be creating a feeling of uncertainty among our own people and among the Black people. But I am keeping that door open as a possibility.</p>

<p>What about the 1975 decision?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>We announced that the 1975 decision would be implemented. We are continuously in the process of implementing it. In the meantime we shall make inquiries, as the hon. the Prime Minister has said, in terms of the desire for freedom of these nations, to see whether the land for these nations really complies with that broad striving for freedom which we want for these people. We are prepared to look at it again. I think I must tell the Opposition now that when we say we will not adhere rigidly to the 1936 quota, it does not mean, in my view, that we are going to put the whole of South Africa on a table like a cake and start cutting it up at random. I do not think that can happen. I do not think that will happen. In any case, it would not be meaningful, to use a word which hon. Senators think originated on the other side. I thought I was the one who first used it. It is like the person who thought he had hit on a very original philosophical idea. He lay awake all night and then the following day he read Plato or Aristotle and found that it really was not so new. It had been thought of then. But that was a long time before that hon. Opposition came into existence.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator referred to R15 million. That R15 million is not just there for the taking. It is R15 million which will be used in the process of offering to purchase farms and the acceptance of the offer to purchase, which cannot all be done at the stroke of a pen on one and the same day. It is an on-going process which entails the amount being transferred in the whole process of purchase, offer, refusal and re-application or re-offering, and which is not disbursed at any particular moment in that process. However, it is not R30 million but R15 million which is carried over from year to year in this way.</p>

<p>The question of the land which is not transferred really falls within the jurisdiction of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Development. To the best of my knowledge I can say though that there is very little land still to be purchased for kwaZulu. Another matter which is relevant, however, is exchange land and land which has to be excised. There is the question of the resettlement of people in certain areas. These things take time. I have personal experience of this because we are faced with the same problem in Waterberg. There is, for instance, a part where people want to build a road which will run through a section of Black land. We now have to arrange with those people to purchase that land. But in the meantime we have to resettle these people in a meaningful, fair, just and socially acceptable place. This takes time.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>It is a very important matter and I think we shall be able to give the hon. Senator a complete reply in that respect. It is necessary for him to have that.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers raised various matters. I do not disagree with her on the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;; I am not so allergic to it. But it is a beloved child with many names. However, I do think account should be taken of the fact that we were not dealing with a calm, fair, impartial, well-balanced, unprejudiced opposition within and without South Africa. Internally we had an Opposition who did not want to give this Government a snowball&#x2019;s hope of governing. Let us leave it at that; it is the privilege of any Opposition and its right to try to regain power, no matter how far out of reach it might be. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, certain things are not impossible on paper but whether or not they are in practice is another matter. I do not want to say much about the continued agitation overseas. But one must take this into account. However, I should like to reply specifically to the hon. Senator&#x2019;s question in regard to the documents. It was agreed with the Black states that they would be given authority to issue documents of their own choice. The only requirement we have laid down in this connection is that the document must identify the person and that he must be able to give a reason why he is at the place where he is found. This is a person who is travelling outside his Black state. A Black who has such a document in his possession need fear no problems. The Black states have still not issued these documents, but I want to assure the hon. Senator that negotiations in this regard are taking place. I think we can assure one another that there is no intention of handicapping people but in view of our situation it is also necessary to maintain order in South Africa, and we do not want a repetition of Crossroads. In my view, there is not a single hon. Senator who would like such a situation to occur again and that the place should be left just as it is, which is what certain foreign people would like.</p>
<p>I have here a reply in connection with the planning for Soweto. Various institutions were concerned with this planning, <i>inter alia </i>, the administration board, the Soweto Council, the Dobsonville Council and the Deepmeadow Council, and the report has been accepted in principle, but I think the State guarantee for this still has to be announced by the Minister of Finance, and he is as silent as the grave. However, I cannot blame him for maintaining this grave-like silence at times.</p>
<p>I think I have put my side of the main point raised by the hon. Senator Horak, viz. the question of sovereign states. He also referred to the problem of Black people outside the Black states, and I must admit at once that it is not an insignificant problem. But in all the economic processes those people have not become part of a particular Black, White or any other nation. Our experience is that in many important respects they retain feeling for or contact with their own nations. Our approach is a policy of nations, so we want to give the various nations the greatest possible degree of responsibility, coupled with their own Black states, their own economy, and so on. But&#x2014;and I think I can say this quite definitely&#x2014;we do not envisage the inclusion of Black nations and their political expression in the political system together with the White man. I think I shall leave it at that. I know the hon. Senator would like to say more about it, but I shall leave it at that.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Section 8 of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, 1964, provides that the State President shall appoint a delimitation commission at intervals of not less than five and not more than 10 years commencing on the last preceding division of constituencies. Since the last delimitation took place on 23 May 1969, such a commission, in terms of section 8, would have to be appointed before 23 May 1979. However, there are two reasons why a delimitation of constituencies is neither possible nor desirable at this stage. In the first place, a general registration of voters which included 18-year-olds for the first time took place up to 1 May 1979, after which a substantial period is required for the processing and preparation of the data before it can be submitted to a delimitation commission in a meaningful form.</p>
<p>Secondly, a delimitation in terms of existing legal requirements would provide for a mere 40 constituencies, whereas the Government has already undertaken on the termination of the term of office of the existing council, to constitute a fully elected council which will require 60 constituencies based on the existing number of members. Moreover, in the new constitutional proposals of the Government, 82 constituencies are proposed for the Coloured Parliament (or House of Representatives).</p>
<p>At this stage, therefore, it is not appropriate to arrange a redelimitation since there is no certainty as to whether the number of constituencies to be delimitated should be 40, 60 or the proposed 82 in terms of the Government&#x2019;s proposals and other proposals that the Select Committee of both Houses of Parliament must consider.</p>
<p>In view of the considerations mentioned, the executive of the CRC has also adopted a resolution in which it is requested that a delimitation should not take place now. By extending the maximum period in which a delimitation commission shall be appointed, the appointment of the commission may be postponed until the necessary data has been processed and the uncertainty relating to the further development in the constitutional sphere cleared up. After that, delimitation may proceed without delay. To provide therefore for what is envisaged, the period is being extended to 15 years in the Bill.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, it is my pleasant task today to thank the hon. the Minister. I think the hon. the Minister deserves it, because I know that his task has not been an easy one. In the first place he had to appoint the Wiehahn Commission and now he has to get his colleagues to the stage of accepting the important recommendations of the commission in principle. He has really shown that he has the courage of his convictions. Problems are still ahead for him, and I wish him every success in finding a solution to them. This new set-up is going to mean a lot to all population groups in this country. It will also mean a lot to us overseas. During the lunch-hour I was talking to an American who said that he was in New York when the report was published and that the recommendations of the commission made the headlines of many papers. I am convinced therefore that these matters will soon find their echo all over the world.</p>
<p>†Initially the White Paper deals with the maximum degree of selfgovernment in industry. Since the Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924 came into being we know that employers and trade unions enjoyed a large measure of selfgovernment and that the conditions in the industry improved considerably. We had far fewer strikes and in recent years we were fortunate to have had hardly any strikes, especially when one compares South Africa with overseas countries.</p>
<p>The White Paper also deals with the tripartite advisory board, which will be called the National Manpower Commission. I will deal with this aspect a little later.</p>
<p>I must say that I am not very happy with the change in the name of the department. We have become very accustomed to the name &#x201C;Department of Labour&#x201D; and it has become quite dear to us. I do not know whether all changes are good changes, but this is certainly not something I wish to quarrel about with the hon. the Minister. The new name will be the &#x201C;Department of Manpower and Development&#x201D;. I only hope this will reach the people in the same way as the Department of Labour did and that good organization will be the result of this new Department of Manpower, particularly as far as development is concerned.</p>
<p>Regarding the appointment of the National Manpower Commission, I think this is something that is long overdue. I can recall Dr. Rautenbach addressing a meeting of the TUC of South Africa in 1968. We were opposed to section 3 of the Environment Planning Act as it was a constant worry to us and gave us a great deal of trouble. In those days we suggested there should rather be a national manpower committee or committee consisting of representatives of employers, the Government and the trade unions to determine what labour was required for each particular industry. I am sure the manpower commission will fill a great need in our labour pattern and will assist with the further development of South Africa. When they have heard from all parties what the requirements are, they will make their recommendations to the hon. the Minister and I am sure this will augur well for the future.</p>
<p>I am pleased to see that the hon. the Minister intends to appoint the commission with the least possible delay. I can find no fault with the provision giving the hon. the Minister the discretion to decide on the term of office. I think it is right that the hon. the Minister should decide how long these people should serve. He may want to change his mind at a later stage because originally he may not be able to find the people necessary to serve on this commission to the best of their ability and he may over a period have to select other people whom he would like to have on the commission.</p>
<p>The next point I want to speak on is labour peace. Labour peace will be promoted by uniformity of labour policy and, in the interests of such uniformity, labour matters should preferably be dealt with by the Department of Labour. Here I also feel that not only the Department of Manpower and Development but the manpower commission too will be able to play an important part in this matter. There should be uniformity.</p>
<p>I have been in the trade union movement for many years and one has always found that when other people come into the field, clashes result. It is not in the interests of industry to have these clashes and I shall develop this argument further when we deal with the works committees. The position is that there should be uniformity in labour policy and preferably a national labour policy. It is in the best interests of the workers to have a national agreement which covers all the people in a given industry. The principle advanced here that unions should be organized on an industry basis is something we agree with wholeheartedly. This is something we have become accustomed to and I think it is only right that we retain what is known to us and which works best, viz. to organize workers on an industry basis. If there is any difficulty with demarcation we can always approach the Minister or an industrial court to try to decide how people should be demarcated. But it should definitely be on an industry basis.</p>
<p>I come now to industrial relations in South Africa and the question of the works committees and the liaison committees, or works councils as the commission has recommended these bodies should be called. I am really worried about this. Sir, I expressed the opinion in the past that I doubted whether the works committees and councils would really serve the purpose for which they had originally been established, because the agreements could never be published and put into force unless the workers took civil action. The workers who were covered by the works and liaison committees certainly did not have the money to protect either themselves or their colleagues by instituting a civil action so as to enforce an agreement.</p>
<p>I am worried about this kind of dual system that has been recommended. I found that the works councils worked best in Germany, but there they are not in competition with the trade unions; they work with the trade unions; they are subsidiaries of the trade union, as it were. They are doing a tremendous job in the factories but as far as negotiating agreements is concerned, that is the concern of the trade unions.</p>
<p>I should like to point out to the hon. the Minister that in the main these are ordinary workers; many of them are not highly educated and they are certainly not equipped to argue and to negotiate with sophisticated employers who, in most cases today, have had a university education and have attended business school at university. Those employers are well equipped to argue and to negotiate but as far as the workers are concerned, they are not. [Time expired].</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise merely to give the hon. Senator an opportunity to complete her speech.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#scheepers">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Thank you, Sir. I am grateful to the hon. Senator because it is of great assistance if one can continue and complete one&#x2019;s theme.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as that is concerned, I am afraid that there will be clashes if the two systems are to operate as envisaged in the White Paper, because if works committees or works councils negotiate agreements less favourable than those the trade unions have negotiated, there will definitely be trouble because next time the employers will want to enforce the conditions laid down by the works councils. I hope that the hon. the Minister will have a re-think about this matter and perhaps discuss it further with the trade union leaders. I am quite prepared to see committees of all racial groups operating in factories and dealing with matters affecting the factories&#x2014;at the moment we have something similar in the form of the shop steward committees&#x2014;but without the right of negotiation and without competing with the trade unions because the workers will be the people to suffer.</p>
<p>The next item is freedom of association. The recommendation by the commission is that individuals should be free to join any trade union of their choice. I agree with that, Sir. This is almost what one can call a revolution in our industrial legislation today. This was necessary long ago. But now that we have it, Sir, we want it to run smoothly. I feel that no section of workers should be compelled either to join a registered trade union or not to join. Today we have White trade unions, Coloured trade unions and mixed trade unions consisting of Whites, Coloureds and Indians. However, I feel that as far as the Black workers are concerned, if the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union decide that they want nothing to do with the Black workers, that is their choice. The only thing is that they must not be allowed to interfere with the organization of Black workers and with the negotiations between Black workers and their employers. Each union will go its own way. I feel that the workers must decide whether or not they want to have a mixed trade union. It must be explained to them properly, a ballot must be taken and if the majority decide&#x2014;I would even say it should be 60% of the workforce&#x2014;that they want a completely mixed union, it should be their right to have a completely mixed trade union. As I have said, if they do not decide this, then the Black workers must organize and, where there are industrial councils, they must also have representation on the industrial councils. The position is that I really believe in the free choice of workers and that there should be no compulsion whatsoever. However, I feel too that there just not be any loopholes because as far as the Black workers are concerned it will, in my opinion, be in their interests and in the interests of his country if they can work together with the present registered trade unions. Where this has happened although their unions were not registered&#x2014;for instance in the clothing, the tobacco and leather industries and in a number of other industries where they work jointly with the registered trade unions and where they have been taught by these unions and where leadership has been developed&#x2014;those unions are acting very responsibly. We want to see this being a success. Therefore, as far as leadership training is concerned and as far as guidance is concerned, it will be in the interests of all, should the workers so desire, that they should work together and not separately. Where they decide from the beginning that they want to be separate then that is, as far as I am concerned, for them to decide, although it would be advisable for them to form a federation and work together through a federation. I recall when I was in the United States in 1969, I was told that when the Black Americans came into the building industry, the Whites did not want them.</p>
<p>It is not only in South Africa that one has racialism; other countries also have it. They did not want these workers. These workers then said: &#x201C;All right we will go on our own.&#x201D; The position there has changed now as it has here. Today there are far more Black building workers than there are Whites. They have huge buildings and they have proper organizations with a large membership. And now, because the number of Whites is small, they want to join these people but they will not have them. Therefore the workers should be free to decide but in my view, if they do not have a mixed trade union then the best thing will be for them at least to have liaison through a federation to discuss their common problems.</p>
<p>As far as the permanently employed Blacks are concerned, they can become members automatically. They are eligible for membership of the trade unions and that is only right However, we now come to the next point about which we are worried. The hon. the Minister may be able to give us more information in this regard. As I and some of my hon. colleagues read it, we are not sure whether the foreign commuters or the migrants from our own independent homelands on the borders of South Africa are going to be excluded. I am not going to plead today that we must allow people from Mozambique or from other foreign countries which have never been part of South Africa to be recognized immediately. Let us overcome our initial problems and we can then discuss this matter at a later stage. However, as far as foreign commuters are concerned I would say that at least one-third of Pretoria&#x2019;s Black workers, if not more, commute from the homelands to Pretoria. This is also the case in Brits and in Rustenburg as well as in Newcastle, and particularly in Durban. KwaZulu borders on Durban. An employer told me today that if he were to take a census today in his factory in Durban he would find that almost every one of his workers would be a commuter from kwaZulu. I feel we cannot exclude these people. We must make provision for them. As far as the other workers are concerned, the Wage Board could cover them in the meantime or the industrial councils should have the power as they have today to extend their agreements to non-parties. Otherwise there will be problems between organized and unorganized workers which we definitely want to avoid at all costs. The White Paper states that &#x201C;the possibility is not excluded to consult self-governing states and the Government will retain autonomy&#x2019;&#x2019;. I remember that Professor Van der Merwe, who was also a member of the commission, was very keen at one stage that these people should stay in the homelands and that they should have their unions there and that their governments should negotiate. Mr. Chairman, to that we will be completely opposed. We are an autonomous country; we negotiate with our Government and we negotiate with our employers in so far as all the workers who are employed here are concerned. We want to retain that right. We must either extend the agreement or else our Wage Board must determine wages for those employees. No outside interference by other governments in this country&#x2019;s affairs as far as this matter is concerned will be tolerated. We have a large number of Greek workers here. We also have Portuguese and Dutch workers here; we have people of almost every nationality working here. We would not expect them to fall outside the ambit of the industrial councils or of the trade unions and expect their governments to negotiate with this Government. That would cause real chaos. Therefore I feel this is a matter for the Government, the trade unions and the employers. We should negotiate on behalf of these people and we should determine their wages. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#berg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not elaborate too much on the matters raised by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. She dealt in the main with the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission and explained what she expected of future legislation. We shall come to those matters when we deal with the legislation one of these days. I think we should preferably leave it at that for the moment and confine ourselves to other matters affecting the Labour Vote.</p>
<p>I should like to comment on two matters the hon. Senator raised. Firstly, she referred to the new name of the department Personally, I should also be pleased if the hon. the Minister would reconsider the name. &#x201C;Manpower Development&#x201D; is a fine name. But I myself feel very heartsore because &#x201C;Labour&#x201D; is disappearing. It may be a long name but I do not think we would be creating problems if we called it, for instance, &#x201C;Labour and Manpower Development&#x201D;. We then retain the Labour section and add Manpower Development, because in future the department is going to pay more attention to training. The &#x201C;development&#x201D; is therefore apt.</p>
<p>As far as the Manpower Commission is concerned, I also agree with the hon. Senator. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the appointment of this commission. I also want to congratulate him on the industrial court. I think these will bring about great improvements in the implementation of our legislation.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of freedom of association, it seems we have a choice between total freedom of association and the closed shop principle. If the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers is prepared to dispense with the closed shop principle in our agreements, we could possibly consider freedom of associa</p>
<p>tion. But I do not think the trade unions will agree with her because they are very set on the closed shop principle. But we shall be debating this matter and will go into it very carefully when the legislation is discussed. At the moment we are not quite sure precisely what the legislation entails because it only became available today and up to now we have not had an opportunity of studying it properly. I think therefore we should leave this until later.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say something about a few other matters and one of those is the question of unemployment. The whole world at the moment is having to cope with the problem of unemployment. The hon. the Minister and the Government are trying to cope with the problem as efficiently as possible. But it is a problem. Unfortunately, our economic growth rate has declined, although it is showing a slight upward trend again. Experts are of the opinion that we will probably have a growth rate of 4% this year, which will be a considerable improvement if it can be realized. But it is still not sufficient to create job opportunities for the masses who enter the labour market every year. Further attention will have to be given to this matter, and we shall have to look at it from all angles.</p>
<p>Let us look at the factors which play a part here and see how the problems can be solved. Continued economic growth is essential but there are also other factors, for instance, the question of our mines. Foreign labour consisting of about 200 000 men is used on the mines. At some stage we are going to have to ask the Government to give very serious consideration to that situation. It means that 200 000 of our Black citizens of this country, in the Republic, are being deprived of job opportunities because of the fact that we import 200 000 Black labourers on contract. That is one point.</p>
<p>Another is the question of mechanization and automation. Mr. Chairman, some years ago we commenced mechanization and automation in South Africa which was encouraged on all sides. Warnings came from various quarters that the lower paid workers would be the victims of mechanization and automation but these factors are synonomous with progress. We were then experiencing a boom period, the growth rate was increasing&#x2014;in respect of some industries it was even as high as 10%&#x2014;and so we did not feel this problem. But now it is beginning to look as if too many at the lower levels of our labour corps are being forced out of work as a result of this. In fact, many have undoubtedly been forced out of their work and perhaps we should apply the brakes in that respect. I am not opposed to progress and I am no enemy of automation and mechanization, but we cannot allow our progress to be thwarted. If unemployment assumes serious proportions it can cause all sorts of frustrations and create major problems.</p>
<p>The other problem I want to refer to is the question of the rate for the job. This factor has two legs. In the first place there is the case where one is dealing with the same type of work. There we are all agreed because one cannot differentiate among the races in this respect. If they do the same and equal work they must be paid the same rate. That is generally accepted and that is not such a dangerous thing. But the dangerous aspect is where we price ourselves out of the export market. That is where we are artificially closing the wage gap at the lowest rung. Each time the wage gap is narrowed in any industry, we can go and inquire and we will find that employers are using fewer men than they used earlier. In other words, we only put more people out of work by this closing of the wage gap and in the process we price ourselves out of the export market. Later we shall not be able to compete with America and other countries. These are the countries which are always urging us to close this wage gap because they know that if we price ourselves out we shall not be able to compete with them in the Africa market.</p>
<p>But my concern in the first place is that each time the wage gap is narrowed, just as in the other case, we lose job opportunities for the lowest ranks of our people. I can well remember, Mr. Chairman, that at one time I had to negotiate a wage agreement in a match factory. The managing director said to me: &#x201C;Look, Mr. Van den Bergh, I can give you the increase, but do you know what it means? It means a few less matches in each box.&#x201D; The same thing applies here; each time the lower wages are raised unproductively or inadvisedly, it means a few less job opportunities for the people. [Time expired.]</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#scheepers">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want firstly to deal with a few matters raised by the hon. Senator Van den Bergh. He spoke about the question of the closed shop. I think if the hon. the Minister asked any trade union in South Africa which employs the closed shop principle today if they wanted to change it for something else, their reply would be a definite &#x201C;no&#x201D;. This is a point which weighs heavily with the trade unions and is something they have had since the first Industrial Conciliation Act was passed in 1924. I just want to point out that the closed shop and the deduction of subscriptions are not principles which employers accert too readily. If the majority of the workers are not organized and negotiations have not taken place, those facilities are not available. I feel that the right of the trade unions to negotiate on the closed shop principle and also in regard to the deduction of subscriptions must not be interfered with; it must be left as it is. I am sure that the hon. the Minister will find it an uphill struggle if he goes against the trade unions in this matter.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van den Bergh also said that workers on the lower levels were being forced out, <i>inter alia</i>, by automation. I can understand this because this also happened in the past. If no job reservation is laid down for industries by law they practice their own job reservation, and if the employers cannot take on Black workers and the quality of the workers they have cannot be improved&#x2014;for instance, if they cannot be retrained or something of that nature&#x2014;they resort to automation. This is not in the interests of South Africa because too many workers come on to the labour market each year. We must encourage employers to provide more manual labour.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator spoke of the rate for the job. I also believe in the rate for the job where equal skill and equal responsibility are involved. I do not think just anybody should be given a higher wage if he does not have the same skill and does not do the same work. It would be totally wrong and would harm our economy. But if a person of another colour does the same work, has the same skill and the same responsibility, this principle must apply, otherwise the result will be that the non-White worker who works for a lower wage will in due course force out the White worker. That is the last thing any of us wants to have happen. But if the rate for the job is paid, in accordance with skill and responsibility, this would not happen quite so easily. In the industries I know the employers will always give preference to Whites because they have so many more years of experience than the other workers.</p>
<p>We know that not all workers today are completely productive. It is not only the duty of the Government or the employers, it is also the duty of the trade unions to put their shoulders to the wheel to train workers and to see that they become as productive as possible. I always say to the workers: If you are not productive it is not possible for the trade union to negotiate better working conditions for you. But if you are productive, then it makes our task very easy. They then have to choose whether they are going to be unproductive and work for a low wage for the rest of their lives or whether they are going to be productive. We encourage them to be productive. There is a tremendous amount the trade unions can do in this regard.</p>
<p>†Now, Mr. Chairman, as far as the committee system is concerned and the regulations setting up regional committees, I foresee great dangers. From the point of view of the unions, they represent the workers. Let me take as an example the National Union of Distributive Workers and NUCAW, which is the Coloured section of the Distributive Workers Union. They are organized all over the country. Let us say that there is a committee system at Durban or Port Elizabeth. The works committee negotiates an agreement there and negotiates for lower wages. The result is that the union will not be able to negotiate higher wages in other areas because that negotiated wage at Durban or Port Elizabeth will be the norm the employers will accept in respect of wages.</p>
<p>As I have said before, I feel these organizations should not have negotiating powers at all. The National Union of Distributive Workers has never had an industrial council and they can never get an industrial council because it is too difficult to organize all the workers throughout South Africa on a representative basis. They work through the Wage Board and as soon as a Wage Board determination is 12 months old they apply for a further investigation. I do not think the Wage Board knows any other union as well as it knows the NUDW. They have two determinations, one for the cities and large towns and one for the rural areas and smaller towns. They have worked extremely well through these determinations, they have improved the conditions of the workers and they have a satisfied work force. However, if we are going to allow these committees to negotiate&#x2014;I believe Greatermans have 150 stores and O.K. Bazaars 130 stores&#x2014;an impossible situation will arive if everyone fixes different wages through these committees. Consequently I am completely opposed to negotiation by these committees. They serve other useful purposes; they attend to factory discipline and factory routine; they also attend to factory complaints as far as rest room and other facilities are concerned and so forth but I do not think the art of negotiating falls within their sphere of activity.</p>
<p>I come now to relationships with industrial councils. I have no objection to people like the shop stewards being kept regularly informed. As far as most industrial councils are concerned, the trade unions make it their business to explain to the workers, either through the shop stewards where it is a very large industry or at a general meetings of members, what the conditions are before the agreement is finally concluded. That was how it was done in the past. In the case of my trade union, the Garmentworkers&#x2019; Union of South Africa, it also consulted the Black workers and explained to them what had been achieved. I am completely opposed, of course, to works and liaison committees having bargaining powers where industrial councils do exist. If they have such bargaining powers it will cause serious difficulties among the factory workers.</p>
<p>I am pleased that the Government has agreed that it will not be necessary for existing trade unions to re-register and that a register of these organizations will be compiled. I think that will be in the interests of all concerned and it will entail far less administrative work for both the trade unions and the Department of Labour.</p>
<p>It says here that there must be parity and in this regard I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister as to what his views are on this matter because I do not think it is the intention of most trade unions to allow Black trade unionists&#x2014;they lack experience in any case&#x2014;simply to overpower the existing regis tered unions in the industrial councils.

<p>Sir, we are aware that the hon. the Minister has gone out of his way to seek co-operation from organized labour, and that he has achieved a large measure of success is undeniable. I should also like from this side of the House to ask that section of organized labour which has not yet co-operated with the hon. the Minister to look anew at the report. I want to ask them to open their hearts and their minds afresh to see the good things it contains and to take the interests of South Africa into account, without disregarding their own interests, and to investigate ways and means to ensure that when the legislation is introduced the vast majority of our worker community will go along with it. When I ask that of organized labour, I also ask that the hon. the Minister should keep his communication channels open for that section of organized labour which up to now has not seen its way clear to join him. This is such an important road for the prosperity of South Africa and for all of us, hon. Senators on the other side included, that I think a great responsibility rests on all of us to leave no stone unturned in obtaining the maximum co-operation from organized labour.</p>
<p>I want to say here today that the paths of the NP and organized labour started from the earliest years and have continued together. Those of us who have had a long history on the Witwatersrand, which is our main source of organized labour, the Vaal Triangle complex, know what a close connection there was, and hopefully still is, between a large section of our worker community and the NP. I want to express the hope and the trust today that that historic tie will not be disturbed by any sort of circumstances either through misunderstanding or because of insufficient channels of communication. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that I wish him strength in his task to obtain the maximum co-operation of organized labour.</p>
<p>I want to come to the second leg of labour. You know the old proverb, Sir: &#x201C;Great minds think alike; fools seldom differ.&#x201D; Without having considered this at caucus level I like the name &#x201C;Department of Labour and Manpower Development&#x201D;. In the nature of things Labour has a sentimental connotation for our workers. That is labour as it is, in its essence, in its heart&#x2014;labour ennobles! Where will one find a finer expression, Sir, than labour ennobles?</p>
<p>I should like to concentrate on the second leg, viz. the question of manpower development. I am not going to discuss the legislation which will be introduced. We will have enough time for that. I want to dwell for a while on two problems today, two bottlenecks in our manpower development. We have referred to these on previous occasions in this House; we have advanced certain suggestions but up to now without the necessary success. Today is the first time I have discussed this particular aspect of the Labour Vote, and I want to express the hope that our Minister, who has the interests of labour and manpower development at heart, will give the necessary attention to the two bottlenecks I want to bring to his attention.</p>
<p>The one is well known, and that is the question of unemployment. We cannot emphasize strongly enough that in the next 20 years the greatest socio-economic task of the Government will be to provide sufficient job opportunities for our people. I always say that riches are not a right; riches are a privilege. But job opportunities are not a privilege, they are a right. Therefore a great responsibility rests on the government of any country to give this matter, which is a great problem at the moment, the thorough attention it deserves. Let me say right at the outset that it is a world problem today, but a particular problem here in South Africa where a series of factors are responsible for it One of those factors is that South Africa has a tremendously high birthrate. South Africa&#x2019;s birthrate is at least 50% higher than that of the rest of the world. In the case of South Africa the birthrate, for White and non-White, is in the region of 2,7% per year. In the case of West Germany, for instance, it is 0,7% per year, in Australia it is 1,6% per year and the latter is a country which is comparable with South Africa. We know that one of the greatest problems which will aggravate our unemployment problem in future will be the high birthrate. This is not simply the task of the Minister of Labour, Sir. It calls for communal effort. As I see the position, Sir, it is the joint task of the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Economic Affairs, the Minister of Mines and the Minister of Labour. That is more or less how I see this question of responsibility for this task because it embraces all the factors for generating production. I ask if the time has not arrived for us to consider this problem in depth. I asked this in the past, and I ask it again today. It is obvious that there are also other aspects involved. The Economic Advisory Council of the hon. the Prime Minister announced recently that in its view the immediate solution to or method to assist in surmounting this immediate problem as quickly as possible, is a higher economic growth rate. That is so, with the accent on &#x201C;immediate&#x201D;. But there are other aspects connected to this problem in the long term. One of them is our high birthrate and we shall have to do something about it. Secondly, there is the maintenance of a higher growth rate. The third is that we must strive for a lower inflation rate. The fourth aspect is a problem facing the whole world, what we call structural unemployment as a result of mechanization. I should like to quote something in regard to the mines. In an article dated 27 April 1979 in the <i>Financial Times</i> of London, they report on South Africa&#x2019;s coal industry. The heading reads: &#x201C;South Africa&#x2019;s growing reliance on coal&#x201D;, and it reads, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">In 1965 the coal industry employed 81 000 people. The labour force in 1976 was only 83 000. Within the last 13 years miing has switched from mainly hand-got methods to mechanical systems. Had the old methods been maintained it is calculated that the labour force today would need to be about 145 000.</block>
<p>It could have been 145 000, while it is only 83 000. That is the problem. I do not maintain this is wrong, but the implementation of expensive mechanical methods causes an intensification of the problem in South Africa of a high unemployment figure and insufficient employment. Only an in-depth study by organized labour, industry and commerce and the departments concerned can solve this problem. I want to ask again whether the time has not come to appoint a working committee, not so much for the immediate problem but to examine the intermediate and the long-term problem. We know in South Africa how important sufficient job opportunities are for the welfare and peace and prosperity of the country. We know that. I need not over-emphasize that today. We talk about it but I feel we should do something about it. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was predictable this afternoon that we were not going to have a debate. However, I think it is a great shame that that should be so. I know that the hon. gentlemen on the other side wish to debate the Wiehahn Commission to the same extent as the devil would want to drink holy water! Nonetheless, to endeavour to carry on a debate this afternoon otherwise than on the so-called Wiehahn Commission report, would be like trying to perform Hamlet without the ghost. [Interjections.] It does not matter who asked for it, that is what it is. We are here to debate labour and what is the most outstanding question as regards labour in South Africa today? It is the Wiehan Commission. That is what we should be talking about and that is what I am going to talk about.</p>

<p>The commission&#x2019;s report no doubt constitutes the Magna Carta of South Africa with regard to its industrial relations. It is probably one of the most important documents that has ever seen the light of day in this country. [Interjections .] The implementation of the recommen dations of this commission will undoubtedly lead to industrial peace and economic prosperity such as we have never known in South Africa before today. It will make the confrontation that we all fear among the races in South Africa, in particular between Black and White, far more difficult. It will also have far-reaching repercussions for good in South Africa as regard the economic, social and political life of South Africa. As has already been pointed out, by the hon. lady Senator on our side who is an authority on industrial relations in this country, one of the most important aspects of this matter is that it will do an immense amount of good and has already done an immense amount of good for South Africa as far as international relations and the international attitude towards South Africa are concerned. I think the hon. the Minister will be the first to admit that that is so.</p>
<p>I think this is the first time in my life&#x2014;it is certainly the first time in this Parliament&#x2014;that I have been placed in the position where I must thank an hon. Minister and I do so today quite willingly and quite happily. I thank the hon. the Minister and his Government for the acceptance of the recommendations of this magnificent report. It seems to me, as far as the attitude of the hon. gentlemen on the other side is concerned, that this is the one occasion when we are going to have a debate in which each and every one of them who stands up on his hind legs, will not say: &#x201C;Ek dank the Minister.&#x201D; I doubt if anyone of them can honestly say from the bottom of his heart that he thanks the hon. the Minister for accepting these recommendations! [Interjection.] The changes that have come, have come just in time. It is most ironic that the Nationalist Party which the hon. members on the other side represent, has now repudiated the whole of its past in industrial relations, on the question of labour, absolutely and completely. It is a truism in political life that a party cannot repudiate its past and survive. It has yet to be seen whether this Nationalist Party will be able to do what politics the world over have proved to be impossible.</p>

<p>One of the amazing things about this report and the recommendations therein, is that it recommends almost every point, almost every recommendation, almost every policy that the UP, to which party we on these benches belonged in the past, made over the years. As long as I have been in Parliament that has been the position. What was the attitude of the hon. gentlemen on the other side to the proposals that we made and to the policies that we had which we now find ensconced in the report? We had to endure the scorn of those hon. gentlemen as well as their derision and out-and-out opposition and attack by them. Over the years we have experienced that. [Interjection.] It was on the policies which have now been reversed by the recommendations of this commission that the Nationalist Party won election after election.</p>
<p>It was on that policy and by virtue of the fact that what they said they stood for was the White man&#x2019;s interests as opposed to those of the Blacks. Because they exploited the fears of the White man they were able to obtain the support of the White electorate in election after election in ever-increasing numbers. Now they have lost that, Sir. [Interjections.] Those hon. gentlemen who are making such a noise on the other side, are the same hon. gentlemen who used to say of our policies&#x2014; the same policies that are now set out in this document before us&#x2014;that if they had to be put into operation, they would open the floodgates. How many times did I have to listen to those words&#x2014;they would open the floodgates in South Africa. It would end in the destruction of the White man; it would mean the end of the White man and the end of the White worker. And now, Sir, we have the most extraordinary situation that this Nationalist Party is going to vote in unison with us when the different Bills come before us in order to put into operation the recommendations of this report. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>They are going to do the very thing that they said years ago they would never do. They have said year after year, for 30 years, since they have been in power, that it would mean the end of the White man. And what are we going to have, Sir? The one Bill after the other will be laid upon the Table and they will be voting like sheep in support of them. [Interjections.] Now, Sir, all this disruption they have brought about has come to an end. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senator has just said the NP repudiates its past. I just want to tell him this. That is one of the problems we have with the Opposition. They are always either ahead of or behind the times. But the NP believes one thing and that is to do the right thing at the right time. [Interjections.] The right thing at the wrong time is also wrong, but the right thing at the right time is correct. We have to do new things in the light of the times we live in. The NP is a party which is moving ahead, not backwards. Unfortunately, the history of that party is one of retrogression. The reason is clear, Sir. One only had to listen to the hon. Senator.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to the subject I was dealing with when I spoke just now. I referred to the unemployment question and what it meant. I asked that we should look at it in depth and that we should do so mainly with an eye to the long term. I want to mention a second point closely related to this which I think is important. This is of great importance and this is the first time I have spoken to the hon. the Minister of Labour in this connection. Sir, one of the socio-economic bottlenecks in South Africa is that the efficiency of our economic life is still at a low level. This is understandable when one looks at the population composition and our history, the fact that we are still a young country etc. This is a problem everybody is talking about. I think it is obviously one of the matters on which there is general unanimity. This is namely the necessity for a higher efficiency in our economic life. But I do feel it is a matter we must tackle decisively. The National Productivity Institute is working in this direction. I want to make the statement again, however, that we need a more comprehensive and incisive effort to combat this aspect. I want to quote from the latest annual report for the year ended 31 March 1978 of the National Productivity Institute. It reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">R137 miljoen van hierdie daling kan toegeskryf word aan laer arbeidsproduktiwiteit terwyl &#x2019;n verlaging in die produktiwiteit van die materiaal verantwoordelik was vir R546 miljoen.<br/>Dit is duidelik dat &#x2019;n toestand aan die ontwikkel is waar Suid-Afrika dit steeds moeiliker sal vind om met ander lande op die internasionale mark mee te ding. &#x2019;n Positiewe stap wat gedoen kan word om the onguntige toestand the hoof te bied, is om die produktiwiteit van al die produk-siefaktore te verhoog.</block>
<p>Sir, this also relates to the question of unemployment.</p>
<p>Sir, a lot has been said elsewhere and in this hon. House about Germany. Do you know that Germany&#x2019;s total exports exceeded those of America for the first time in 1978? This is regarded internationally as a piece of economic history. The small West Germany has surpassed the mighty America. We know that that country has been destroyed twice and has arisen again. Today it is regarded as the strongest country financially and economically in the world. How did that country manage it? We have asked this question time and time again. We can learn something from the Germans, Sir. We must look at what they are doing, at what their approach is. Sir, for the first time I have managed to obtain a book which says something in that connection. The title of the book is <i>The Roots of Inflation: The International Crisis</i>, and it is written by eight important economists. The various countries in Western Europe are dealt with here. The following is said about Germany&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The behaviour of labour leaders in the Federal Republic is somwhat different than that of labour leaders in other industrialized countries. The concern that excessive increases in wages may be a cause of unemployment has been at least in the past greater among German labour leaders than among labour leaders elsewhere.</block>
<p>Sir, if one wants to look at results, one sees that the inflation rate in Germany from 1975 to 1978 was only 11%, and that was over a period of three years. In a country like America it was 18%, in the United Kingdom 47%, in New Zealand 47%, in Australia 36% and in South Africa 34%. To what do the Germans ascribe their success? It was only 11% over a period of three years. Sir, do you realize what a low rate that is? We should learn something from the Germans. In this book one finds an interesting description. The success lies with the German nation. They learned that they had to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. That is the approach of labour, the approach of the employer and the employee.</p>
<p>Sir, on previous occasions I have asked in the House that we should reconsider our approach. We should learn from childhood what is really meant by labour compensation according to labour achievement. We should educate our children at school in this direction. I asked this previously of the hon. the Minister of National Education and I now ask it of the hon. the Minister of Labour. Could he use his influence with that Minister? I do not know who will be appointed to that post. We must bring the idea of compensation according to labour achievement home to the people in a good way. I do not know how it can be done; our educationists will know better than I do. But I shall continue to maintain that we must do something about this. The hon. the Minister with his persistence and influence can play a major role because this idea affects him particularly and fits in with his thinking. He could make a big contribution to getting something done in this connection.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, it is really remarkable that countries which are efficient such as Germany, have succeeded in making their unemployment figure the lowest in the world. Do you know why? It is because they have realized that their domestic market is too small and that they should therefore devote themselves to creating job opportunities for their own people by exporting their products. And when we remember that their birthrate is as low as about 0,8% against 2,7% in South Africa, we realize what great problems this creates for South Africa. South Africa with its large mineral and agricultural resources has a golden opportunity to provide for the refinement of her raw materials and minerals and she will have to follow this path, viz. to intensify and strengthen its ability to compete by means of greater efficiency. In the first place we must be able to compete and in the second place we must manufacture the right commodity of the required quality at the right price. That is all that is necessary, Sir. In the third instance we must have the correct organization and methods to make our products known to buyers overseas. As I have already said, South Africa possesses all the raw material resources and the entrepreneurs but we must give attention to our efficiency. Otherwise, as the National Productivity Institute predicts, we shall price ourselves out of the market; we shall not be able to compete on world markets. And that is where our potential lies because our markets in South Africa are in the nature of things restricted. But in the world abroad we have a bigger market and, as I have already said, we have the potential and we must work at it with determination.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, when I speak of a working committee aimed at combating unemployment, I see as a corollary to this a working committee which will make an in-depth investigation into the question of efficiency. In this way our competitive ability will be increased and intensified against competitors overseas.</p>
<p>I want to conclude by saying that in the &#x2019;sixties this country experienced golden years which we shall obviously only ever equal again with difficulty. Of course, one does not know; perhaps they can again be equalled, but it will be difficult. Since then it has become gradually more difficult to maintain the required level of development but with the potential at our disposal and with the mass of unskilled labour we can train at a faster rate. South Africa has an economic future which few other countries in the world have, if we can surmount this major problem of ours of bringing about greater efficiency. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must hand it to the hon. Senator Dr. Visser that he did at least endeavour to try to reply to me. He said one thing that could be said for the Nationalist Party, that it does the right thing at the right time, meaning, of course, that this time they have agreed to or accepted the recommendations of this commission. Well, Sir, what they should do and what I suggest to the hon. Senator Dr. Visser that he should do, is to read the recommendations and he will find that time and time again they make it quite clear that these things should have been done years ago. These things that the commission now recommends be done, should have been done years ago. That is the one thing that stands out in this report. They make it quite clear too that as a result of the policies of the Nationalist Party to which we have been subjected in the past, race relations in this country have been affected most adversely.</p>
<p>Sir, I do not intend to follow the hon. Senator on his sideshow; I want to get back into the main arena, and the main arena of course is the report of the so-called Wiehahn Commission. To commence with, I want to deal with the matter of Black workers and trade unions, one of the most important aspects covered by this report. One of the most interesting matters in this report regarding this particular sector of the report, is the minority report of commissioner Nieuwoudt. I would like to read it, Sir, because here we have the authentic voice of Nationalism speaking; the authentic voice that spoke up to yesteryear; the authentic voice that has spoken up to the present time. This is what we read in the report&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">3.37. Commissioner Nieuwoudt dissented from the Commission&#x2019;s view that Black workers should not be prohibited from joining trade unions. In his view the registration of Black trade unions in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, 1956, and/or the admission of Blacks to registered trade unions is undesirable for the following reasons:<br/>3.37.1. The activities of Black trade unions will inevitably extend beyond purely labour matters and are bound to spill over into the political and social spheres, leading to untenable pressures.</block>
<p>How many times in the past have we not heard this from the benches opposite, Sir? And now what does the commission say? What does it find? It finds that there is overwhelming evidence that there is no basis for that belief. The minority view goes on&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">3.37.3. Black trade unions are more likely to make unreasonable demands than existing trade unions, with detrimental effects on the position of those persons who at present enjoy trade union rights and on the economy in general.</block>
<p>Again this is denied by the overwhelming weight of evidence that was brought before the commission. The minority view states further&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">3.37.4. The admission of Blacks to registered trade unions will result in their being swamped, with concomitant erosion of the vested rights of other groups who at present enjoy registered trade union rights.</block>
<p>I said, the last time I was on my feet, that that is precisely what we have heard time and time again from the hon. the Minister of Labour and from his sycophants who sit on the other side of the House&#x2014;we were going to be swamped in consequence of the admission of Blacks to trade unions. Here we have a complete denial that that is so, and the recommendations of the commission are accepted by the hon. the Minister. Would the hon. the Minister like me to read the portion that accepts this recommendation?</p>

<p>I know that the hon. Senator is not pleased to hear the Government&#x2019;s acceptance of this fact. I accept that he is not pleased. I know that that is the last thing he would like to hear, but nonetheless I am going to read it. The White Paper states on page 11&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Government&#x2019;s deicision at this juncture accordingly is that all persons irrespective of race, colour or sex who enjoy permanent residence in South Africa and who are in fixed employment, will automatically be eligible for trade union membership.</block>
<p>That is what the hon. the Minister and his Government have to say.</p>
<p>Now let us hear what we find in the recommendations of the commission, and in parts these are most interesting, Sir. I would therefore crave your indulgence to enable me to read portions of them. I would, however, first like to refer to Nationalist policy which is the corner-stone of separate development or apartheid, and what they have to say about this. They say in paragraph 3.32 on page 18 of the report&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The permanency of Blacks in our economy is now officially recognized.</block>
<p>They go on to say in paragraph 3.35.2&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It is by now an accepted fact that Black workers are a permanent part of South African economy.</block>
<p>Would the hon. the Minister deny that? Last year it was denied from those ministerial benches. But here is an admission, Sir, and the policy cannot be brought into existence unless that admission is made. But let me go further, Sir. Let me put to you a few of the thoughts that we conveyed to this hon. House over the years&#x2014;and I have been here for 14 years&#x2014;conveying the same ideas. At the time I was reproached and reviled for mentioning such hideous thoughts, but now we find them in this report and now they are accepted by this hon. Minister. I continue to quote from the report at paragraph 3.33 on page 18&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; the commission merely wishes to state its conviction that the fears and emotions expressed in the course of the two inquiries &#x2026;</block>
<p>Here they are talking about the Botha and the Wiehahn inquiry &#x2026;</p>
<p>&#x2026; are not only unlikely to materialize, but in fact pose a far lesser threat than would the continued denial of elementary rights and the perpetuation of the existing uncontrolled situation of proliferation.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>I should like to say at the outset that we extend our congratulations to the hon. the Minister and we most heartily agree with every step he has taken. It is correct to say that we are entering upon a new era in labour relations; that is correct; but in my humble opinion this flows quite naturally from our industrial history and I would like to reflect for a few moments on this particular aspect, with reference to the remarks of the hon. Senator Crook.</p>
<p>At the outset I would say that a form of work reservation has endured on the international scene for centuries. One need only consider the many international treaties and trade agreements which have endured for many years and the years of negotiation between the great nations of the world for the reduction of tariffs and the elimination of preferences to fully comprehend the extent to which nations sought to protect their own labour-intensive industries from competition from countries still at a stage of development which employed labour at a subsistence level wage rate. I think the GATT agreement is a case in point but time does not permit me to deal further with this particular issue.</p>
<p>Let us turn to the situation in our own country and consider firstly the vital years of industrial development in which White artisans and White craftsmen laid the foundations for the creation of South Africa as the workshop of the African Continent, as the mighty industrial workshop of Africa. During this period the short-term underselling on the labour market of the established skilled labour structure by the exploitation of a casual and semi-skilled labour force, more than willing to earn a subsistence wage, would undoubtedly have destroyed the very implements of our industrial survival and industrial growth. It is a fact that circumstances do change, and the occupational structure of the manpower resources of many countries, including South Africa, undergoes change as a continuous process.</p>
<p>This was brought home to me quite forcibly on a recent visit to Britain where it was necessary for me to carry out an inspection of the manufacture of a large turbine for a hydro-electric power station in Southern Africa. In going through the vast machine shops I was struck by the age gap in the labour structure, the labour force. I discussed this with the management who accompanied me at the time. The labourers and the machine shop workers were predominantly in the age group 45 to 60, with a small number of apprentices and an almost complete absence of the age group 25 to 45. Then too, Sir, if one goes through the industrial areas of Britain one sees, for example, that the mighty workshops of Manchester are silent as the intensive labour industries have now found fresh patterns of growth in the developing countries.</p>
<p>This economic displacement is due essentially to the absence in those countries of sufficient labour in the lower categories. In South Africa the occupational structure of the labour force reveals, firstly, a persistent progression of the Coloureds, the Asians and to a lesser extent the Black peoples into the higher occupational categories. But it is fallacious, Sir, to reason that the change has been retarded by Government interference as the essence of the matter lies in the increased demand for goods and services relative to economic growth and the increased labour demand relative thereto as well as the historic-economic circumstances which thus pertained.</p>
<p>During the early stages of the development of South Africa&#x2019;s manufacturing industry the market for goods and services was largely dictated by domestic demand which in turn was principally determined by the consumption needs of White South Africa. I think this is a most important aspect. One may say that this period was characterized by a White labour input to meet the needs of a White oriented market. But as the policy of our Government to uplift all our peoples through education, training and infrastructural development began to show results, so did the purchasing power of the other ethnic groups increase. This reflects an increasing share in the demand for goods and services as the various ethnic groups tend to find a common parameter in standards of living. The process is completely evolutionary, Sir. It will endure until all the people of Southern Africa enjoy comparable standards of living and this will in consequence create a situation where the demand for the supply of goods and services will be predominantly by groups other than the White group. I think this is the vital point. I would say it should be put in this form: Whereas a stable socio-economic situation and, relative thereto, a stable occupational structure of the labour force flows out of the degree of homogeneity of a community or a nation, South Africa realizes that the increasing contribution to the growth in the real gross domestic product by the Coloureds, the Asians and the Blacks demands their participation at all levels of skills in the occupational structure of the labour force. And this is in essence why I say that what we are doing today flows naturally from our history as well as the economic growth we have experienced.</p>
<p>But in all of this it is necessary to add a word of caution. Inasmuch as White skills have made South Africa the workshop of the African Continent, so too our ability to maintain the highest possible economic growth rate will be dependent on the maintenance of a high level of White participation at all levels in the individual branches of industry.</p>
<p>It is therefore necessary to encourage White youths to indenture as apprentices on a far greater scale than endures at present and to ensure White participation to the fullest extent possible in the manpower needs of South African industry in all its facets as a prerequisite for the need to train the vast number of people now entering the labour market, as well as to maintain the standards of quality and productivity. A high growth rate in the real gross domestic product and a related demand for labour which will comply with the object of full employment cannot be achieved without a high level of participation by the White group; neither, Sir, at the same time, can it be achieved unless the full manpower potential of all the peoples of South Africa is involved in all the categories on our occupational ladder and unless these objectives fall within the encompassing parameters of industrial peace, individual welfare and individual security.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry I shall not be able to reply to the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell because I am interested in the Wiehahn Report and the White Paper and I should like to finish my speech.</p>
<p>I should like to say, first of all, that there are matters with which I wholeheartedly agree. The first is the repeal of job reservation. As far as the five reservations which are still in existence, are concerned, this provision may be of benefit and interest to those concerned. However, I can assure the hon. the Minister that in the case of 19 determinations that were suspended two years ago, this definitely did not work and it did not work in many industries prior to that date. I think it will be of great advantage to our image overseas if those people know that no jobs are being reserved here in South Africa. I think that this is in the interests of South Africa and to the credit of the hon. the Minister.</p>
<p>As far as in-service training, military training and industrial relations training are concerned, I agree wholeheartedly with the recommendations. In-service training is necessary and the men who join up and do their military service should receive some consideration. I think some of the apprenticeship periods are far too long. Perhaps the manpower commission could investigate the position to ascertain the period in which people could really be trained because I feel that the apprenticeship periods are far too long. The men who come back from the border should benefit from a shorter training period.</p>
<p>Industrial relations training is of the utmost importance and I am very pleased to see that the hon. the Minister intends to allow freedom of training by employers or their associations, trade unions or federations. They are people who know the industries and they can do a great deal in this regard. We cannot have sufficient people who are properly trained in industrial relations. I agree that institutions should be approved otherwise organizations may just be set up for training and take people&#x2019;s money but do not do the job sufficiently well to enable those people to do the job properly for which they have been trained.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say a few more words about the closed shop. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will reconsider this matter because as far as the trade union movement is concerned&#x2014;the hon. the Minister can ask any union&#x2014;it does not want to give up the closed shop principle. This is of the utmost importance because just as the industrial council system has brought peace to industry so the closed shop system has brought peace. I can tell the hon. the Minister that there have been many strikes in the past in order to achieve the closed shop. We do not want industrial disputes, and we do not want industrial strife; we want industrial peace. We would like to have even greater industrial peace than there has been in the past.</p>
<p>The same applies to trade union subscriptions. Sir, it is only when one is involved in these matters that one realizes what is involved. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that it is almost impossible for most trade unions to collect the subscriptions themselves. The workers contribute very little; in many instances they cannot afford to contribute large sums and consequently the unions cannot afford to employ a large number of people to collect the trade union subscriptions. Sometimes organizations have their shop stewards collect the subscriptions. Ninety per cent of the shop stewards may be completely honest and hand in the money they have collected. But I can assure the hon. the Minister that the remaining 10% do not pay in the money they have collected. The trade unions then have to go to a great deal of trouble in an attempt to try to retrieve the money. As far as I know the employers have not objected to doing the collecting. As a matter of fact it has given the employers and the trade unions a closer industrial relationship than before.</p>
<p>I also welcome the appointment of an industrial court I sincerely hope that this body will be appointed soon. I approve of all the matters that have been assigned to the court but there is one matter that is not completely clear to me and I hope the hon. the Minister will clarify it. At the moment there is no compulsory arbitration. I had the experience recently where the employers did not want to come to an agreement. Deadlock was reached and the trade union suggested that they go to arbitration and that they ask the industrial tribunal to arbitrate. The employers said correctly that they did not have to go to arbitration. But then what alternative is left to the workers? Their only other alternative is strike action. I do not think employers should have the power to force workers to take strike action if the employees are prepared to leave it to an arbitrator and to abide by the decision of the arbitrator which the employers will then also have to accept. I think the workers must have this choice and the employers must not have the right to veto a decision of the workers to ask for arbitration. It may be decided that the hon. the Minister be approached for arbitration, and I think it should be another function of the industrial court to arbitrate in disputes such as this. The matter will then be settled satisfactorily and I usually find that all parties are satisfied with the arbitrator&#x2019;s decision.</p>
<p>Just to end off, Sir, I want once again to thank the hon. the Minister for this report. I have just received the draft legislation. I know some of the recommendations will be implemented in the short term, some in the medium term and others in the long term. For instance, the hon. the Minister has decided not to change the Shops and Offices Act and the Factories Act. I feel it is wise to go somewhat slower with those matters because the workers are not ripe for this and that if there is closer co-operation between the employers and the workers on shop committees and so forth, there will be closer relationship. I wish the hon. the Minister every success. I hope he will succeed with those unions who are still opposed to these recommendations because, as I said at the beginning, their implementation is in the interests of all workers, of the whole population of South Africa and our country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I did not intend taking part in the debate at this stage, but as a result of a certain remark made here I feel compelled to say a few words. Neither do I want to quarrel too much with the Opposition because I should like to enjoy a pleasant weekend and recess. But I do want to say that the NP need not apologize to any previous or present party or to any previous government or to any government to come, for the way in which they have regulated labour relations in this country over the past 30 years. The proofs are there, after all. I represented the biggest labour seat in the country, Vereeniging, in the Other Place. In the Vaal Triangle, which today is the largest labour complex in the country, everybody is so satisfied that our candidates in the past few general elections have not had any opponents. They are satisfied thanks to the Government. There have been no strikes. There has never been any significant dissatisfaction. The new set-up we are now entering upon is the fruit of the enormous industrial development under NP rule and the enormous population explosion.</p>

<p>The matter I really want to raise concerns the argument my friend, the hon. Senator Dr. Visser, raised regarding the enormous industrial development in Germany. I myself and all of us acknowledge the enormous productivity and the enormous development in Germany. But while I am speaking here, a deputation from one of the largest German industrialists is in the country to place orders amounting to millions of rands with certain clothing factories in Cape Town. I entertained them to lunch here. They visited the factories and are so impressed with the working capacity of our people in the factories here that they cannot praise it highly enough. I am not speaking of other manufacturers now, but they maintain that the quality of the clothing which we manufacture here today, just to mention one thing, and the technology connected with it, enables them to export manufactured clothing from here to Germany at a greater profit than they would have made had they made the clothing there themselves or if they had imported it more cheaply from the East. This is to the credit of the workers in South Africa. I think we have one of the best workers corps in the world because there is great satisfaction in the field of labour. We find that the Americans go out of their way to induce us to narrow the wage gap. They do not do that for nothing. With their multinational factories and organizations they have many factories in the East. I was in the Far East recently. They have erected factories there and through cheap labour there they want to compete with us. They do not want us to have successful factories here because we conquer the markets. [Interjections.] No, he has not been there yet. He had already left when I got there.</p>
<p>Then in addition there is the tremendous population explosion in South Africa. I worked for 20 years with the Department of Social Research in Pretoria in the Department of Education. My project was to investigate the shortage of technicians and engineers in the factories. I visited hundreds of factories on the Reef. I found there was no shortage. Last night I read in the newspaper that we now had an enormous shortage of engineers and an anormous shortage of technicians. We cannot draw all the engineers and all the technicians from the small White population to maintain the economy of this country for the next ten, twenty or thirty years. [Interjections.] We do not just rush into things. We do things in a systematic, orderly and responsible manner. If we implement the policy of the Opposition, then we will involve the country in a strike such as the one we had in 1922.</p>
<p>But I predict that because of the tactful manner of the present hon. Minister we shall introduce legislation which will herald a new era for the worker in South Africa, for which we have already paved the way. We must not only defend the rights of the non-Whites; we must defend the rights of all workers. We must not only improve the wages of non-Whites; we must improve the wages of all workers. We must increase production in this country and for that reason we must use the full potential of our labour force. I was in Israel a few years ago. [Interjections.] Yes, I am a man who travels more than Rhoodie does. I was in Israel and we boasted there of our rich gold mines and our variety of minerals. The Israelis told me the wealth of a country does not depend on the minerals in that country but on the labour force, the people who work the country. I am confident that the present Government under the guidance of the hon. the Minister will in the years ahead build up a labour force in South Africa which will be comparable with any in the world in the economic, military, agricultural and other spheres. With the National Party in power South Africa need have no fears for the future.</p>

<p>That little bit of advice from the hon. the Chief Whip should be directed to somebody standing&#x2019; trial in London.</p>
<p>I wanted to follow on the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers when she dealt with the subject of work reservation. I think this is one of the most important subjects that we have to deal with this afternoon and for that reason I should again like to bring it before the attention of this hon. House. I can remember fourteen years ago when I came to this hon. House that the late hon. Senator Trollip was the Minister of Labour as it was then known. I hope the holder of this portfolio will be known as Minister of Labour for many years to come. I remember that the first debate that I ever took part in in this hon. House related to this very subject. Year after year, every time this Vote has been debated in this hon. House, more time has been devoted to this question than to any other point. It has been the great divide between the party that I belong to and did belong to, the UP, and the Nationalist Party. Therefore it should enjoy a very considerable amount of debate from the other side. Because now, Sir, the hon. gentlemen on the other side are turning a complete somersault on this question. After years and years of taking them by the coat tails and dragging them we have at last been able to drag them into our camp. And we are glad to have them with us. We are glad that they have taken this great step.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, I want to read the following recommendation that was made by the Wiehahn Commission and which was accepted by the hon. the Minister and his Government. I quote from page 19 of the White Paper as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Commission therefore recommends &#x2026; that:<br/>the principle of statutory work reservation be abolished, <i>inter alia</i>, by the immediate repeal of section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, 1956.</block>
<p>By the immediate repeal of that section that has been the &#x201C;twisappel&#x201D; between this side and that side of the House for so many years. We are so thankful for this, because the hon. the Minister goes on to say in this White Paper, and I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Government accepts this recommendation &#x2026;</block>
<p>The White Paper then goes on to refer to certain points of view which the commission put forward and which enabled this recommendation to be accepted with a degree of responsibility. Obviously that is what is required; this cannot be done by the stroke of a pen; it must be done responsibly. The commission has indicated the way which the hon. the Minister has accepted. I also want to refer to page 20 where it is said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">These recommendations are accordingly accepted, &#x2026;</block>
<p>I will not quote further because the hon. the Minister knows what is contained in that paragraph Nontheless there is an acceptance.</p>
<p>At this stage, I should like to read to this hon. House from the majority report in regard to this matter. In the minority report once again we hear the authentic voice of Nationalism over the years. I am not referring to just 14 years but to 30 years. I will read to you, Sir, paragraph 3.140 on page 42 because it gives me great pleasure to do so&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Commissioner Nieuwoudt dissents from the Commission&#x2019;s view that the statutory provisions of work reservation should be repealed. His view is based on the following reasons:</block>
<p>Sir, this is just a repetition of what we have heard in this hon. House year after year. But let me read it again in order to refresh your memory, Sir. It is most important in the light of the revolution that is taking place. I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Statutory work reservation is merely the maintenance of the traditional work pattern &#x2026;</block>
<p>How many times have I not heard those words?&#x2014;</p>

<p>These are the words of authentic Nationalism, Sir&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It is this assurance more than anything else that provides the job security which keeps certain groups of workers satisfied and which makes them willing to negotiate with employers in regard to the job advancement of workers of other racial groups in an evolutionary and orderly manner.</block>
<p>An that is now going into the trash can, Sir. The minority report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Statutory work reservation determinations are introduced and enforced with circumspection so as not to cause unnecessary dislocation.

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, once again we have had to listen to a most remarkable performance by the hon. Senator Crook and our time will tell us whether he has already reached his peak in this type of performance or not. He spent a lot of time telling this side of the House that we are not dealing with the Wiehahn Commission report. On the other hand, he spent most of his time in discussing the minority aspects in this report despite the fact that there is great unanimity in this House in regard to the recommendations contained in the report. Sir, how must one understand his reasoning?</p>
<p>*Sir, I want to associate myself with what the hon. Senator Dr. Loock said. In view of the present promising economic climate attention must be paid to industrial development and the development of the markets in our economic hinterland. I want to say a few words in this regard.</p>
<p>In my view this situation calls to an increasing extent for a dynamic attitude to the planning of a higher growth rate in the real domestic product as well as to satisfying the demand for labour in this connection. We can lay down certain requirements for this. Firstly, there must be a well motivated and trained labour force. Secondly, we require good industrial relations which offer both the employer and the employee the necessary protection and which will engender industrial peace. The third requirement is good socioeconomic circumstances for the employees, for instance, housing, schools, recreational facilities etc. Fourthly, there must be the principle of a free market economy. There are certain other relevant factors which can be mentioned but I think that these are the most important.</p>
<p>We on this side of the House believe that the Government is paying particular attention to all these aspects and that we have been successful to a large extent. We believe a good foundation has been laid for the future. As the hon. Senator Dr. Loock so rightly said, there has been a systematic expansion of the marketing of goods and services to markets outside South Africa. I do not intend elaborating on this in detail but I want to draw attention to certain matters of principle in this connection.</p>
<p>The first principle is that costwise our goods must be able to compete with those of other suppliers. This aspect calls for the highest measure of technological expertise and productivity. The second principle is that quality is the decisive factor in the markets in which we want to compete. There is no doubt that quality is a decisive factor in the expansion of export markets, and it is only necessary to compare the pre-war efforts of Japan with their post-war efforts to realize what a decisive role the quality of goods has played in Japan&#x2019;s spectacular industrial development and in her conquering of world markets. The emphasis is placed quite rightly on production and productivity but it would be highly unrealistic to push the question of quality production into the background. It is definitely necessary to apply even stricter standards in respect of all export products, of whatever type, so that South Africa&#x2019;s name will be synonomous with quality. Traditional export countries which I need not mention here, Sir, have relaxed control over the quality of their export products, and in my humble opinion they are plucking the bitter fruits of that policy in an extremely competitive trade situation in the world. That must not be the fate of South Africa. In respect of new markets abroad and the markets we are now entering, we must cling with the utmost steadfastness to what we have already achieved, even if higher productivity suffers somewhat because we want to maintain a higher standard and a higher quality because, as far as exports are concerned, the watchword in my view is quality.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Loock rightly referred to the clothing industry and their special achievements in the export field. We can be proud that this industry has achieved so much. As far as this industry is concerned, it is necessary that high quality be maintained at reasonable cost. In the first place, the emphasis in all branches of industry must be placed on the quality of training and, secondly, on the restructuring of the labour framework to provide for an additional labour level, or whatever we want to call it, which borders on that of the technician. In this way the vertical mobility which is significant in or present labour pattern will not lead to a lowering of the standards of efficiency. Unless the highest possible requirements are set for such a labour level, there is the danger that a situation which will only really be a change of name will lead to unreasonable competition between the semi-skilled worker and the artisan. But if this principle is implemented successfully, a new interest in the trades can be engendered through that section of our total population which we would like to involve the most and who, in such a case, will reap the fruits of quality and productivity.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to discuss another fact which has already been mentioned by the hon. Senator Dr. Loock and the hon. Senator Dr. Visser. This concerns the question of either capitally intensive or labour intensive industrial development which must be encouraged by the State. Let me say at the outset that there is no simple answer to this. Capitally intensive industry is forcing the limited capital investment capacity of our country in a direction which necessarily places restrictions on other important development in the area of our infrastructure etc., which needs large-scale capital investment, while at the same time bringing about an undesirable relationship between labour and capital. But that is not the whole story, Sir. In my view the answer to this is the degree of success which can be achieved by giving free entry to the individual, with good social order, to the labour market, and letting purely economic considerations and principles determine the nature of the industrial development. I have, with a considerable measure of caution, expressed the idea that this must take place within the good social ordering of our communal life which takes note of the political philosophy of our Government and about which there should be no uncertainty in this hon. House.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Labour on the forward step the Government has taken in accpeting most of the recommendations of both the Wiehahn and the Riekert Commissions. It must have called for some courage on the part of the hon. the Minister to have done so. I think he will agree with me&#x2014;he need not do so openly but I think he will agree with me in his heart of hearts&#x2014;when I tell him that by accepting the recommendations, particularly as the responsible Minister, he has seriously jeopardized his chances of being elected Transvaal leader at their next congress. Because it will be difficult for the people in the Transvaal where they still have &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; ideas&#x2014;I prefer to call them that&#x2014;about labour matters to accept the report and its recommendations. As the hon. Senator Crook has just remarked quite correctly, this report is a disavowal of the labour principles that have so far been subscribed to by the Nationalist Party. One would say they were the direct opposite. These and other principles that were recommended in the past by the Opposition parties were rejected and not accepted as Government policy because it was argued that they would lead to total integration in the economic sphere, and that that was contrary to Government policy. I am pleased to see now that economic progress and the growth rate envisaged in South Africa have been given priority and that we are heading in that direction, <i>inter alia</i>, through the adoption of these recommendations.</p>
<p>During his speech the hon. Senator Dr. Visser pointed out that the &#x2019;sixties could be regarded as the golden years in our economic life and claimed that the Nationalist Party Government had adopted these recommendations timeously. I am sorry, but I have to differ from him in this respect. I think they have been accepted too late. We should have started applying this type of principle far sooner. If the hon. Senator will think back to the &#x2019;sixties he will remember that whenever a reasonably high growth rate was achieved, we always came up against the problem of labour. Then the economy had first to cool down so that a period could be entered in which less labour was required and so that the tension that had arisen in the labour market could ease.</p>
<p>A feature of that period was also that productivity could not keep pace with the increase in the employment figure. The reason for that was that either totally unskilled or semi-skilled people were employed to do skilled work while they were not trained to do that work. That was the reason for the cost of living figure which is still with us today. There was no competition on the labour market. The demand for labour was much greater than the supply and that was one of the reasons that prevented us from developing and expanding at that time. There were other factors as well, but this labour question was the main one. I predict that we will reap the benefits of this in the future and that they will be sound benefits, but we will have to be patient. We need more than one or two years in order to train people; it will take a good few years to train them properly and for them to become proficient in their trades. I foresee, therefore, that we will have to wait for at least three years before we will reap any benefits from the policy recommended in the report that is now to become Government policy.</p>
<p>There is another recommendation that pleases me. I do not know whether this has already been referred to today. I think it is contained in the recommendations of the Riekert report, namely, the fact that that portion of the Planning Act which determines the ratio between White and non-White workers, especially in the metropolitan areas, will be repealed so that there will be a free flow of labour. I believe that one of our major tasks today is to provide jobs for the Black masses who constitute the largest section of our labour force. This may meet the problem to some extent but it will help to ease the position. What it will do in particular, Sir, is that it will ease the tension in our relationships with the Black workers. If they know that they are free to compete on the labour market as equals and on merit as well as in regard to their productive capacity and not on the basis of the colour of their skin, there will be far less tension among the Black workers and we shall have built a wall and a bastion against the onslaughts of agitators and communists.</p>
<p>In conclusion I just want to say to the hon. the Minister that throughout the years we who have taken part in debates of this kind have very often differed and differed drastically. We have vehemently argued our differences and approaches to labour legislation. While I have referred to relationships and the easing of tensions as far as these recommendations and their acceptance are concerned, I can honestly say today that I have no fault to find with the new labour policy of the Government. As far as that is concerned, I think one of the old debating points and one of the arguments that has always existed between the Opposition and the Government has now been eliminated. I suppose we shall argue in future about the application of this policy. That we can do but the acceptance of this policy by the Government is a major step forward. The Government have often in the past accepted certain aspects of Opposition policy but on this occasion they have accepted one of the major aspects. Now that they have accepted it, however, they have destroyed a pillar, a corner-stone on which apartheid has rested and they are now contributing to the destruction of that policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to deal with a remark made by the hon. Senator Crook earlier today. I agree with him in regard to one of his remarks, namely, that &#x201C;changes have come just in time.&#x201D; I repeat, I agree with him; we believe the time is ripe for the changes that have come; as a matter of fact, the NP always does the correct thing at the correct time. That is not news neither is it strange. The hon. Senator said further: &#x201C;The Nats have repudiated their past&#x201D; No, Mr. Chairman, the NP is a growing and dynamic party that keeps pace with the times, a party that makes a study of what changed circumstances demand of it and makes the necessary adjustments. Once again there has been reference to the acceptance of &#x201C;UP policy&#x201D;. I find that a very interesting story because I should like to know why this wonderful &#x201C;United Party&#x201D; has disappeared. What has happened to the party that looked so far ahead, the party that wanted to do the correct thing so long ago? Why has it disappeared?</p>

<speech by="#joubert">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. J. JOUBERT</person>:</from>
<p>Why did that party become so insolvent that it had to change its name? They are continually telling us that we are copying them and taking over their principles but they have even gone so far as to incoporate this party&#x2019;s policy, namely, that of becoming a republic, into their name. They have assumed that name in spite of the fact that they vehemently opposed the idea of our becoming a Republic in the &#x2019;sixties. Today they boast about the name &#x201C;Republic&#x201D;, a name that makes us so proud and happy in this country. They are certainly not in a position to talk about other people copying them.</p>
<p>Reference has been made to the White man and everything centred round him. I cannot find any fault with the White man&#x2019;s desire to safeguard his position and to look after himself in the first instance. I cannot find any fault with that whatsoever.</p>
<p>Then the hon. Senator spoke about the &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D; who would have to vote in favour of this against their will. Mr. Chairman, what sort of wishful thinking is that? What kind of an attempt is that to look for disunity in our party, a party that has been so united, so absolutely united, particularly as far as this matter is concerned? I can give him this assurance: I am at least a member of this group. We have discussed the Wiehahn report for a long time and never has there been any discordant note; there has never been any dissenting vote in respect of the ideas embodied in the Wiehahn report which, as a matter of fact, the party has accepted.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel spoke about the tension in the labour market. Perhaps I am not as sensitive as he is to such tensions because I think there has been relatively little tension in South Africa. Over very many years South Africa has achieved a great deal in keeping tension as low as possible under very difficult circumstances and in maintaining peace and contentment on the labour market in South Africa. Although I am not an authority on the subject, I just want to say that I am intensely interested in the labour question because this is one of the most important matters in our country. There is no doubt about it, of course, that labour is one of the most important pillars on which a country&#x2019;s economy is built. We have had labour peace in this country in spite of complex circumstances which I do not think obtain anywhere else in the world. That does not come about by itself; there are reasons for it. In spite of the complex nature of our racial composition, especially in the labour market where people of different language groups and different colours mix, I think the good relationship that exists among the various population groups is one of the main reasons, in the first instance, why we have labour peace in this country.</p>
<p>In the second instance, to come nearer home, we have a good Minister. We know that he has tackled every portfolio that he has been given with energy and determination, that he has studied it and has made a success of it.</p>
<p>We have also had good legislation which is about to be replaced but that legislation has served its purpose well over a long period and the results are evident in the labour peace we have. I want to go further and give the hon. the Minister the credit for this. The question of labour is not of a localized nature. It has ramifications overseas as well. These days we do not have many friends in the world but in spite of this and in spite of trade unions overseas, the hon. the Minister has to a-large extent succeeded in establishing a relationship with international trade unions and international labour that has always enabled us to export our products. I regard that as a great achievement.</p>
<p>I have referred to our previous legislation but time moves on, Sir, and the time for new legislation has arrived. A great deal has already been said in certain circles about the objectionable job reservation legislation. It is true that this legislation served a good purpose at the time but it is also true that while this legislation is still on the Statute Book it has for all practical purposes not been applied for years. In fact, it is an Act which has proved to be useless. Time has made it necessary for us to change this legislation. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on having appointed the Prof. Wiehahn Commission timeously and we are grateful to them for the excellent work they have done in a relatively short period of time in connection with an exceedingly complicated and comprehensive matter. We are very pleased to have the first report of the seven surveys they have made and that legislation in respect of their recommendations will be introduced.</p>
<p>I want to quote something from the White Paper and in this respect I also want to congratulate the hon. the Minister. I think this is a useful and timeous White Paper that speaks for itself, that speaks in clear terms and that indicates the road ahead very clearly to us. I just want to quote something to indicate the attitude that is adopted in this White Paper, namely, that the changes will be applied step by step in an evolutionary and circumspect manner. I want to quote one paragraph from page 5&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">In keeping with free enterprise principles and the endeavour to involve all population groups in the practical realization of these principles, the Commission advocates maximal self-governance by the employer and employee parties, maximal decentralization of negotiation and decision-making, and minimal state intervention in the essentially private relationship between the two parties.</block>
<p>They go on to talk about a system of negotiation and consensus, equality of treatment and so forth. These are all things which give one confidence and assurance that this legislation will be applied without causing any friction or any problems.</p>
<p>Although my ten minutes have not yet expired, Sir, I am told that my time is running out. In conclusion I just want to say that I like the sound of the proposed new name. I think it is very descriptive of the department and I think it will be well received. It is in fact a good name-change.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when I was last on my feet I gave the hon. Senator Steyl an undertaking that I would refer him to a portion of the report which indicated that his interjection was misplaced. As you will recollect, Sir, I was referring at the time to the minority report of Commissioner Nieuwoudt and I want to read that portion of the report which preceded the interjection in order to refresh your mind, Sir. Paragraph 3.140.2 on page 42 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Statutory work reservation is necessary to ensure inter-racial harmony in the work place, particularly in view &#x2026;</block>
<p>It was at that point that the hon. Senator interjected by saying that it was true. I said I would indicate that this report threw that concept into the trash bin. I want to refer you, Sir, to paragraph 3.129.1 on page 41 as my authority for saying so. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">First and foremost and contrary to the original intent of preventing friction between population groups in practice it has been, and still is, immensely injurious to sound race relations in South Africa.</block>
<p>That was why I said at the time that the hon. Senator should not be on those benches because that concept has been thrown to the four winds.</p>
<p>I should like to address this hon. House on a number of other points and I promise you, Sir, that this will be the last I will say in connection with this report.</p>

<p>All right, you can have it all! Apparently the officials of the Department of Labour gave evidence before the commission because the report states in paragraph 3.126 on page 40&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Department of Labour cited a number of reasons, the essence of which was as follows &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">An immediate reason for the introduction of work reservation was the decision to bring about the separation of races in trade unions.</block>
<p>There the cat is out of the bag, Sir! That was the reason why section 77 was included. It was included because of apartheid!

<p>That is what we have been trying to find out for the past 30 years, Sir. Let that hon. Senator get up after I have finished speaking and tell us what apartheid is! That is what we have been trying to find out. There has been no definition of apartheid. We have heard it called separate development, separate freedoms and a hundred and one different things, but we know what it means! [Interjections.] I agree with the hon. Senator Swane poel that this is one of the instances where the corner-stone of apartheid is crumbling&#x2014;the acceptance of the report of the Wiehahn commission.</p>
<p>There are one or two other points which I think should be made. The first relates again to what the NP has done&#x2014;and I am only too happy that they have done it&#x2014;and that is that they have taken over our policy. I am only too happy that they have done so, Sir. As the hon. Senator Swanepoel has said, there is now no further division between the parties on this ideological question. And I am only too happy to be able to say so, Sir. I and my party will give our full support to the hon. the Minister when he introduces the legislation which is necessary to implement this report and the reports that will follow.

<block name="quote">Its existence is no longer tenable &#x2026;</block>
<p>That is in reference to work reservation&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; in view of the developments on the labour front affecting labour workers. The provision of more training facilities for Blacks, the improvement of their educational level; their increased vertical mobility in sectors not covered by work reservation determinations; and the growing unemployment amongst Blacks, particularly educated youths.</block>
<p>I have seldom if ever read a report which is as well-documented, which is more logical and which brings stronger arguments for its implementation than this one does. It is a magnificent report. These are the sentiments that we on these benches have expressed from time to time. It goes on&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Work reservation, both in principle and application, continues to do tremendous harm to South Africa&#x2019;s international image.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank hon. Senators most heartily for the debate we have had this afternoon. This has been the second occasion on which I have been called to come here and to take charge of a debate on labour matters. I must admit that each occasion has been a very pleasant one and I am deeply grateful to hon. Senators.</p>
<p>Before I reply to any of the points raised, I just want to say that in politics one learns something every day and I noticed something new here today, namely, that an hon. Senator can talk without knowing really what he is talking about. That is the hon. Senator Crook, of course. He was very friendly and I thank him for his friendliness. I want to ask him, however, seeing that he indicated in his speech this afternoon that the National Party had accepted his party&#x2019;s policy, to read the report once again. Then he will realize what the underlying tone in the report is. That underlying tone is that all workers, White workers included, should be afforded meaningful protection in South Africa. The fact that section 77 is being repealed and replaced by an improved form of protection is still in accordance with National Party policy; as a matter of fact, that is a manifestation of National Party policy, a party that is doing a better job every day. That is a fact, Sir. However, I do not want to spend too much of my time on the hon. Senator because we have also had many sensible speeches from that side. I refer to the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. I want to thank her for what she has said. She discussed a number of subjects this afternoon. Before I go any further, however, I want to say immediately that the fact that the report of the Wiehahn Commission has been tabled and that the legislation in keeping with it has not yet been discussed either in the Other Place or here, places me in a somewhat difficult position because I have been asked to discuss legislation which has not yet been introduced. Now I want to give an undertaking. Because the points were raised in a spirit of goodwill and are important points that will be raised and have to be dealt with when we discuss the legislation, I shall make a point of it, when the Second Reading debate takes place, to reply to the arguments advanced by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers&#x2014;I have made notes of those arguments&#x2014;instead of dealing with them today.</p>
<p>I also want to thank hon. Senators for the pattern the debate has taken and instead of replying to all the details raised by hon. Senators, as is customary, I shall rather try to deal with all the matters raised as a whole and in my reply follow the patterns they have set.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators on both sides of the House have referred to the change in the name of the department It is not easy to turn one&#x2019;s back on a name that has been part of Parliament and of the department and of the workers in South Africa for so many years. In the days in which we are living we have passed beyond the stage of labour. In fact, we have reached the stage of manpower development. That is the stage that we have reached. It was a fitting name in those days. However, hon. Senators will agree with me that throughout the world a dynamic element has developed in modern communities, an element which has become part and parcel of large-scale labour development and which takes this development into account.</p>
<p>I do not want to philosophize on this, however, except to say that in Europe, for example, the development has also been in the direction of manpower development. In South Africa, however, we prefer to attach a good connotation to the concept of labour unlike many countries in the world where that is not done because trade unions have bedevilled labour matters there. I just want to remind hon. Senators of the labour struggle in Great Britain between the Labour Party and the trade unions as well as the labour struggle in South America and many other countries. The word &#x201C;labour&#x201D; is no longer such a popular name, therefore. But apart from that, Sir, the new South Africa is concerned with the total development of the manpower of its peoples and their training. It is no longer a question of simply finding employment for someone and arranging what he should do in the workshop. We are now concerned with the development of South Africa, the training of the people of South Africa; in fact, the main objective is upliftment Finding a job for someone will become a secondary consideration in the days that lie ahead. I think, therefore, that to change a name is also a development in this field in South Africa. What is more, I prefer the new name and consequently we accepted the recommendation of the commission immediately.</p>
<p>To dispose of the minor matters first, I want to reply to the hon. Senator Scheepers at this stage. She referred to the five categories of job reservation which are still covered by section 77. After consultation with the trade unions, I decided to abolish those as well, and I am not prepared to break my agreement. I do not want to violate their confidence although I may tell the hon. Senator at this stage that the trade unions concerned have already indicated that it will also be senseless to retain those five. It is really senseless. They do not work. One is debateable but the other four do not work and in view of the new machinery that is being created, the trade unions realize that they are getting something much better than what they are relinquishing. I leave it at that for the moment.</p>
<p>The important point raised by various hon. Senators today was in connection with unemployment. The hon. Senator L. J. van den Berg referred, <i>inter alia</i>, to the more than 200 000 Black workers working on the mines and related that to the general unemployment figure. I am still arguing the question of how the unemployment figure in South Africa should be calculated, because it depends on how one does it. However, for argument&#x2019;s sake I am prepared to accept the latest figures of 600 000 and 800 000, according to the basis presently in use. I quite understand the hon. Senator making the point and saying: &#x201C;Very well, there are 200 000 foreign Blacks. Preference must be given to one&#x2019;s own people.&#x201D; Of course we give preference to our own people. However, it called for a gigantic effort on the part of the Chamber of Mines to increase the percentage of their local labour force from 23% to 52% over the past two years. It was a tremendous effort. In the first instance, the local Black people are extremely prejudiced. The Vendas, for example, will not go down a mine-shaft They will never do so. Neither will the Tswanas. President Mangope himself said to me: &#x201C;I have 38 000 Black people. I have my own mines but I can only get 4 000 of my own people to go down the mines. I have to import 34 000 from the countries of Chief Ministers Buthelezi or Matanzima.&#x201D; That is due to prejudice. Apart from prejudice there are numerous other difficulties. I think the percentage that has been achieved after great effort, is good. Mr. Chairman, if it were possible to recruit the balance of that labour force from within our own ranks, why would we go to the trouble of getting workers from Malawi, Mozambique or from wherever it may be? One never knows whether those people will be available the next day. What is more, because of their presence in South Africa, they are costing this country money because they take their wages back with them to their own countries. Everything possible is being done and, in my capacity as Minister of Mines, I have made myself thoroughly acquainted with the position. I am satisfied that every effort is being made to increase the percentage of our local labour force. But we are still saddled with the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>I want to repeat what I said in the Other Place and in public. If any hon. Senator was present when I did so, he must please forgive me for giving the same figures and perhaps advancing the same arguments. We in South Africa are heading for a situation with our eyes open; we can see it coming. That situation is the increase in the unemployment figure in South Africa and the percentages that we are going to have in South Africa in future. Let us view the position against the background of the universe. The fact is that towards the end of this century there will probably be between 1 100 and 1 200 million people&#x2014;that is over one milliard people&#x2014; gradually starving to death all over the world. Throughout the world that figure is probably in the vicinity of 600 million today and the majority of them are in the East. But the firstmentioned figure will be the figure in 20 years&#x2019; time.</p>
<p>To go by the estimates of ethnologists, one can expect that on average there will be 80 million people unemployed on the Continent of Africa. That is a figure of 80 million out of almost 500 million people. That is the number who will be unemployed; they are going to be hungry because of the lack of food and neither will they have a roof over their heads. They will be frustrated and embittered and ripe for revolution. Sir, nothing that anybody tries to do in this connection will make very much difference. To make any difference to the situation one will first have to build an infrastructure at great cost. Money will have to be made available so that the things that form the basis of any manufacturing industry can be established and the people absorbed. Sir, to create an infrastructure within a period of 20 years in order to provide employment for 80 million people, is beyond the ability of the world of today. It cannot be done.</p>
<p>Sir, we are faced with another inexorable figure; this figure relates to human beings and one cannot do anything to change it. While we are planning, the lower, undeveloped groups are multiplying on a large scale at a certain rate. That goes on inexorably. As a Christian one cannot start closing the hospitals and maintain that if one does so the rate of successful births will decline. Neither do we do that; we are Christians. In other words, we give all these factors free rein. Against this background South Africa must look ahead and we must ask ourselves what we are going to do in connection with unemployment. Sir, I can tell you that that is the most awesome challenge we have ever had to face. That is the most important thing. That is why I say that the recommendation of the commission that a Manpower Commission be appointed&#x2014;history will prove this within the next 25 years&#x2014;will in the circumstances probably be one of the most sensible steps on which any Government has had to decide. What else should it do? Sir, one must not look at it as it appears in print. I shall tell you what would be the ideal. That instrument should have built into it the possibility of taking an in-depth look at the entire future situation of training, the placing of people in employment, and regulating and detecting any difficulties and solving them timeously. I think the hon. Senator Dr. Visser also referred to the question of an in-depth look into the future. It must enable us to know what to do with our own eight million people who are to come and who have to have employment. Sir, it is extremely important that such machinery be created. I think the most important recommendation in the whole report is the one which recommends the creation of an instrument that will carry that responsibility.</p>
<p>Sir, one must remember that if it is anticipated that we will have a further eight million people, those eight million people will be of no use unless they have been trained and unless they can be placed in employment. Supposing there is a factory that requires 1 000 workers. One stands at the door to see who is looking for work, but those who are there are raw; they have not been trained to do anything whereas the factory contains machinery that has to be operated. It requires disciplined people to operate that machinery. It is not necessarily a question of their having to be sophisticated but they should at least be able to keep an eye on a machine, be able to count or watch a conveyor belt. It will be of no use whatsoever to have eight million people and to have the necessary money to establish factories when those eight million people are not trained. Capital and untrained people do not go together; that simply does not work.</p>

<p>Training is part of the comprehensive development plan we envisage for the future. When I talk about training, Sir, I do not have university training in mind. Neither do I have college training in mind. I have in mind the training that can be given by the farmers themselves on their farms. In due course a certain worker may become an expert at irrigating and another one at operating a milking machine. These people, therefore, acquire a certain measure of training. Let me put it this way. The entire spectrum of training and of regimenting in order to fit into the over-all machinery with its diversified needs, will become part of it. That is why I say that apart from the problem in the short-term, training and unemployment remain a frightening problem of the future. That is what we shall have to attend to in future. That is what we shall have to attend to by all the means at our disposal.</p>
<p>I could go on, Sir. I could tell you what it would cost per capita to embark on that road. Those are things which colleagues of mine say; those are things that one will hear in this House as well. One can say how much is needed per person to establish some industry or other. All that is true, but that is not what we are dealing with now. I am dealing now with the problem of how to equip the people to meet that situation. I want to add immediately that one must be careful not to fall into another trap. It is customary in this country to be carried away with figures. We think nothing of saying that it costs R100 000 to place one person in employment. We then multiply that amount by eight million and when we arrive at the total figure we take fright and say that it can never be done. But that is not quite what happens. In the final analysis there are many labour intensive industries. However, we must try to avoid one problem that may arise in future. We should be careful not to mechanize where mechanization should rather be delayed and manual labour encouraged. There are many such industries. I am not suggesting that we should concentrate on sophisticated industries in order to compete with a country like America which is a highly mechanized country, while we employ manual labour. However, we must jealously guard and utilize the possibilities available to us. Let me give hon. Senators an example of one such possibility.</p>
<p>In this regard I want to refer to a homeland. I learnt recently that we were importing R30 million worth of tea per annum. Why should we import it from outside? Do you realize, Sir, what a labour intensive industry the growing of tea is? If the mountain slopes of Vendaland were under tea plantations, thousands and tens of thousands of people would be employed. Once a tea plant has taken root properly it costs very little to maintain. It does not cost R50 000 to place one person in a job on a tea plantation. It does not cost as much as that to plant one small tea plant. That is why I say that we shall have to think in that direction in future.</p>
<p>I do not anticipate that the Manpower Commission will be of such a nature that it will be able to dictate to the country how to run its economy. What the commission must do, however, is to assist in seeing how we are to fit into the over-all pattern for the future and how to train our people at the same time.</p>
<p>Another aspect is coupled with this, Sir, an aspect which the hon. Senator L. J. van den Berg and the hon. Senator Dr. Visser have mentioned, namely, that of productivity. If there is one frightening thing we still have to contend with in South Africa, it is the crime of unproductivity in our economic life. Let me express that in figures, Sir. From 1972 till today productivity in West Germany, where the price rise factor was 2,1, has kept pace with a factor of 2,2. In other words, in relation to salaries and wages productivity has kept pace. What was the position in South Africa over the same period? In South Africa the factor in respect of the rise in productivity is 1,5, while the factor in respect of wage increases is 3,5. What would happen if we were to continue along those lines in future? To a certain extent we have had the benefit of cheap, coal, steel and power but due to our own actions steel and power will in future become more expensive than they are in Germany. Therefore, if we have to make provision for the maintenance of a population of 50 million people at the end of this century, people who are not disciplined to the same extent as those in Europe, we shall eventually produce an article that will be so costly that nobody will want it. That is the danger we are facing.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser spoke about efficiency and said that it should be maintained at a high standard in our economic life. For example, when one visits Japan or Germany one immediately gains the impression that everything is geared to efficiency. Efficiency is not something, therefore, that one learns on the factory floor but rather something that is inherent in a country, something with a long tradition; in other words, efficiency cannot be acquired overnight; people have to develop an affinity for it. In other words, the machine, management and worker must synchronize, and that takes time. One gains the impression, however, that too many people controlling the economy in South Africa ignore this aspect, and that is dangerous. In future people will have to become mentally attuned; they will have to acquire labour discipline and be made conscious of the inexorable correctness that our economy demands, otherwise South Africa will not be able to export. What are we doing at the moment? It is argued at the moment that we must not only mine and export our minerals but that we should refine those minerals as well. What does refining mean? It means that stainless steel must be manufactured here. That in turn means that the steel door that is made from that stainless steel must be manufactured here and exported. In other words, we must complete the whole circle and we shall be in that situation within the next 25 years.</p>
<p>How are we going to handle the situation in view of the complicated problems facing us, such as our high unemployment figure, the number of people who have not been disciplined yet and all the concomitant problems? Mr. Chairman, it is easy to talk about all these aspects but these are real and big problems. There are bodies such as the National Productivity Institute and the Human Sciences Research Council in Pretoria, universities and others with which the State is involved and which deal with these matters. Even the CSIR is making an in-depth study of them. Now we are forming an organization called Manpower Development and I think this Manpower Development Board will actually be the watchdog in future that will have to see to it that discipline is instilled into the workers. If anything like that has not yet been envisaged, it will pay South Africa to establish a body of this nature&#x2014;the sooner the better&#x2014;to attend to this aspect of our labour force. If we do not do so, we shall find that we have a number of disjointed committees and boards in the country where everyone does something but where there is no coordination and nobody to indicate the correct road to follow.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the only thing I can do at this stage, therefore, is to express the hope that everybody concerned, the department, industrialists and employees and employers, among others, will work together until a stage is reached where everybody will appreciate the importance of discipline and make that an ingredient of our future preparedness. That then is one of the cornerstones of total strategy for South Africa. When the hon. the Prime Minister talks about total strategy, total security, total independence, a total effort, one should realize that all those aspects form part of labour and labour development and how that fits in as the main part of the whole pattern.</p>
<p>Sir, having dealt with these two aspects, I think, I have followed the tenor of today&#x2019;s debate, because that was the main theme. The hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell asked a few questions.</p>
<p>†The hon. Senator posed a question in connection with the indenture of apprentices and indicated that we could improve our productivity by indenturing more apprentices from different races to become artisans. This is one of the important questions, and as I am speaking now about general training, I also include training on that level. This committee to which I have referred, in conjunction with all the other bodies that will be implicated in future, will naturally have to do a very important thing in South Africa, and that will be to decide who will be indentured to enter the labour market in South Africa and at what rate and when. If we to train all the young people in South Africa in a balanced way, I believe that we need not have any fears for our safety. Indeed, the possibility of ending up at the end of the century with a South Africa able to comply with all the requirements of the time, then becomes a reality.</p>
<p>*The hon. Senator Dr. Loock pointed out the riches a country had in its human resources. There I agree with him. He has obviously referred to this because he had probably also been impressed by the fact that the ordinary things in one&#x2019;s life are of a temporary nature while a good person and a well-trained person is permanent.</p>
<p>Having said these few words, Mr. Chairman, I think I have dealt with everything hon. Senators have wanted me to deal with because I have covered the two important aspects that can cause difficulties in future. I also expect that we shall be able to have a very meaningful discussion on the Wiehahn report in future. In this connection the hon. Senator Dr. Visser has asked me to keep all the channels open. He also made an appeal to the workers to have another look at the report, i.e. those who have so far objected to it, and to co-operate with the Government. However, I can tell hon. Senators that as I stand here I am of the opinion&#x2014;as a matter of fact I am not only of the opinion; I know it is so&#x2014;based on days and weeks of negotiations, that as far as numbers are concerned, in respect of both the percentage of trade unions and the numbers belonging to trade unions, over 95% of the workers in South Africa support us in this matter. But there is one remaining group, namely the mineworkers, who do not support us yet. I may add, however, that over 50% of the mineworkers do not support the leader of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. The miners on the West Rand and in the Western Transvaal support him but those in the Transvaal do not. And just as he failed to persuade a single miner working in a coal mine and in many other mines to go on strike so he will not succeed in doing so in future.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I said that as far as the mineworkers were concerned, over 50% do not support him today. During the past two days, last evening again, attempts were made to hold mass meetings but they were unsuccessful. Another attempt will be made tonight to hold mass meetings in order to organize strikes but all those attempts end in failure, Sir. I do not want to intervene in the affairs of the mineworkers. All I want to say is that they have learnt a lesson. They bumped their heads the other day when they went on strike illegally and lost many benefits. Fortunately, I managed to obtain some relief for them. I want to use the word &#x201C;I&#x201D;, if you will forgive me, Sir, because it was not the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union that managed to get many of their benefits restored. It was the Minister who had to do so. To date the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union has failed to reach proper agreement with the Chamber of Mines. But that is by the way. I hope they will come to their senses in good time and realize that we can move forward if we co-operate. Confrontation will get us nowhere&#x2014;nowhere, Sir. I want to express my deepest gratitude to the thousands of mineworkers who recently refused to be talked into a second strike.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator has returned to the Chamber and I shall reply to his request that channels should be kept open. I shall keep them open as widely as possible. I agree with the sound advice he has given, namely, that those workers who fought a rearguard action against this legislation should have another look at it; I hope they will do so.</p>
<p>Everything seems to indicate that this legislation is strongly supported by the workers in South Africa but we can discuss that when the Wiehahn report comes up for debate. But we have been successful in recent times. I can just tell you, Sir, that there are signs that the international climate is gradually changing in our favour, not so much because South Africa has suddenly become another country but because of another very important reason. Many countries have taken stock of their own position and have realized that in many respects they are more dependent on South Africa than South Africa is dependent on them. I refer in particular to Europe where comprehensive plans have been drawn up for mineral conservation programmes. But the most important people who are concerned about their future are those workers who will be affected if factories have to close down because they cannot import the raw materials from South Africa.</p>
<p>With these few words, Sir, I want to thank you and all hon. Senators most heartily for a pleasant debate.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>A problem is being experienced with the application of section 10(1) (b) of the Forest Act, 1968 (Act 72 of 1968), one which can be solved only by amending the section concerned to the extent indicated in the Bill now before this House.</p>
<p>†Hon. Senators are aware of the fact that section 10(1) of the Forest Act, 1968, was amended by the Forest Amendment Act, 1978 (Act 87 of 1978), to empower the Minister to determine prices for timber in the round according to the basis laid down after consultation with the statutory Forestry Council. It was by no means intended with this legal provision that I should arbitrarily dictate prices for timber in the round if it is at all possible for growers and purchasers of timber to reach agreement in this regard without my intervention. On the contrary, the intention was to prescribe by notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> the procedure to be followed in negotiating the prices of such categories of timber in the round as may be causing dissatisfaction and that, thereafter, I should only intervene in those cases if the negotiations carried out in the prescribed manner, were to break down.</p>
<p>*Now it appears, however, from a legal opinion which was obtained, that the word &#x201C;basis&#x201D; implies an actual formula for determining the price of timber in the round. Apart from the fact that over the years it has proved impossible in practice to lay down such a formula, it was by no means the intention, as I have said before, that a formula should be laid down but merely the procedure which should precede the determining of a price by the Minister.</p>
<p>It is important that the necessary machinery for the statutory determination of prices for timber in the round be established as soon as practicable; and in order to overcome the problem which is being experienced in this regard at present, a further amendment of section 10 of the Forest Act, 1968, is unavoidable. It will be clear to hon. Senators, however, that the principles contained in the section concerned are not affected by the proposed amendment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND ENERGY</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>As is apparent from the long title, the purpose of this Bill is to extend the powers of the council to establish calibrating facilities, to extend the powers of the State President relating to the appointment of the president of the council and to make better provision for the control of the funds of the council and for the recovery of losses and damages caused by officials of the council.</p>
<p>The introduction of quality insurance programmes in the industry has resulted in a strong demand for reducible calibrations of high accuracy. The CSIR is responsible for the national measurement standards and also responsible for making provision for the calibration of precision instruments the accuracy of which is reducible to the national measurement standards. However, reduction requires the issue of a calibration certificate. At present only the SABS, the CSIR and the Commercial Metrology Division of the Department of Commerce are entitled to issue such certificates, while there are also other laboratories in existence which can do calibration work and which can be authorized to issue reducibility certificates.</p>
<p>Clause 1 of the Bill is aimed at authorizing the CSIR to approve other laboratories for the proposed purpose as well. The aim is to establish a suitable mechanism in the form of a National Calibrating Service&#x2014;NCS&#x2014;to monitor the work of other laboratories, to ensure their accuracy and to authorize them to issue calibration certificates.</p>
<p>Clause 2 deals with an aspect I should like to deal with briefly, viz. the appointment of the president of the CSIR. The present president, Dr. C. van der Merwe Brink, was initially appointed by the State President for a term of five years with effect from 5 October 1971. Due to an administrative oversight, the State President was not approached in time for approval of the appointment of Dr. Brink for a further term from 5 October 1976. In order to rectify the situation, it is envisaged by the proposed amendment of section 6 of the principal Act to grant the State President the power to approve Dr. Brink&#x2019;s present term of office as president with retroactive effect from 5 October 1976.</p>
<p>†Clause 3 of the Bill deals with the recovery of loss or damage caused by officers or employees of the CSIR. The Treasury has requested that each statutory body should lay down its own regulations in regard to the recovery of loss or damage. At present the CSIR has no statutory power to recover such loss without a law suit. Mr. President, hon. Senators will observe that the proposed new section in effect determines that if a past or present employee of the Council has caused loss or damage to the Council in a manner as set out, the accounting officer concerned can determine the amount of such loss or damage and order the person concerned to repay the whole or any part thereof within 30 days. Provision is also made for the guilty person to be able to appeal to the Council or a court of law.</p>
<p>As the proposed new section 15(b) specifically refers to the accounting officer of the Council, it is necessary to define these words and also to describe the responsibilities of the accounting officer.</p>

The hon. the Deputy Minister referred to clause 2 in regard to the powers that are being conferred on the State President and he said that in this respect the legislation was being made of retrospective effect. Over the years the Opposition have not always been in favour of this practice but in this particular instance we are not opposed to it.</p>
<p>It is provided further that the President shall be the accounting officer and provision is made for the recovery of losses etc. as explained by the hon. the Deputy Minister. In the circumstances and in view of the fact that we are of the opinion that this legislation will be in the interests of the activities of this particular body, namely the CSIR, we support this measure. We shall also allow all the various stages of the Bill to be taken immediately.</p>

<p>This is not the first occasion on which he has been with us, but I was not privileged on that occasion to welcome him here. I just want to repeat that we are pleased to have him in our midst.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for me to say much about the three aspects that are dealt with in this Bill and to which the hon. the Deputy Minister has referred. The first provision is a highly technical one, namely the &#x201C;calibration of precision instruments&#x201D;. Looking at my hon. colleagues I think there is only one&#x2014;if I may be so personal&#x2014; and that is the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell who will perhaps be able to tell us what that means precisely. But I suppose that is an important function that has to be fulfilled and in view of the fact that the CSIR is so jealous of its good name and the high standard of its work, I realize that there are good reasons for the proposed change.</p>
<p>There is a second aspect which concerns my good old friend, Dr. Van der Merwe Brink, who has been sitting there for a couple of years without his post having been approved. I only hope it was not necessary for him to make do without any salary over the years. I am grateful, therefore, that the hon. Senator Oelrich has also seen the matter in that light and that even a good Government like the Nationalist Party Government can sometimes be guilty of an oversight. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>As far as the third aspect is concerned&#x2014; the hon. the Deputy Minister has also referred to this&#x2014;I gather that amendments of this nature have now become standard practice. As a matter of fact, the CSIR is one of the few remaining bodies in regard to which the Act is being amended in this way. As has already been pointed out, without such a provision there is only one alternative way in which losses of this nature can be recovered and that is by way of legal proceedings. That is still mentioned as a last resort but provision is now being made for other means whereby such losses can be recovered from the officials responsible for those losses.</p>
<p>That is already normal procedure in the case of many other Government departments and consequently we support this amendment. It is not necessary for me to say anything further, Sir, and with these few words we on this side of the House are pleased to support this amending Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. President, as an Independent on this side of the House I rise merely to give my blessing to this legislation for the simple reason that Mr. Brink is such a good person. I am very sorry that this wonderful Government to which the hon. Senator has just referred, has been fast asleep for three years, but I sincerely trust that he did receive his salary.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I am opposed to legislation being made of retrospective effect because we in the Marico district have had a very bad experience in this regard. The hon. the Deputy Minister comes from the Cape Province. For two years the water from Marico was pumped to Mafeking without the Government knowing anything about it. Then they had to pass legislation to make it legal. Basically I am opposed to the principle but because Mr. Brink is such a decent fellow and such an outstanding person, I am pleased to support this legislation. I also want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that we are pleased to have him here with us. However, he will not always find it as easy as he has today to have legislation passed by this House. On this occasion we shall let him off lightly.</p>

In particular I want to thank the hon. Senators Oelrich and Du Toit for the understanding attitude they have adopted towards this highly valued official who is serving South Africa. Dr. Brink is rendering South Africa excellent service and I think it is fitting that we should on this occasion express our sincere appreciation to him as chairman of the council and to congratulate him on the honorary doctorate that is shortly to be conferred on him by Cape Town University. I think he is an official of whom South Africa can be proud and it is that same pride that is being reflected in this House today. The CSIR is a body of which South Africa can be proud. During the industrial revolution that South Africa has been experiencing since World War II, a body like the CSIR has been of the utmost importance. I think we all agree that it is not a body that concerns itself with politics.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>In terms of the National Parks Act, 1976, the management, control and maintenance of our national parks are vested in the National Parks Board of Trustees. The land taken up by national parks, is Government land, and in law no part of it may be alienated, excluded or detached from a park, except on the authority of a resolution of both Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p>The area of some of our parks is really very limited and there is a need for expansion in order to make those parks more viable. The State purchases land for this purpose from time to time, but such purchases depend on the funds available. In order to make additional funds available, the National Parks Board proposed that a fund be established under its control in which voluntary subscriptions, donations and bequests from the public can be deposited. These funds will then be utilized for the purchase of land for the purposes of national parks. The National Parks Board is very confident that such a fund will succeed in attracting considerable sums of money from the public sector. However, the problem is that the National Parks Act, 1976, does not authorize the board to spend funds that are put at its disposal, for such a purpose. In terms of the provisions of the Act the board may only utilize its funds for purposes relating to the control, management and maintenance of national parks.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the wish of the National Parks Board, therefore, amending legislation is required and in clause 1 of the Bill provision is now made for the establishment of the proposed fund. The fund will be controlled and managed by the Parks Board, but the purchase of land will be handled by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. Such land will be registered in the name of the State. Provision is also made for the auditing of the Land Acquisition Fund, by the Auditor-General and the submission of an annual report to Parliament.</p>
<p>†Clause 2 of the Bill amends the definition of the area of the Kruger National Park Firstly, the farm Diepkloof 406 K U and Portion 6 of the farm Klaseriemond 15 K U are now being excluded from the proclaimed area of the Park. The exclusion from the area of the Kruger National Park of these two farms was in fact approved by Parliament in 1962. At that time the said farms, which were cut off from the rest of the Park by a fence erected to restrict the movement of carriers of foot-and-mouth disease, were handed back to the State, together with several other properties, in exchange for certain other land which had previously been acquired and included in the Park. The decision of Parliament in this regard is contained in the report of the Select Committee on State-owned Land which was approved on 12 June 1962 in this House. The boundary description of the Park has unfortunately never been amended with the result that these two farms, which are now under private ownership, still form part of the proclaimed area of the Park.</p>
<p>A further amendment of the definition of the area of the Kruger National Park concerns its north-western boundary. In this area the Luvuvhu River, or as it is also known, the Pafuri River, forms part of the boundary between Venda and the Park. During negotiations with the Government of Venda representations were made that the middle of the river be accepted, in accordance with international practice, as the boundary between Venda and the Republic. After consideration the Government agreed to the request and the boundary of the Kruger National Park as set out in Schedule 1 to the Act will accordingly have to be amended as proposed in clause 2 of the Bill.</p>
<p>*An agreement will be concluded in due course to cover matters such as the upkeep of a common fence for the control of stock diseases, the movement of animals etc.</p>

<p>Mr. President, from the very nature of things, any measure that is obviously in the interests of the national parks of South Africa will be supported by this side of the House. It behoves every good South African to protect such a wonderful asset as the national parks of South Africa. We on this side of the House are very proud of the fact that we can describe ourselves as good South Africans. We are very proud of our national parks and consequently we shall support this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. President, obviously we on this side support the measure which is before this hon. Upper House today. We also value the establishment of parks very highly and we realize the educational value they have. As a matter of fact, I do not think political parties are alone in feeling this way; I think everyone in South Africa realizes the educational and aesthetic value of these parks and their value as a tourist attraction. For that reason we are pleased to support this legislation.</p>
<p>However, at the same time I want to issue a note of warning, namely, that we should use agricultural land very sparingly when it comes to extending parks and nature reserves. Agricultural land should be used sparingly for any purpose other than that of the production of food in South Africa and in Africa. I just wanted to issue this timeous word of warning, Sir. While we like our parks and support the idea of extending them we should also keep an eye on the situation relating to our agricultural land so that not too much of it is used for other purposes.</p>
<p>Apart from that we support this amending Bill because it will improve the boundary lines between our parks and the Black states, especially now that one of those Black States is on the point of becoming independent. I think many problems can be avoided if care is taken timeously to ensure that the borders are clearly defined. As is apparent from this amending Bill the borders will be clearly defined and for that reason we welcome and are pleased to support this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the good news first! I am pleased to notice that the Auditor-General will audit the fund. That is the first point.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am pleased to see that the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure will be responsible for buying the land. Following upon what the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat said, I trust that the hon. the Minister, seeing that he is responsible for the department, will make sure that unless it is properly utilized and is necessary, valuable agricultural land is not purchased. I say this irrespective of how fond we are of our parks.</p>
<p>As far as the borders between independent States are concerned, we now have the bad news. My experience has been that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services whose responsibility it is to erect that kind of border, does not do a proper job. The hon. the Minister knows how important proper borders are in the Klaserie area to which he has referred. It is important because of the threat of foot-and-mouth disease. The red meat producers there are not always very happy about the cautions taken along the borders of the Kruger National Park, in spite of the fact that we support the idea of national parks.</p>

<p>Sir, to be a little more serious, I believe that in certain instances it may perhaps be necessary to purchase additional land for parks. But the hon. the Minister himself is on record as having admitted that we do not have much agricultural land in the country. He knows that very well and that is also what his department says. The consumer public outside is of the opinion that South Africa is the richest country as far as agricultural land is concerned. But that is not so, Sir. We are a poor country from an agricultural land point of view. It is only the fact that the efficient farmer knows how best to utilize his land that makes South Africa a good agricultural country. For that reason I think the purchase of land must be made with great circumspection.</p>

<heading>JUDGES&#x2019; PENSIONS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-social-welfare">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>This Bill has, in substance, two objectives, namely the payment of gratuities calculated at 6,72% of salaries and allowances to judges or their widows and the calculation of the pensions and gratuities of judges on the basis of their salaries and allowances.</p>
<p>In this regard, the position of judges is now being brought more or less into line with that of members of this House. There is hardly any need for argument with regard to the necessity for this adjustment, but it is nevertheless important for record purposes to point out that judges, like hon. Senators of this House, on accession to office often have to make a considerable sacrifice on being appointed to the South African judiciary.</p>
<p>Often a flourishing practice that has been built up with care and efficiency over a long period, has to be bade farewell and in the case of Judges of Appeal in particular, it also entails a transfer or unavoidable travelling between two centres.</p>
<p>Judges normally only retire at the age of 70 and they surely have a claim to being placed in a position that will ensure them a carefree old age. This is the injury time after the 70 years stipulated by the Bible. Mr. President, in regard to the quality of our judiciary and in regard to the respect which our judges enjoy here and abroad, I need hardly repeat what is already general knowledge. It is therefore with much satisfaction that we are able to announce these improved benefits for our judges and I have no doubt that we shall have the support of the entire House for these steps.</p>
<p>The other provisions of the Bill hardly require any further explanation, but I do wish to mention for the information of hon. Senators that the envisaged amendments contained in clause 4(a) have been necessitated by the fact that as it reads at present, the law does not provide for the payment of a pension to the widow of a judge who retired after 1 April 1972 but before 1 January 1978 and who died after that date. This short-coming is now being rectified, because it was never the intention to exclude such widows from a pension.</p>
<p>In conclusion I just wish to mention for the information of hon. Senators that after reconsideration it has been decided not to require contributions from judges. The position has already been rectified in the Other Place. An amendment to make possible the payment of a gratuity in the estate of a woman judge will also be affected. I shall move this amendment today. I have received representations in this regard which in my opinion are founded on good arguments.</p>
<p>The Bill enjoys the support of my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Justice as well as of the judiciary, and I think any further questions in this regard can profitably be dealt with at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>There are just two matters I want to raise, Mr. President. The first is a rectification in clause 1. I may be wrong but I think the words &#x201C;except for the purposes of section 4B(1)&#x201D; should be omitted.</p>
<p>Secondly, the marginal note next to clause 5 seems to be wrong. Perhaps these matters can be rectified administratively. The proposed section 4B has already been deleted in the Other Place. For the rest I just want to say that the legislation has the approval of this side of the House. I merely wanted to draw attention to these two small matters. It is a pleasure to tender our support for this legislation.</p>

My experience of the few retired judges and the serving judges I know, has been that when they are on the Bench they concentrate on their work to such a degree that it causes an enormous amount of tension. They never think of the future as far as money matters are concerned. I think it is a fine gesture and absolutely justified that we should show appreciation of the wonderful work they do in South Africa, so that, as the hon. the Minister has said, they will have no problems in their old age. With these few words I should like to give my support to this Bill.</p>

<p>This side of the House welcomes the deletion of the provision concerning the contributions which judges had to make to the gratuity fund.</p>
<p>In the third place I am particularly pleased at the concession granted to the widows of judges who the before reaching a certain age. Hon. Senators will remember that the position of the widows of deceased ex-judges was previously considered by pension committees of both Houses of Parliament with a view to financial assistance. Each case was dealt with on merit and an award was made to them accordingly. We are particularly pleased about this new provision and I am sure that the few widows who are affected by this will also be very pleased. We welcome the concession which this legislation makes in this connection.</p>

<p>I should like to thank hon. Senators for their support. I do not think the Bill calls for any further discussion; I think it is fairly clear and it is framed in simple language.

<heading>SEA FISHERIES AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-economic-affairs">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Two considerations form the basis of the Bill that is now before the House firstly, that last year when the Sea Fisheries Development Bill was considered by this House I informed hon. Senators that this year I would be obliged to ask the House to consider certain amendments to the Sea Fisheries Act, mainly to ensure that those persons who contravened the provisions of the Act which protected our fish resources against illegal exploitation would in all cases be apprehended and properly punished; and secondly, to improve certain provisions. of the Act that had become out-dated with a view to carrying on with the consolidation of the principal Act and its amending Acts.</p>
<p>Against this background, therefore, in order to elucidate the proposed legislation, I want to explain the various clauses as follows: <i>Clauses replacing obsolete pro</i> <i>visions of the existing Act or providing for changed circumstances or improved definitions of certain provisions:</i> Clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 14 are involved in this regard. These clauses mainly contain improvements to the wording of certain definitions and other specific provisions of the Act, without essentially changing the existing principles in the Act.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the definition of &#x201C;advisory council&#x201D; be amended and that the definitions of &#x201C;territory&#x201D; and &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; be deleted consequential upon the amendment of section 2 of the Act, which I shall presently explain.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that the definition of &#x201C;factory&#x201D; be amended to exclude &#x201C;fish shop&#x201D; and &#x201C;supermarket&#x201D;. Fish shops and supermarkets are undertaking more and more functions, such as the filleting and packing of fish for their retail clients, and if they were not excluded, it would mean that these concerns would strictly speaking be forced to apply in terms of the Act to be registered as factories so as to be able to undertake the processing of the fish to which I have referred. Since it is obviously not the intention that these concerns should have to be licensed in this way, this amendment is being proposed.</p>
<p>Since the S.A. Railways is the largest goods carrier in the country, and since goods traffic in the commercial ports and at airports are also under the control of the Railways, the Railway Police could do much, in co-operation with the Department of Industries, to bring to light, for example, the transport of the products of frozen lobster which have been caught illegally, if the powers of fisheries inspectors under the Sea Fisheries Act, 1973, were to be extended to such officers, as in the case of the S.A. Police. In a recent case, for example, it came to light that 1 400 kg of frozen lobster tails which had been caught and packed illegally had been transported as pet food from Cape Town to Johannesburg with a view to their resale after they had been repacked for human consumption. By the insertion of the definition of &#x201C;police officer&#x201D; so as to include Railway Police officers as well, the powers conferred upon fisheries inspectors in terms of section 6 of the Act are extended to Railway Police officers.</p>
<p>One of the basic principles of the Act, which is aimed at protecting the fishing resources along the coast of the RSA, is that all vessels catching fish for commercial purposes are compelled to have their vessels licensed as fishing boats in terms of the Act The department and I myself were under the impression that the present provisions of the Act also imposed this obligation on all persons other than <i>bona fide</i> fishermen who occasionally caught and sold fish, but during a recent prosecution in this connection, the court ruled that the present provisions of the Act could not be interpreted as compelling part-time fishermen who sold their catches to have their boats registered as fishing boats.</p>
<p>It is essential for the effective protection and management of our fishing resources to be able to ascertain, through the obligatory submission of catch statistics by the captains of licensed fishing boats, what assaults are in fact being made on these resources, and for this reason, it is proposed that the definition of &#x201C;fisherman&#x201D; and &#x201C;fishing boat&#x201D; be amended as proposed so as to put it beyond all doubt that all boats which are used for catching fish for sale on a full-time or a part-time basis must be licensed as fishing boats in terms of the Act.</p>
<p>The present definition of &#x201C;seaweed&#x201D; is being deleted, while it is proposed that it be replaced by a definition of &#x201C;aquatic plants&#x201D;, which will mean that seaweed and all other algae and plants will be protected by the provisions of the Act.</p>
<p>Under section 2 of the Act, the Minister is authorized to appoint fisheries advisory councils for the Republic and South West Africa respectively. In view of the constitutional development which is envisaged for South West Africa and the fact that the Administrator-General has already taken over the administration of the functions of the Department of Industries in South West Africa as far as the fishing industry is concerned, there is no further need for the appointment of such a council in respect of the area by the Minister of Economic Affairs, and it is proposed that section 2 be amended as indicated in clause 2 of the Bill. Consequential amendments to the definition of &#x201C;advisory council&#x201D; and the deletion of the definitions of &#x201C;territory&#x201D; and &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; in section 1 of the Act, to which I have already referred, are therefore also required.</p>
<p>Clause 3 contains a consequential amendment to section 3 of the Act, arising from the proposed amendment to section 8 of the Act.</p>
<p>Clauses 4 and 12 of the Bill propose to substitute for the obsolete references to the former Criminal Procedure Act the number and date of the latest Criminal Procedure Act which repealed the 1955 Act.</p>
<p>Clause 5 contains certain proposed amendments to section 8 in order to draw a distinction between the procedure laid down for the renewal of existing fishing boat licences and for new applications for licences. The amendment is intended to simplify the procedure of application in the case of the annual renewal of licences of existing fishing boats, the circumstances of which have not changed, as against applications in respect of boats which have not been licensed before and in respect of which a comprehensive application form requiring full particulars must be submitted for record purposes.</p>
<p>Clause 6 seeks to amend section 10(1)(a) of the Act and is required for technical reasons. The present wording of the Act requires that specific years should be identified in the notice and that a prohibition cannot for example be imposed on the catching or disturbing of fish for an indefinite period&#x2014;specified in years. The proposed amendment will remove this problem.</p>
<p>Clause 9 seeks to amend section 13 of the Act in order to extend the Minister&#x2019;s power to make regulations under the Act in cases where they are inadequate for the achievement of certain aims with regard to the catching of fish and the use of equipment.</p>
<p>Clause 14 contains an amendment which is consequential upon the proposed deletion of the definition of &#x201C;seaweed&#x201D;, and clause 15 contains the short title.</p>
<p>†I should like now to refer to those clauses which contain new principles. In four instances the insertion of new principles into the present Act is proposed, namely in clauses 7, 8, 10 and 13.</p>
<p>In the first instance the Minister&#x2019;s present powers to control fishing and the receipt and processing of fish by licensed fishing boats and factories in terms of section 11 are redefined in some respects in terms of clause 7. This amendment will remove all doubt as to the Minister&#x2019;s authority to withdraw or reduce the catching or processing rights of any authorized fisherman or factory that fails to adhere to the provisions of his licence or permit or who is convicted in terms of the Act. Due to the high prices realized on the local and overseas market for certain fish and fish products it has been found that certain quota-holders who in fact enjoy exclusive rights for the exploitation of our fishing resources cannot resist the temptation to take more than their quota and to disregard the restrictive provisions pertaining to their rights.</p>
<p>In terms of clause 8 the Minister is empowered to regulate the collecting of water plants (mainly seaweed) or shells by way of regulation while the provisions of clause 10 will enable the Minister to exercise his existing powers to obtain statistical information in terms of section 14 by way of endorsements to this end on permits or by means of requests to licenceholders.</p>
<p>In terms of clause 13 the Minister&#x2019;s existing power to grant exemptions from the provisions of the Act to persons engaged in scientific work will be extended by permitting him to grant such exemptions subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I should like to refer to the fact that I have already decided to appoint a parliamentary commission of inquiry with the terms of reference as I have indicated before. *In this specific connection it appears to me that before we can come forward with a completely revised Sea Fisheries Act, we should rather have an authoritative report in terms of the instruction of the parliamentary committee. I trust that the committee will be able to complete its task so that when we meet again, we shall be able to introduce a consolidating or substitute Bill for consideration.</p>
<p>In conclusion it may be of interest to hon. Senators to learn that South Africa has been a member of the International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by the Dumping of Refuse and Other Substances into the Sea since 7 August 1978. In terms of the provisions of this convention, South Africa as a member country is obliged to pass legislation for this country so as to be able to exercise control over the dumping of refuse into the sea. Although it is possible to a limited extent to control the dumping of refuse and other substances by way of regulation under the Sea Fisheries Act, the aspects to be controlled in terms of the convention cover a much wider field, and consequently I intend to submit a Bill to Parliament for its consideration as soon as possible so as to be able to exercise control over this important matter in accordance with international practice.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister has given us a lengthy exposition of the need for the legislation before us and has indicated that many of the amendments are there to improve the text and to tighten up the provisions so that transgressors will be brought into the net. It is necessary that we have legislation which is effective and on that score we support the amendments that have been proposed.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that we have to conserve our resources as much as possible. We have to see that they are not fished out, that our resources are not depleted. Some time ago, in this House and in the Other Place, we endorsed the extension of our territorial waters so as to provide for fishing limits and so to conserve our resources. That being so, I was pleased to see that the legislation before us had an unanimous support of all the parties in the Other Place. I take it that the hon. the Minister had the wholehearted support of his whole caucus. That being so, I am going to ask him to talk to his party&#x2019;s candidate for the South Coast provincial seat because this gentleman has attacked the ban that has been imposed on the catching of shad. He has said that this is a principle that is going to be an issue at that election. But the principle before us is the control of all fishing.</p>
<p>As we know, the Smith Commission which was appointed by the Province of Natal, recommended that the shad ban should be continued. They endorsed the action taken there for the conservation of this particular type of fish. This particular Act before us gives the hon. the Minister the power to control all fishing, whether from boats or from the shore. We are not opposing that. We think that in the interests of conservation this is necessary. We are surprised therefore that a member of his own party is now attacking the Government of the Province of Natal. I think I must ask the hon. the Minister to go and wave a stick at him. I want to challenge the hon. the Minister either to repudiate his candidate or to withdraw the provisions of clause 7.</p>

<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Sir, the licensing of fishing is the burning issue now and not to put the ban on the catching of a few shad.</p>
<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to confirm my reading of the provisions of the Bill before us, and that is that if any fish is sold the boats will have to be licensed; even if a person goes out in a rowing boat once a year and then sells some fish, he must be licensed. It is quite clear that this is a control measure and that it is a conservation measure, and one which we should support. Certain complaints that have been made about penalties and confiscations etc., are inapt because it is the courts that confiscate and not the Government. Therefore I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to take note of that.</p>
<p>I want now to refer further to clause 7 of the Bill before us. Whilst I am wholeheartedly in support of the legislation on conservation, we find that there is something of a anomaly here. Whilst most of us are free traders and we back the free enterprise system, there are times when we have to knuckle down to the needs of our country and the needs to conserve our resources. That being so, we have previously accepted in principle&#x2014;and we again accept it&#x2014;the question of the imposition of quotas. This we have to accept as it is necessary. It is a conservation measure. The difficulty we come across in this respect, is that whilst the quotas for the catching particularly of hake are not being increased&#x2014;in fact, they may be reduced and I think the same thing goes for lobsters, etc.&#x2014;the number of quota-holders appears to be increasing. In other words, we are getting more people catching a lesser quantity of fish. The quota overall is therefore less but the number of people catching fish is greater. Therefore the catch per boat is less.</p>
<p>I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that as a result of rising costs and as a result of the oil price increase alone, we are likely to have an increase of up to 15% in the price of our locally sold fish. Obviously the overseas price is fixed by the market in those countries. The cost of the replacement of trawlers is anything up to R8 million per trawler. These trawlers today are not working to capacity. In fact they are working very much below capacity so their productivity is much less and so we realize that there is a very great danger of prices continuing to increase. I want therefore to appeal once more to the hon. the Minister to make sure when applications are made for new quotas that he looks at these very carefully indeed to see whether, in fact, because of his keenness to be a free trader he does not yield to that without considering the impact on the other quotaholders whom he has already licensed. If he does not do so it may well be that in the interests of encouraging competition he will in fact be doing exactly the opposite by increasing the price to the consumer.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I rise on behalf of this side of the House to express our thanks and appreciation for the introduction of this Bill. Fish is a foodstuff with the highest protein content and always has been and always will be a very important part of our food supply. We are worried, however, that fish-stealing is increasing to such an extent that we are in danger of having our fish supplies restricted. That is why we appreciate this legislation to promote protection. We also welcome the commission of inquiry. I find it strange that not a single Senator has been appointed to that commission though. Those of us from the interior do not expect to be appointed, but as I feel that the object of that commission is not only to expand the fishing industry but to maintain it as one of our most important industries, I would like to see attention being given in future to our fresh-water fish. I think there is a tremendous potential in this connection. There are 170 000 million cubic metres of water stored in the interior.</p>
<p>For those reasons we on this side of the House heartily support this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I was very impressed by the point made by the hon. Senator Bozas. I noticed that whilst he was making it, the hon. the Minister shook his head as if to negative one thing that had been said.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the point made was that there is a fixed quota for various types of fish including hake, i.e. stockfish. The point the hon. Senator Bozas was making. was that although there is a fixed quota, more permits are being issued for the catching of hake. This means that the existing companies that catch hake now have a reduced share of that quota.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Then I simply want to say that if one believes in the free enterprise system, as we do, one must obviously carry it out and must not impose quotas. But if one believes in conservation, as we also do, in regard to fish, then one must impose quotas. But then one cannot have the free enterprise system operating within that ceiling. One cannot do that. One has then to follow the principle to its logical conclusion and not issue any more permits for new quotas. That was the point the hon. Senator Bozas made and I was concerned because the hon. the Minister was shaking his head. I should be very glad to have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s view in this regard.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-economic-affairs">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we do not differ very much here. I want to explain at once that there are various forms of control of utilization rights. It is a question of quotas. Many of the quotas are issued on an individual basis; others again are on a total basis. What happens is that in respect of white fish which was in effect a total quota, we issued individual quotas. We experienced a practical problem, viz. that in granting a total quota, a greater capacity to catch was created than the total resource could carry. One person who has a large catching capacity will catch the whole quota before another person has started catching. We decided to divide the total quota among the various catchers who previously had a quota. As a result of this each one has an individual quota and he can adjust his catching capacity according to his quota. I want to explain that we do have sympathy with the attitude which hon. Senators have adopted in this connection.</p>
<p>Sir, as is the case with everything one does not have to work for&#x2014;and fish quotas are something people have not had to work for&#x2014;there is always difficulty. We came to the conclusion that we had again to look in depth at the whole fishing industry. This must be done with a view to this very problem, as well as to the others which hon. Senators have referred to.</p>
<p>†Let me say, Mr. President, that in view of the problem of trying to ascertain the sensitive balance between conservation and exploitation I have decided to appoint a parliamentary commission with specific terms of reference that affect the utilization of the resources. It may be a good idea if, for the sake of the record, I refer to these terms of reference. From that hon. Senators will be able to assess the urgency with which I view the problems to which the hon. Senator Bozas has referred.</p>
<p>The terms of reference are as follows. Firstly, the present basis and method of granting utilization rights&#x2014;this could be in the form of a licence or a quota&#x2014;and the question whether such basis and method as well as the systems employed by the concessionaries&#x2014;the holders of those quotas or licences&#x2014;in the marketing of the products best serve the public interest.</p>
<p>Secondly, the principles applied in the past in connection with the granting of utilization rights and, in the case of rock lobster, in connection with marketing rights, the applicability of those principles in present circumstances and the question whether the accepted principles have been adhered to consistently.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the principles which should be applied in connection with the granting of utilization rights to persons or firms. This is the question to which hon. Senators have referred.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the desirability of restricting the period of validity of utilization rights considering the investment concessionaries have to make for the optimal utilization of the marine resources.</p>
<p>Fifthly, the recognition to be accorded to persons and firms which have already obtained these rights and the manner in which the justifiable claims of others should be taken into consideration. Hon. Senators will understand that we have an inheritance which in fact means only one thing, i.e. that these utilization rights are held in a number of hands. There is virtually no possibility of any others entering this particular field unless they buy the concessions from the concessionaries who hold these rights at the moment. I think hon. Senators will agree that it is only fair to reassess the position in order to see whether this system is still operating effectively and fairly.</p>
<p>Sixthly, the possibilities and desirability of charging fees in the granting of rights or for the exercise of rights for the purpose of financing Government functions in connection with the control of the utilization of these resources. Let me explain this again. Without trying to anticipate the findings of the commission, the question does arise as to whether we should not&#x2014;like other coun-ies&#x2014;treat sea-fishing as farming. Any farmer has to acquire his land; he has to fertilize his land. However, in regard to the products of the sea the position in South Africa is completely different. Therefore one has to consider whether the system that applies today is still the most effective one in regard to the two things we want to do, i.e. to conserve and to utilize.</p>
<p>The last term of reference is the application of conditions aimed at protecting the South African consumer interest with the least possible adverse effect on the country&#x2019;s export earnings from resources concerned.</p>
<p>I trust that in having said this, I have satisfied hon. Senators that we are looking very carefully into the problems they have raised. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>In regard to shad fishing in Natal I should like to say the following. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>*Mr. President, I want to say immediately that we should never afford hon. Senators the opportunity to fish on dry ground; particularly not during elections. As is the case with the catching of other types of fish in Natal, the catching of shad creates a tremendous number of problems. These problems relate to the different control authorities which one finds in Natal. There is, for instance, the Division of Sea Fisheries of my Department of Industries which has control over boat catches in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1973. However, there are also the powers delegated to the Province of Natal and to the Parks Board. The hon. Senator is aware of this. Because there are different points of view, someone has to act as an arbitrator. Consultations have taken place between my Department, the Natal Administration and the Parks Board which controls the catching of fish from the beach One can advance very strong arguments in regard to whether one has the most effective control by so much divided control. This, however, is also a matter which is being investigated and a matter concerning which I shall be receiving a report. I shall then put my point of view.</p>

<p>I should also like to thank the hon. Senator Groenewald for his contribution. It is extremely important that we should realize that most countries in the world have destroyed their fishing resources. For that reason there has been an over-exploitation of our own resources to a large extent and we have had to extend our territorial waters in order to obtain effective control of our own efforts and also those of other countries in our waters.

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The history of higher education in the Eastern Cape goes back as far as 1855 when St. Andrews College was founded at Grahamstown. It offered both junior and advanced courses and prepared students for degree examinations. St. Andrews established a separate college department in 1878, more than 100 years ago, from which was formed the present-day Rhodes University.</p>
<p>Rhodes University College was founded by an Act of Parliament on 31 May 1904, and became a constituent college of the University of South Africa in 1918.</p>
<p>The Rhodes University Act by which the new university was to be constituted was signed by the Governor-General and assented to on 5 April 1949. It is an amendment to that Act that is being proposed in the Bill now before the House.</p>
<p>Rhodes University has continued to grow and to keep abreast of university developments in general while remaining one of the important custodians of the English-language-based culture through its relationship to the Eastern Cape and the historical settler town of Grahamstown.</p>
<p>Many important research institutes have been established at Rhodes University, including the Tick Research Unit which is supported by the CSIR, the Rhodes Institute for Fresh Water Studies and the J. L. B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology. The university holds an advantageous position for the establishment of a Faculty of Veterinary Science as well as for offering courses in fishery science, provided the necessary financial assistance can be given.</p>
<p>Following an amendment to the Rhodes University Act in 1960, a division of Rhodes University was formally opened at Port Elizabeth on 24 February 1961 which eventually led to the establishment of the independent University of Port Elizabeth in 1965.</p>
<p>As a result of extensive requests to establish university facilities at East London, a survey of East London&#x2019;s tertiary educational needs was conducted which enabled an authoritative submission to be made by Rhodes University to the Minister of National Education for the extension of university facilities to East London.</p>
<p>This request has received the sympathetic consideration of the Department of National Education and, in order to pave the way for this development, Rhodes University was requested to give attention to the necessary amendments to its Act.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the present Bill before the House is to empower the university to conduct its university activities also in the municipal area and in the magisterial district of East London.</p>
<p>Provision is made furthermore at the request of the student body for the establishment of the Students&#x2019; Representative Council as a statutory body, as well as for the election of this council, for its composition and for ancillary matters relating thereto.</p>
<p>The remaining provisions of the Bill are aimed at facilitating and improving the general administration of the affairs of the university. Senator P. J. SWANEPOEL: Mr. President, on behalf of the official Opposition it gives me great pleasure to support this Bill. The hon. Senator who has introduced these amendments to the original Act has, I think, given us a satisfactory explanation of why these amendments are necessary, namely, to extend the activities of Rhodes University to the magisterial district and the municipal area of East London. This sort of move is always welcomed by us because we believe that wherever the light of knowledge can be spread, and wherever facilities can be made available for further study, this should be supported wholeheartedly. South Africa is so much in need of more facilities for education that at no time would we dare to oppose a measure of this nature. It therefore gives us great pleasure to support this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#dempsey">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. C. DEMPSEY</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I rise merely to express the support of this side of the House for the proposed Bill The erection of a new university in the times in which we live is a gigantic undertaking, both in regard to capital and human endeavour. Capital-wise, literally millions of rands are involved and, as far as the academic staff is concerned, it is a simple fact that great problems arise in obtaining the necessary staff for a new university. We have already had instances in this country where existing universities have established branches in other towns. The hon. Senator who introduced the Bill referred to the branch of Rhodes University which was previously situate at Port Elizabeth, and which led to the establishment of a full-fledged university there. I can also mention the case of the University of Stellenbosch which is presently developing a branch or campus at Durbanville, and I can foresee that in the years to come this too will probably develop into an independent university. I think a town like East London has little hope of having its own university in the near future for the reasons I have mentioned; for instance, the fact that large capital sums are involved, and also that the human material is not always readily available.</p>
<p>Through this Bill university education will now be brought within the reach of East London, and that is something we all welcome. It gives the people of East London the opportunity to get their university education at home, so that they need not travel great distances to attend universities which in any case have more than sufficient students. This is an advantage which the people of East London will appreciate and I sincerely hope that they will make use of it on a large scale.</p>
<p>The establishment of a branch at East London might form the nucleus of what lies ahead in the years to come&#x2014;probably many many years to come, when we are no longer here; in any case this Senate will definitely no longer exist&#x2014;when a full-fledged university can develop. It is in that light especially that I view this matter this afternoon. In the short-term they are getting those facilities now, but in the longterm too it might well mean that one day they will have their own full-fledged university at East London, something we shall obviously welcome in the long run.</p>
<p>I need not refer to the other matters. These are domestic changes; they concern changes in the student council and also the senate and council of the university. We have no comment to make in this regard and it is actually only the one section 1 have mentioned that requires attention this afternoon. We on this side of the House heartily support the Bill that has been introduced by the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell for the reasons I have given.</p>

<p>Ex-Senator Worrall was, I think, a professor at Rhodes University, but I do not know whether he was a student there. Nevertheless, I want to say that it is only right that that university, which I started at 34 years ago when there were less than 2 000 students there, has now grown to a size where it has not only become a substantive university, having graduated from being a college of the University of South Africa, but is now also looking to other parts of the Eastern Cape. In the Eastern Cape, Grahamstown has become a sort of nucleus for education for the English-speaking people of that region. Grahamstown schools have for many years formed the nucleus of the educational system in that region, and Rhodes University, with its connections in Port Elizabeth and East London and other parts of the Eastern Cape is the natural catchment area&#x2014;if I might call it that&#x2014;for English-medium education at university level. I think this is a great step forward for this Parliament to enact this legislation to establish a further satellite college in East London. I think it is a natural consequence and I think this is a very good step we are taking.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation of the measure of support accorded this Bill in the speeches of the hon. Senators Swanepoel, Dempsey and Poorter. At the same time I should like to place on record the deep appreciation of the University of Rhodes as well as the people of East London for the important role played by Mr. R. de V. Olckers, M.P., who introduced this Bill in the Other Place. There can be little doubt, Sir, that the extension of university facilities to the city of East London will bring the University of Rhodes increased status as well as further opportunity to extend its activities in the field of tertiary education, whilst at the same time creating a fresh inspiration for the people of East London that the future of that part of South Africa is sound and lies essentially in the degree of determination, courage and relentless pursuance of ideals that the people of the Border exhibit to the problems and challenges of their area.</p>
<p>This Bill which is the first step towards achieving the ideal of extending tertiary education to East London is, in my opinion, of such great importance in the creation of a healthy climate for growth, prosperity and continuity in East London, that I would appeal to the Government and to private enterprise to make every possible financial contribution towards the establishment of university facilities in East London. I also want to express my faith in the university and the people of East London in the hope that this step will lead to something that will be a source of pride for future generations.</p>

<heading>AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>Bill read a First Time.</p>
<p><i>Second Reading</i></p>
<speech by="#minister-of-agriculture">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move subject to Standing Order No. 56&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The proposed amendment to section 2 of the principal Act seeks to reduce by three the membership of the Agricultural Credit Board, as established under the Act. The Act initially provided for a board consisting of 10 members. In 1970, the Act was made applicable to South West Africa as well. At that stage, provision was made for a membership of 12, so that a committee of the board, consisting of three members, could be appointed for the territory. In view of the new dispensation for South West Africa, the Administrator-General appointed a full-fledged board for the territory as from 1 August 1978. The membership of the Agricultural Credit Board, the functions of which are limited to the Republic, can now therefore be reduced to nine. This number will afford adequate representation to both the agricultural departments concerned and the farming sector.</p>
<p>Secondly, provision is made for special terms and conditions where the board assists a farmer who is less well-endowed with capital by leasing State land to him with an option to buy. Under the existing provisions of the Act, the board may sell or lease State land to a farmer or prospective farmer which in the opinion of the board is suitable for farming purposes. Interest is payable at a rate of 5% per annum in respect of such assistance, in terms of the provisions of the Act, and where such land is leased, an annual rental of 5% a year of the economic agricultural value of the property concerned is charged. This means that when undeveloped agricultural land has hitherto been allocated in terms of the existing provisions under a lease or a deed of sale, the farmer has had to possess sufficient funds of his own not only to develop the farming unit effectively but also to meet the capital and interest or rental obligations. When a farmer did not have such capital funds and could not afford either to pay rent at an economic rate right from the start, he could therefore not be helped under the Act to acquire such agricultural land. The proposed addition in section 10 will remedy this deficiency. In essence, it means that it will be possible to lease agricultural land to a farmer for a period of five years, but not exceeding 10 years, with the option to purchase, and that more favourable lease conditions than the present ones will apply. For the first two years of the lease, no rental will be payable. For the third and fourth years, the rental will be 2% of the purchase price, and for the fifth year and any further period by which the lease may be extended, the annual rental will be 5% of the purchase price. This will be of particular assistance to the farmer who is just beginning, to establish himself.</p>
<p>†Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the deletion of paragraph (a) of section 35(1) of the principal Act. Section 35 of the Act relates to the registration of a number of special conditions or restrictions against the title deeds of immovable property when assistance is rendered against security of a mortgage bond. One of the said restrictions provides that the property may not be subdivided without the consent of the Minister of Agriculture. Since 1970 control over the subdivision of agricultural land has been exercised in terms of the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act, 1970. Endorsements in terms of section 35(1)(a) of the Agricultural Credit Act are therefore no longer required. This also explains why provision is made in clause 5 for the suspension of such an existing title condition prohibiting the subdivision of agricultural land without the consent of the Minister of Agriculture and the removal of restrictions imposed in terms of the said section 35(1)(a).</p>
<p>Section 37 of the principal Act makes provision for the attachment and sale in execution by the Minister of immovable property which has been mortgaged in favour of the State, in order to recover outstanding amounts in respect of assistance granted. Furthermore, the Minister is empowered to purchase such property out of moneys appropriated by Parliament. This is being done to ensure that the mortgaged property is not sold for less than the economic valuation as the proceeds thereof will not be sufficient to cover the claim of the State. However, no provision is made for such purchase by the State as mortgagee when such property is sold by another creditor by virtue of a judgment or in terms of the Land Bank Act The object of clause 4 is to cover such a situation.</p>

I think the spirit that the hon. Senator has revealed today reflects his gratitude as a dairy farmer for the dairy produce prices that have been announced.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I like the remarks made by the hon. the Minister and I want to remind him of the fact that I am first and foremost a producer of red meat and not a dairy farmer. I know I was nominated to serve on the Dairy Board as the representative of the Transvaal Agricultural Union but the hon. the Minister must not feel too badly about not having appointed me. I understand his problems.</p>
<p>The board is now being reduced from 12 to 9 members and instead of having two officials as in the past there will only be one in future. As far as this is concerned, I want to put in a good word for the Public Service. Sir, those people know what they are doing, in spite of all the other people who are appointed over their heads. We as a farming community get very good advice from those officials and I just want to say that I personally am sorry&#x2014; and I think the farming community will agree with me&#x2014;that only one of those officials will be available to us. We do not want to flatter the Public Service but those Government officials are the people who know what is in fact happening in that department. The other members are appointed because of their knowledge of agricultural techniques, agricultural economies or farming, and I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to retain those two officials. Those people are of inestimable value to the farming community; we can go to them with our problems, we can discuss those problems with them and I think it would be wise to retain those two officials, in spite of the fact that the board is being made smaller.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I have explained, this is a reduction as a result of the fact that South West Africa now has its own Agricultural Credit Board. Consequently the number has been reduced from 12 to 9. I appreciate what the hon. Senator has said about the officials. But even if the number of officials is reduced by one to meet the position in South West Africa, the hon. Senator will still get the same service. It is not necessary for that person to serve on the board. As in the past, the hon. Senator can still get the same advice from the department because we have experts there. I do not think, therefore, that it will create any problems. The South African Agricultural Union has also agreed that the number be reduced because of the secession of South West Africa. I have noted what he has said and the hon. Senator can rest assured that we at Agricultural Credit and all the other officials will still, as in the past, give him advice.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-agriculture">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move subject to Standing Order No. 56&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>From time to time the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure receives representations from people who claim ownership to land to which they have no title deeds owing to the failure in the past on the part of heirs and other people who were entitled thereto, to obtain transfer of ownership of immovable property. Accordingly, the representations are to the effect that the authorities should take steps to provide the interested parties with title deeds in respect of their rights.</p>
<p>In the past, every such case was dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and where the State considered such a step justified, it acted by establishing machinery by legislation to bring such a matter to a satisfactory conclusion. In the cases dealt with in this way up to now, this was done after it had become clear that owing to circumstances, the normal procedure of applying to a court to regulate the matter, did not afford a practical solution because it was not found possible to obtain the co operation of all the interested parties. In the cases where the State acted there was, in fact, not even clarity or conclusive proof of who had claims.</p>
<p>In those cases where the State acted, this took place on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, as already indicated, and in every case a separate hybrid Bill was piloted through Parliament. The pattern, apart from the use of the procedure of hybrid legislation, amounted in every case to the establishment of a body with authority to obtain evidence in accordance with a procedure laid down in the Act, in terms of which the identity of interested parties and the nature and extent of their interest in the property could be ascertained, and so as to assess the interest of each such interested party.</p>
<p>More and more cases are occurring where the State is requested to assist groups of people in the manner described, cases where action by the State is in fact both desirable and justified. To mention only the most important aspects of the unsatisfactory position that normally exists: Where owners have any claim to ownership in a specific locality, in the absence of title deeds, they are unable to obtain any credit for these development of their properties by using the property in question as security. The result is the neglect and deterioration of the property and needless poverty among many of the interested parties. The worst of it is that with the passage of time, as interested parties die and further heirs without title deeds come forward, the position is aggravated and it becomes more and more difficult to rectify.</p>
<p>It is a needlessly tiresome and expensive process to introduce separate legislation in every case, and what we have before us now is a general measure in terms of which it is hoped future cases can be dealt with. I probably need not explain in great detail, but hon. Senators will note from the text of the Bill that in the procedures prescribed we are going to great lengths to ensure that the interests of claimants are thoroughly investigated and then adjudicated upon.</p>
<p>†In the first place provision has been made for the publication in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and in a newspaper circulating in the area of notices drawing the attention to a proposed designation of a property in terms of the Act. If objections are received against such a designation the matter will be referred to a select committee for consideration and further steps will only be taken after the approval, by resolution, of both Houses of Parliament has been granted in respect of such designation.</p>
<p>The Bill provides for the establishment of land division committees consisting of three members with the power to determine which persons are entitled to be registered as owners of the land in question. The first task of a land division committee will be to determine who the lawful owners of the property are. To this end a land division committee must publish a notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and in a local newspaper requesting persons who claim to have a right to the land concerned to submit their applications within a period of two months from the date of publication. The interests of persons who are subject to some form of legal disability must also be borne in mind even though such a person does not apply according to the provisions.</p>
<p>Ample provision has been made for the recording of objections to any allocation made by the committee and an applicant can also ask a committee to reconsider a specific allocation if he is not satisfied with the findings of that committee. Special provision has been made for the submission and hearing of evidence. The final ruling of a committee will, however, be conclusive and for the purposes of transfer to the lawful owners the committee will be regarded as being the owner.</p>
<p>All expenses a committee shall incur in connection with the allocation and transfer of land will be paid from funds voted by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, but in fact on a recoverable basis. In other words, each claimant will have to pay his rightful share of the costs incurred to the said department for payment into the State Revenue Fund. Transfer will not take place before the costs have been paid or satisfactory arrangements for their payment have been made.</p>
<p>*In conclusion, I might just mention again that the main object of the legislation is to establish measures whereby a body can be instituted in the particular circumstances to which I referred initially to institute investigations into, and to adjudicate upon, the claims of persons to be registered as owners of land and to give transfer to the rightful claimants.</p>
<p>Mr. President, may I just say by way of elucidation that hon. Senators who were here at the time when I was Deputy Minister will probably remember that legislation was piloted through this hon. House in connection with Schoemanshoek. There was a family complex of a few thousand morgen. The family had farmed there from one generation to another and the land had been subdivided. The families concerned became larger and larger, newcomers came and settled there, but nobody had a deed of transfer registered in his name. The Bill that was passed at the time by both the Other Place and this hon. House was a hybrid Bill. It contained all sorts of cumbersome details and afforded all interested parties an opportunity of stating their case. For years these people were unable to have deeds of transfer registered in their names so that they could approach a bank for a loan in order to develop their land and tender their deed of transfer as security. Mr. President, when the Bill was eventually passed and consensus reached by all those who farmed at Schoemanshoek it was agreed, in accordance with the arrangements that I have just suggested, that everyone would get his deed of transfer after one generation after the other had not been able to obtain it. On the day when the deeds of transfer were handed to the respective owners some old ladies were so overcome that they had tears in their eyes and said: &#x201C;Now at last, after all these years, our children are the owners of their own property.&#x201D; The same thing happened in the George area and a similar case in the Rustenburg district has just come to our notice. Various cases of this nature have a historical origin and the whole purpose of this Bill is to afford that section of the farming community an opportunity of solving the problem. I think, therefore, that this is positive legislation and I think it will be supported in all quarters because in actual fact I am introducing this legislation for the sake of the people on the platteland.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I am grateful to the hon. the Minister for the second explanation he has given us since having introduced the Bill. I remember the case to which he has referred. As the hon. the Minister has said, he was still a Deputy Minister when he introduced that legislation. If I remember correctly, I said at the time that it would create an extremely difficult situation. As a matter of fact it is a really thorny question particularly where it is the duty of a committee to make decisions as indicated in this legislation.</p>
<p>Having read the legislation a few times I wonder whether this problem will not be solved if those concerned, for example, those people at Schoemanshoek who are all family members, form a company so that the company can take transfer of the land on behalf of those entitled to possession? Perhaps that will be an easier and more practical way of solving this problem. Because to subdivide the land and give transfer to each one, especially in view of the uneconomic units we already have in South Africa today, could lead to many problems. Would it not be better if the people concerned, in a case such as this, formed a company that could take transfer on their behalf? I make this suggestion without taking it any further. Neither does that mean that we are opposing the legislation on those grounds. We support it but perhaps attention could be given to this one aspect, namely whether that does not perhaps offer a solution.</p>

<p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House support the legislation. I do not want to react to the suggestion made by the hon. Senator Oelrich because it is not in a form of a motion before this House. However, on behalf of this side of the House I want to express our sincere gratitude to the hon. the Minister for the fact that by means of this legislation he is taking a positive step in order to try to solve the problems of those people who do not have title deeds. I believe the people in Langkloof and possibly at Clanwilliam as well are still having problems. Because people do not have title to the land on which they are living, they cannot borrow the necessary capital to develop their land. As far as I am concerned, therefore, this is a step forward and we support the legislation wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister knows that we who come from Charles Herman Bosman&#x2019;s part of the world are experiencing serious problems. I do not like moneylenders and their ilk because we farmers are already so deeply in debt that we cannot borrow any more money. However, the farmers in my area are experiencing a real problem as regards the application of the Soil Conservation Act. Therefore I support this legislation wholeheartedly. The farmers in the Marico district are very progressive farmers. The only subsidy that we as farmers regard as justified is a subsidy for soil conservation. But the problem is that unless a person is the registered owner of the land he cannot get assistance to improve that land. I do not support the other appeals for credit and so forth that have been made because the farmers cannot afford further credit I do think, however, that this legislation is a practical step to implement the provisions of the Soil Conservation Act which is a good old SAP law and consequently I welcome it.</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we have before us this afternoon, a Bill which follows the pattern of much legislation coming from the Nationalist Party. Over the years in which I have served this Parliament a number of Bills have been introduced to deal with specific instances. But this afternoon we have an omnibus Bill in terms of which the hon. the Minister is asking for approval, for the future, not to have to come to Parliament in every instance where there is a question of disposing of land in respect of which there is communal ownership. He asks for the administrative right to appoint committees in terms of an empowering Act which will have much the same provisions as have been contained in the legislation which is now before us. Let me hasten to add that as such we welcome this Bill which will be of administrative help to him. I envisage that we are not in future going to have such Bills as were presented to us in the past. I think particularly of one Bill which arrived on our desks one day in the 1960s headed: &#x201C;The Paarl Mountain Disposal Bill. &#x201D; The question we immediately asked ourselves was: &#x201C;How does Parliament dispose of the Paarl Mountain?&#x201D;</p>
<p>We wondered what precisely was expected of us. Were we supposed to load it on wheelbarrows and cart it away, or what were we precisely to do? Of course, we found when we went into the Bill that it was precisely the same sort of thing as we are being asked to provide for today, but with regard to the rights of grazing and other rights in respect of the Paarl Mountain. Then we had, as the hon. the Minister mentioned, the question of Schoemanshoek. The hon. Senator La Grange mentioned the cases of Langkloof and Clanwilliam as well. The hon. Senator La Grange mentioned that there were still problems in those areas, but I am glad to hear from the hon. the Minister that he has been able to sort out the problems at Schoemanshoek and that everybody there seems to be satisfied. But we do have the situation in other areas where similar provision has been made in legislation for the administration of an area by a committee, and then the ultimate disposal of that area by that committee. In some areas it has not worked as well as it appears to have worked at Schoemanshoek. I want to support the hon. the Senator La Grange when he says that it has not worked so well. I believe there are certain questions which the hon. the Minister should reply to this afternoon before we approve this legislation in its detail. Rather than to waste the time of this Senate at the Committee Stage, I would like to put certain questions to the hon. the Minister now and, provided we get satisfactory answers, we will not waste any time at the Committee Stage.</p>
<p>There is doubt about the way in which some of these places are being administered. The biggest problem appears to be the question of the answerability of the committee concerned. It is alleged that these committees are answerable to no one, that they are laws unto themselves and that they can &#x201C;do their own thing&#x201D;, to put it in the vernacular. It is also said that they do not have to report to anybody. A number of lotholders are unhappy about the treatment they have received, but they do not seem to have any recourse to anybody. It may be that a person is unhappy about the progress which a committee makes. I am now not talking about the ultimate designation of landowners. I know of one instance&#x2014;I will not mention the name here but will give it to the hon. the Minister in confidence&#x2014;where an Act was passed through this Parliament in 1971, and where very little appears to have been done since then. To whom do the people concerned complain if nothing is being done? Questions that I believe the hon. the Minister should answer are these: Does he in fact receive progress reports from these committees? I see no provision in this Bill for any such reports to the hon. the Minister or to his department by these committees. Unless I have misread it, it would appear from the Bill that these committees become wholly autonomous and can &#x201C;do their own thing&#x201D; in their own way. I believe that if my interpretation of the Bill is correct, this is a shortcoming which the hon. the Minister will have to look at and will have to put right. I believe he has to place some brake on the activities of these committees and also some spur behind them &#x2014;to get them moving&#x2014;to make them get on with the job that they have been given. I believe the best way to do this is to make them report to the hon. the Minister so that he and his department can see that they are doing their jobs. Flowing from this is of course the question of his satisfaction with the progress that has been made.</p>
<p>Other questions are also asked. Do the people concerned, viz. the lotholders or the communal owners of a piece of land, have any right to demand anything of these committees? I do not believe it happens in every case but I know of one instance which as I say I will refer to the hon. the Minister and which I only heard of today where this problem cropped up. Is there any way in which the landowners themselves can go to the committee and demand to see its minutes or in any way consider what it has done so as to activate it to get on with the work that it has to do?</p>
<p>Finally, there is something else I do not see in the Bill, viz. any provision for the auditing of the accounts or the books of the committees concerned. There must be expenses incurred and I know that they do incur expenses. Certain levies are applied to pay for these expenses and I believe this is also something which is an omission in this Bill and which should concern the hon. the Minister.</p>
<p>With these few words and with these few suggestions to add to those of my leader, the hon. Senator Oelrich, in an attempt to help the hon. the Minister in his administration of this Bill, I welcome the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, my learned leader, the hon. Senator Oelrich, mentioned the question of the possible transfer of land to a company where difficulty arises in respect of undivided shares in land. I would like the hon. the Minister to look at this particularly because clause 13(1) provides that where the committee finds it inadvisable to transfer undivided shares in land it may decide to sell the land. I would like to see provision made whereby the committee will have the power, with the consent of the owners of the undivided shares, to transfer the land in question to a company in which those owners shall be the shareholders. Here I refer particularly to the provisions of the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act, which the hon. the Minister has already referred to. It may well be inadvisable to transfer small pieces of land or it may be inadvisable to subdivide. In terms of the provisions of the Bill as it is now, this land will have to be sold because the owners cannot take transfer. However, if a company is formed, it will be possible to transfer the land to the owners as shareholders in that particular company.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-agriculture">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Bozas has asked the same question as the hon. Senator Oelrich. We have investigated all the possibilities and I am not exaggerating when I say that we discussed this matter for days on end with the agricultural union. The hon. Senator Webber talked about &#x201C;helping me to administer this Act&#x201D;. But that was not, in fact, what it was all about; I want to help those farmers and surely we have to take everything into consideration. Take an area like Schoemanshoek which is situate between Oudtshoorn and the Cango Caves. Over the years the people there have established their own church congregation and new agricultural techniques as well as new irrigation schemes have been introduced. Land which was more or less uneconomic, became economic. Today those people are prosperous and just to give an example I may add that they have now started to export onion seed. Some of them are economically strong and others less strong but they could not institute court proceedings and no individual could prove that the land belonged to him. This Bill has seen the light of day because of the position that obtained at George and Oudtshoorn. We told the people there to come together and to appoint a committee. As regards the suggestion that a company should be registered, I just want to draw attention to the fact that there may be a case where a person has died childless and has bequeathed his share in the land to someone living in England. If a company is formed people will say that they are shareholders in a company of which some shareholders are spread all over the world. The solution in these cases is to identify the land of each person and to have it registered in his name. We told them that the Surveyor-General would assist them and that we would assist them further by arranging survey fees at a special tariff. We asked them to point out the beacons and told them that everybody had to agree as to where the beacons were and that after that we would see to the registration of the transfers. It is difficult to circumscribe this in legislation Sir. The people pointed out the beacons after notices had appeared in the Press. It had to be brought home to the interested parties that after the notice had appeared in three consecutive issues of the newspaper the beacons would be pointed out That worked like a charm; everyone was happy and the matter was resolved. But if we had told those people to form a company they would have said: &#x201C;But we are not satisfied with that because some of the shareholders in this company want to sell to a complete stranger and we do not want him as a shareholder in this company; he can own land but we do not want him as a shareholder in our company.&#x201D; There are many difficulties connected with this matter. I think the hon. Senator&#x2019;s suggestion is a good one but that is not what those people want.</p>
<p>We had a similar position at Clanwilliam and at Langkloof where the people said unequivocally: &#x201C;Help us to take transfer the easiest way possible.&#x201D; I am pleased that the hon. Senator La Grange has referred to Clanwilliam and Langkloof because when one talks to those people one realizes how they are looking forward to this legislation.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Du Toit is quite right. Once the man has taken transfer the Soil Conservation Act can be applied to him but the Soil Conservation Act cannot be applied to a company.</p>
<p>†The hon. Senator Webber asked a few very important questions. First of all I want to say that the Paarl Mountain Disposal Bill was discussed whilst I was Deputy Minister of Agriculture, and the Afrikaans translation of &#x201C;Paarl Mountain Disposal Bill&#x201D; was &#x201C;Paarlberg Beskikkingswetsontwerp&#x201D;, and there is a big difference between &#x201C;be-skikking&#x201D; and &#x201C;disposal&#x201D;. &#x201C;Beskikking&#x201D; is more descriptive. I agree that it was the wrong word. He told me that when I was Deputy Minister ten years ago, and now after ten years he starts rubbing salt in the wound.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Webber says this Committee does not need to reply to anybody, and it is not necessary for them to report progress on what they are doing. I should like to read something to him. Unfortunately it is in Afrikaans, but he is fully bilingual. I read&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am still leaving the door open so if circumstances arise where this practice cannot be applied we can take that specific case back to Parliament and get special permission to meet their special problem in those areas.</p>
<p>The main thing is that the hon. Senator Webber can rest assured that this Bill has resulted entirely from our experience of these cases in George and Oudtshoorn. We found that this was the right way to act. Should we find in practice that land owners feel that there are still certain things which should be altered, I shall take the liberty of coming back to this hon. House.</p>
<p>*But, Sir, the process must start at the very beginning. Those people cannot each get his individual subdivided share. Mr. P. K. le Roux and Mr. Stephen le Roux who were the members of Parliament for Oudtshoorn eventually threw in the towel, and as a result of the sympathetic approach adopted by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure which summoned all the people concerned, as well as the Surveyor-General and the magistrate, to attend a round-table conference in order to work out some plan for the farmers, I brought the matter to Parliament All the parties agreed that this was good legislation, that it would assist the people and that it had to go through. That was the origin of this legislation.</p>
<p>†I think the hon. member can rest assured that if there is something wrong with the books and they have not been audited, as part and parcel of the community farm, they can refer the matter back to the Minister or to the Secretary of the Department. We can investigate the whole matter, but I cannot see how a lot of farmers on, say, 10 000 or 15 000 ha, can subdivide and have a repetition of what happened in the past with a certain department where a lot of money was wasted. I cannot see that happening in this instance. The hon. Senator need not worry; we are not taking any chances with this.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause deals with the establishment of the committee. I can find no other place in the Bill to raise this matter, as I think you will agree with me, Sir. I thank the hon. the Minister for his explanation and I accept his <i>bona fides</i> and I accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the department. I know precisely what they are trying to achieve, but I shall be putting a series of questions to the hon. the Minister concerning this particular project, this particular case, which has arisen where there are problems. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that whereas this is not provided for in the Bill at the moment, I think the time will come when he will have to consider introducing amendments, because this now becomes an omnibus Bill which covers all future pieces of land which will be designated in terms of clause 2. He is going to have to include provision whereby these committees, after they have been established, will have to report to the department or to the Minister, so that he can monitor the progress they are making. He will have to introduce an amendment to provide for the auditing of the books in terms of clause 13 referring to the transfer and distribution of proceeds. Money as well as land is involved here, and I believe that these accounts must be subject to audit. There is no provision here for audit and it is all very well for the hon. the Minister to reply to me and to say that the persons concerned have the right to object to the hon. the Minister. This is like the establishment of the Metropolitan Police Force, in England. Their prime function was the prevention of crime, not the detection of crime. The hon. the Minister cannot insert this type of provision into the Bill at this stage because time does not permit it. At this stage of the passage of the Bill through Parliament we do not have the time to work on amendments of this nature. But I want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider&#x2014; even if it is next session&#x2014;effecting amendments that will insert an element of prevention into what I consider is good legislation. I am not criticizing this legislation at all, Sir, but I see it as a way of improving the legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to refer to the remarks I made during the Second Reading debate to which the hon. the Minister replied. He said there were difficulties with private companies because the people may have shareholders from different areas or from overseas or who may wish to sell out. I want to make it clear that in the case of private companies the articles of association usually provide&#x2014; as a matter of fact, they must provide&#x2014;that shares may not be transferred unless under certain circumstances, except to the remaining shareholders in the particular company. So there are restrictions on the transferability of shareholdings. If the land is transferred to a company with the consent of the owners of the undivided shares it will create an avenue for transferring the land in one block instead of in the form of divided shares. We do not have the time to go into this question fully so I will let the hon. the Minister have the draft of the amendment which I had intended to move so that he and his department can study it during the recess and perhaps come forward with a similar amendment during the next session. I would suggest that the formation of private companies may well be preferable to transferring land in undivided shares or the subdivision of land into small pieces.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to see the amendment of the hon. Senator. If it is going to help us in respect of this Bill I shall come back to the House with it next year&#x2014;if it is practical. As far as clause 13 is concerned one may find&#x2014;there is no such case at the moment&#x2014;that there is a farm with 10 owners. However, it will not be an economic proposition to subdivide that farm into 10 pieces. Those 10 owners may then agree to sell to one of them or to somebody else. They can sell it by tender or by public auction and then divide the money among themselves. Agreement is the main aspect as far as this clause is concerned. I should like to see the amendment, however. If it can assist such people I am in favour of it, provided it is practical.</p>

<p>Mr. President, in spite of all the objections that have been raised against this legislation, I think it is a step in the right direction. I trust only that the hon. the Minister will bear in mind the possibility of something still going awry. I do feel, however, that the hon. the Minister has a good case. There may be people from my area who are overseas and who are not even aware of the fact that they have a share in a specific piece of land. Those people cannot be traced and that actually delays any soil conservation steps that may be taken. Because there are so many cases where the land is being subdivided, the question of soil conservation becomes of greater importance in this regard than in the case of other units of land. That is why I think this is a step in the right direction in spite of the fact that there may perhaps be shortcomings. I support the legislation wholeheartedly and I know the farming community support it. In spite of the fact that irregularities may take place I believe the department will see to it that the subdivision is done as equitably as possible. As a whole, however, I regard this legislation as a step in the right direction. It is something that should have been placed on the Statute Book a long time ago and if exceptional cases do arise, they can always be raised in Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. President I move subject to Standing Order No. 56&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The Co-operative Societies Act 1939 consolidated the previous legislation with regard to co-operative societies, but has itself been amended on seven occasions since its acceptance 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Developments which have taken place over the years in co-operatives, as well as the implementation of those recommendations of the Steenkamp Commission which were accepted by the Government, now necessitate the revision of the Act in its entirety. Consequently the Act is being rewritten at present and will be published as soon as possible for general information and comment. Unfortunately the provision contained in the Bill before this House today, cannot be held over until the Bill is rewritten. These provisions concern the assistance the Government is at present giving farmers in the drought-stricken areas of this country and seek to effect some improvement in the security of cooperatives with regard to amounts owing by members.</p>
<p>As a result of the serious conditions of drought in the Western Cape and in certain parts of the summer maize areas, especially in the Transvaal and Free State the Government has decided to grant the Land Bank a guarantee that production loans which co-operatives in these areas granted to their members in respect of the past 1978-&#x2019;79 production season and the new 1979-&#x2019;80 season from Land Bank funds, will be repaid over a period of four years. This arrangement enables the co-operatives to grant their members, too, postponement of repayment of debts.</p>
<p>When a co-operative provides production requisites to its members on credit, it automatically obtains security in terms of section 96 of the Act, viz. the right of pledge on the products produced by those production requisites.</p>
<p>However, if there have been no or poor yields owing to drought, for example, there is naturally nothing or very little on which the co-operative can obtain a right of pledge. Obviously this can happen in successive years.</p>
<p>Although the co-operative is, therefore, finally accountable to the Land Bank for outstanding production credit after four years, the co-operative may in the circumstances outlined in the previous paragraph, have no or insufficient security in respect of amounts owing by members.</p>
<p>In these circumstances co-operatives have made representations to me that section 96 of the Act be amended to provide in addition that when a State guaranteed credit scheme for co-operatives and their members is in effect and a member&#x2019;s production for a specific year is insufficient, the produce of that member in the subsequent years should be regarded as being pledged to the cooperative, and this should include the member&#x2019;s debt of the previous years as well.</p>
<p>I regard this request from the co-operatives as being a reasonable one and consequently this Bill is being worded in such a way as to achieve this aim.</p>
<p>As is customary, consultations with organized agriculture took place before the introduction of the Bill.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I may just mention that, as hon. Senators know, an amount of R25 million was loaned to co-operative societies in this area while an amount of R90 million was loaned to them in the summer wheat producing areas so as to enable co-operative societies to carry their members for a period of four years. Our experience is that if it is a good year the farmer is only too pleased to pay his debts even though the rate of interest is subsidized to the tune of 3&#x00BD;%. In terms of section 96 co-operative societies only have a lien on the harvest of the year concerned. In future the farmers will have a period of grace of four years. Hon. Senators may ask whether four years is a sufficiently long period. But we had to determine a date as far as the period of indebtedness was concerned. I believe that we shall have normal years again, but if four years prove insufficient, we can revise the period at that stage. At the moment this is merely a practical arrangement to stipulate the period of the lien of the cooperative societies. I think the hon. Senator Oelrich will welcome this arrangement with acclamation because he knows co-operative societies inside out, and he knew them even before I was born. I take it that the legislation will be unanimously accepted.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister was quite right when he said that we in these benches would support this legislation. I think this legislation is essential in the circumstances which the hon. the Minister has described. He will recall that during the past few years I have on numerous occasions pointed out the difficult circumstances that we as farmers could expect. It so happened that we encountered those difficulties much sooner than expected. I think the methods employed and the guarantee that is given to the co-operative societies so that they can assist their members are very reasonable and we shall support the legislation.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#visser">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we on this side also support this amending bill. However, I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that our agricultural industry, especially the cooperative societies, is faced with another problem that needs attention. I want to refer to two problems. They concern the debts of the farming community to these co-operative societies and the ability of the farmers to pay their debts timeously.</p>
<p>There is a defect in the financing of our cooperative societies, namely the ratio between private capital and borrowed capital, the ratio being one to two. The actual position as at 30 June 1977 was that the agricultural cooperative societies and the specialist agricultural co-operative societies owned private capital amounting to R708 million while their borrowed capital, in the short-term as well as in the long-term, amounted to R1 431 million. Over 90% of the borrowed capital was in the form of short-term loans. If that position proves anything, it proves that there is an element of a high degree of illiquidity. Sir, I know of few financial institutions that will regard such a ratio between their private capital and their borrowed capital as sound financing. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to that position.</p>
<p>The second aspect that is linked with that is the ability of the farming community to meet its obligations towards the co-operative societies, and <i>vice versa.</i> This has to do with an element of orderliness in the co-operative society movement. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that, as he very well knows, there are certain aspects in the co-operative society movement in South Africa that are not sound. I refer to the measure of overlapping that one finds, particularly on the part of certain countrywide general co-operative societies as against specialist co-operative societies. The hon. the Minister knows that many of the primary cooperative societies are very dissatisfied with the competition they encounter from the country-wide co-operative societies that are very powerful and operate over a very wide field. The very existence of those primary cooperative societies that are confined to a certain area is often jeopardized because of unfair competition on the part of the big, powerful and country-wide co-operative societies that cover a very wide field.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#visser">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes. There are country-wide co-operative societies including commercial co-operative societies that can trade in practically everything, even the buying and selling of property and in various products. The activities of those co-operative societies overlap to a considerable extent the activities of those co-operative societies that are restricted as far as their area of operation and the products that they can handle are concerned. That is an unhealthy state of affairs and it endangers their financial stability. Present conditions do not augur well for the future and the years that lie ahead of us may be some of the most difficult that our agricultural industry has experienced for many years. The time has arrived for us to put our co-operative society house in order. We have proof of and appreciate the good work that is being done and the efforts being made by the hon. the Minister. We know what he is trying to do. I want to tell him, however, that it is no use relying on voluntary co-operation in order to put matters right in the co-operative society movement. He will not be able to do so because he will come up against the question of self-interest in those societies. Any monopoly is an unhealthy monopoly, whether it be a Government monopoly, a co-operative society monopoly or a private monopoly. It is unhealthy. However, there is a difference in the case of a Government monopoly because in that case, at least, it involves the interests of the public in general and in some cases such a monopoly is justified. But that cannot be said of a private monopoly or of a co-operative society monopoly. If there is a possibility of the problem being met on a voluntary basis, I agree that we should try to do so but I repeat that I do not think we will succeed. I want to know whether the time has not arrived for the hon. the Minister to appoint an independent works committee that can investigate the position thoroughly in order to ascertain what can be done to solve the problem. It is a real problem that is being experienced over a large part of the country. It has financial implications for the State because it has financial implications for the co-operative societies and the farmer. It is in the interests of the country as a whole, therefore, that the question be tackled in all seriousness.</p>
<p>I want to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister today to see whether a works committee cannot be appointed. Such a committee can make recommendations and, if they are accepted, this will enable him to take action although naturally he will never be able to satisfy everybody. The dear Lord cannot satisfy everyone so how can such a committee satisfy everyone? But he will be acting in the interests of the country and in the interests of the farming community as a whole. Therefore I put this matter to the hon. the Minister for his serious consideration.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I thank the hon. Senator Oelrich for the attitude which he has adopted and which I, in fact, expected him to adopt. The hon. Senator Dr. Visser referred to private capital and borrowed capital of the co-operative societies. He is the chairman of the S.A.K.K. and he knows about these matters. All along I have advised the co-operative societies to impose a levy in the good years in order to build up a savings fund for their members that can serve as a kind of insurance to those members even if they only get 6% on their investment. A wool farmer, for example, is quite satisfied that the Wool Board should impose a levy and at the moment that fund stands at R70 million and it will still reach a figure of R100 million. The farmers are having a hard time today but they would have had some relief had the respective co-operative societies imposed a levy during the good years. During the good years, I, as a farmer, was prepared to pay into my co-operative society in the form of a levy 5% or 6% of the proceeds of the sale of my products. That would then have formed part of a rotating levy fund and my share could have been refunded to me after four years. But if the fourth year was a good year I may have been prepared to leave the levy with the co-operative society and only claim the interest. Then if one experienced a lean year, as is the case this year, the co-operative society would have had a reserve fund and the financial position of that society would also have been much more liquid.</p>
<p>We produce agricultural products to the value of R4 000 million annually and if we take 1% of that amount we can establish our own Land Bank. Today we have to go hat in hand in order to obtain a few rands whereas we could have built up our own fund. The hon. Senator and I talk the same language as far as this is concerned but this is an educational process that takes a long time.</p>
<p>There are specialist co-operative societies in the country. It was a historic occasion when BKB received certain powers because of the take-over of FCU and other types of co-operative societies that were entitled at the time to operate in that field. The hon. Senator has asked for the appointment of a works committee. It was my intention to refer this matter to the Co-operative Council so that we could discuss this matter together, because I agree that the hon. Senator has a very strong point. We shall go into the matter, therefore, because we do not want co-operative societies to quarrel among themselves or one to encroach upon the sphere of activity of another one because there is room for specialization. I believe that we may be covering too wide a field with the result that the whole machinery eventually becomes cumbersome and this gives rise to problems. I shall bear the requests by the hon. Senator in mind and discuss them with the Co-operative Council. If necessary, we can perhaps appoint a committee at a later stage.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I was asked a moment ago whether we wanted the Bill to be committed and I said yes for the simple reason that I had listened attentively to the speech of the hon. Senator Dr. Visser. While he was speaking I interjected and when he sat down I said &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister has replied to the Second Reading debate and said that he would bear in mind the request made by the hon. Senator Dr. Visser. I am pleased to know that, because as someone who has been concerned with this matter for many years, I think it is of the utmost importance that this matter be reviewed. I am exceedingly worried about the position that has developed lately in respect of monopolies. That is something that we do not want in this country. Sir, I believe in competition. When it comes to the question of conducting one&#x2019;s business, one should be able to state one&#x2019;s case to the best of one&#x2019;s ability and there should not be any monopolies. As the position is developing today, however, that is the greatest danger we face in the co-operative society sphere.</p>
<p>There is one other matter I want to mention. The hon. Senator Dr. Visser has asked for the appointment of a works committee. I do not know what the difference is between a works committee and a committee, but no matter what type of committee is appointed, it must act quickly and drastically because this matter must be put right. It makes no difference whether it is a works committee or an ordinary committee; all it has to do is to rectify the position as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am in complete agreement with the hon. Senator Oelrich but I have a problem in this connection. The co-operative societies and the agricultural unions were very annoyed with me last year&#x2014;I am referring to the statement by the hon. Senator that he favours competition&#x2014;for refusing to introduce a one-channel marketing scheme for grain sorghum. I suggested the fing of a floor price for the farmer because that would guarantee him a minimum price. He would then be free to go around and bargain for a better price. If Kagan&#x2019;s Mills of Leslie are prepared to pay me 50 cents more per bag, I will take it and pocket it. But they asked for the introduction of a one-channel marketing scheme which would have left the power solely in the hands of the co-operative societies. Had I done so the farmer would not have had any bargaining power; he would have been in a straitjacket. That is one of the problems we have to cope with and that is why I appreciate the fact that both the hon. Senator Oelrich and the hon. Senator Dr. Visser are of the opinion that we must not act in such a way that it will give rise to monopolies with the result that the farmers will eventually have no bargaining power when it comes to selling their products. I want protection, stability and continuity. Give the farmer a floor price but tell him also that he can get a better price when there is a shortage.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move subject to Standing Order No. 56&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Our law of divorce, except for certain rules of procedure and a single statutory enactment which makes provision for divorce on the ground of mental illness and habitual criminality, is of a common law nature. Under common law there are two grounds for divorce, namely adultery and malicious desertion. Both grounds for divorce are based on the guilt principle. This means that the innocent party may obtain a divorce on the ground of the misconduct of the guilty party. It also means that the guilty party normally cannot sue for divorce because he has no recognized ground for divorce. We know from experience, however, that the blame for the failure of a marriage seldom lies with one of the spouses only. For that reason the guilt requirement which applies in our present divorce law is the principal cause of problems that are being experienced in the divorce law.</p>
<p>It has been clear for a considerable length of time now that our divorce law is not satisfactory in all respects. That is why the S.A. Law Commission commenced an inquiry into the divorce law during 1975. The commission made a study of the existing divorce law and compared it to present-day developments in other legal systems. The commission consulted a large number of persons and bodies and also heard oral evidence. The problems and the unsatisfactory aspects of the divorce law were identified. The Bill now before this House is the product of the commission&#x2019;s inquiry and deliberations.</p>
<p>It is an indisputable fact that marriage as an institution continues to be one of the cornerstones of a healthy society. That is why there is concern in all quarters at the high divorce rate in South Africa. However, I must emphasize at once that the Bill is not aimed at curbing divorce. The breakdown of marriages is a social problem which cannot be solved by the legislature. It must be accepted that the law as such can achieve little to counteract the problem. However, the law must be constructed in such a way that it will not be an obstacle to other resources which are being utilized to counteract the breakdown of marriages but will tend instead to supplement such resources.</p>
<p>The principles embodied in the Bill are dealt with in some detail in the report of the commission. The report was tabled on 10 May 1978. Since then it has been freely available. A supplementary report was also tabled on 24 April 1979. Consequently I shall deal only with the most important principles for which provision is being made in the Bill, and I shall do so very briefly.</p>
<p>The Bill seeks to make irretrievable breakdown of a marriage the basis for divorce. By irretrievable breakdown of a marriage is meant that the marriage relationship has disintegrated to such an extent that there is no reasonable prospect of a normal marriage relationship being resumed. The court has to be satisfied that the marriage has indeed disintegrated to such an extent. In order to determine the degree of disintegration of a marriage relationship the court may take the attitude of the spouses towards one another and towards their marriage relationship into consideration. Accordingly the guilt principle is being abandoned. Adultery and malicious desertion will no longer constitute grounds for divorce <i>per se.</i> They are included in the comprehensive grounds for divorce of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. However, they may still be taken into consideration as factors which indicate an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.</p>
<p>Although it must be accepted as a fact that reconciliation cannot be forced upon the spouses, it is important that they be afforded sufficient opportunity to become reconciled. Provision is being made for this in clause 4(4).</p>
<p>In clause 5 provision is being made for divorce on the grounds of the mental illness or continuous unconsciousness of a spouse. The principle is the same as the present one, but the stringent requirements, particularly in regard to the prescribed period that has to elapse, are being relaxed to some extent.</p>
<p>In clause 6 the principle is being laid down that the interests of children of the marriage should be accorded the highest priority. The granting of a decree of divorce is being made subject to the requirement that the best possible arrangements in the circumstances shall be effected in respect of the children. The court may of its own volition cause an investigation into the interests of the children to be carried out and may order that they shall have independent legal representation.</p>
<p>In clause 7 provision is being made for the maintenance of the parties after divorce. Under our present law only an innocent party is entitled to payment of maintenance by the guilty party. As a result of certain apparent problems on the clause which were submitted to me, the Law Commission was asked to reconsider the proposed arrangement. A supplementary report on the views of the commission in this connection was tabled on 24 April 1979. The amendments recommended in this report have already been effected in the Other Place.</p>
<p>When it is a question of the forfeiture of the patrimonial benefits of a marriage the blameworthiness of a spouse in connection with the disintegration of the marriage cannot of course be disregarded. However, the present legal position in terms of which the court is obliged to make an order that the benefits be forfeited if this is requested and the divorce action succeeds, is unsatisfactory. Clause 9 seeks to give the court a discretion. In addition it is being envisaged that the conduct of a spouse shall only be taken into consideration as a factor, but not necessarily the only or determining factor. Provision is also being made for the court to order the partial forfeiture of benefits.</p>
<p>As far as litigation costs are concerned, the Bill seeks in clause 10 to relax the strict rule that a successful party is entitled to costs. Provision is being made enabling the court to take into consideration the means of the parties, and their conduct, in so far as it may be relevant, and to apportion the costs between them. This idea is bound up with the new dispensation under which not only the so-called innocent party but either of the spouses may institute the divorce action.</p>
<p>In clause 12 provision is being made for limitation of the publication of particulars of divorce proceedings. The object is to eliminate sensational reporting of intimate, personal matters which could be extremely prejudicial to the parties and particularly to the children of the marriage. The general public only has an interest in a divorce in so far as it affects the status of the parties. Provision is being made for the fact of the divorce to be published. Representations on the clause were submitted to me by the Press Union. The Law Commission was requested to consider these representations as well and to receive a delegation from the Press Union. The findings of the commission are also dealt with in the supplementary report to which I have already referred. Amendments proposed in the report have already been effected in the Other Place.</p>
<p>Judicial separation is the result of the inflexible requirements of the common law grounds for divorce. It is in conflict with the idea that dead marriages ought not to be maintained. Neither is it in keeping with the grounds for divorce of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. Consequently provi sion is being made in clause 14 for the abolition of judicial separation.</p>
<p>Mr. President, according to the Law Commission report the object which the commission set itself was to recommend realistic rules for the law of divorce&#x2014;i.e. rules which, in the words of the commission&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; are in keeping with present-day needs, &#x2026; of society in general, and which do not lose sight of society&#x2019;s conception of what is reasonable and just.</block>
<p>I submit that the commission succeeded very well indeed in its aims. In my opinion the commission deserves the thanks and appreciation of this House for a major task which it has performed extremely well.</p>

<p>Mr. President, there is an old saying, &#x201C;Great minds think alike; fools seldom differ.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister can take his pick, but he and I are not differing on this legislation. It is in fact very important legislation and I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. the Minister when he says that the Law Commission and everybody concerned with this legislation are to be congratulated. I think it has brought our divorce laws out of the realms of the archaic into the modern context. I must say that the Bill has improved considerably by reason of its passage through the Other Place. The amendments which were effected there are good amendments and have improved the legislation.</p>
<p>We on these benches think that the Bill is good in principle because it changes the old concept that husband and wife should seek in a court in open conflict the establishment of a guilt situation in respect of one party or another. The hon. the Minister referred to that in his speech and I do not want to labour the point, but that is the situation now. Unseemly and distasteful battles take place in court in order to establish the guilt of one party of the other, which to my mind is totally archaic. This Bill approaches the whole situation from a different point of view and is a vast improvement</p>
<p>I am pleased also that the old concept of the order for the restitution of conjugal rights goes, because really that was basically a farce. It had no meaning and was a total farce. The abolition of the judicial separation system is also to be welcomed very much indeed. I personally have known of cases where one party to a failed marriage has held the other to ransom by getting a judicial separation and refusing to allow proceedings for a divorce. One came across tragic situations on that basis and the abolition of this system is also a great improvement on the present system.</p>
<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister a question as regards clause 7. This clause, as amended, deals with the question of maintenance and it lays down that a court can specify the period during which maintenance shall be paid until either the remarriage or the death of the spouse receiving the maintenance. What is not entirely clear from the legislation as it stands, is what the position is as regards the liability of the estate of the party paying the maintenance. I know there is the Copelowitz case, but this case itself is not entirely clear. The Copelowitz case did have as part of its situation the fact that the consent paper did make a reference to a liability on the part of the person paying the maintenance after his death out of his estate. This Bill is not specific with regard to the question of the liability of an estate in respect of the surviving spouse when that surviving spouse is receiving the maintenance. The Bill as it stands certainly gives a court the discretion to determine the period during which maintenance shall be paid, with a limit when the death of the receiver of maintenance occurs or on the remarriage of the receiver of maintenance. However, it is not specific about the question of the liability of an estate and I would like to have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comments on that particular point.</p>
<p>We come now to the question of clause 12 which prohibits publication. I would say to the hon. the Minister that I am entirely in favour of that clause. I am one of those people who believes that the Press should publish everything that it can publish in the public interest. When there are matters which affect the public interest, the interests of the State and the interests of the people as a whole, then I think the Press should be permitted to publish to the limit set by the laws of defamation and criminal libel. But publication of the intimate details of divorce cases has nothing at all to do with the public interest and publication of details of that sort is used by newspapers to build circulation among the prurient and the inquisitive and the people who have nothing better to do but read those details. The gutter press uses that sort of report to attract readers and boost circulation. I think that this provision is entirely justified and correct because it prohibits the publication of matters which have nothing to do with the public interest in any way at all. It permits publication of the names of the parties and of the order made by the court, and that is enough. The sordid details of marital conflicts have no place in the Press or anywhere else. I approve of this whole Bill and of the clause as drafted and amended and my colleagues do likewise. We shall support the Bill and we shall concede all stages to the hon. the Minister. The amendments brought about in the Other Place make the Bill an entirely acceptable measure.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, after reading the original and supplementary reports of the Law Commission and listening to the introductory Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister, in addition to the comments of the hon. Senator Horak, there is really very little left to be said about this matter. Before I express a few thoughts, I should just like to refer to two points which the hon. Senator Horak raised.</p>
<p>The first point the hon. Senator raised is whether it is necessary to expressly define to what extent an estate shall benefit. I have looked at the relevant clause myself and have satisfied myself regarding the exact wording that is used. In line 10 on page 8, the words &#x201C;by one party to the other&#x201D; appear. My interpretation&#x2014;rightly or wrongly&#x2014;is that the word &#x201C;party&#x201D; here includes the person&#x2019;s estate. If we speak of Mr. A having entered into a contract then it is an obligation and his estate is responsible for carrying out the provisions of that contract. That is how I see it.</p>
<p>The other point with which I want to agree completely with the hon. Senator Horak is the question of publication. I think we have often noticed at our schools and universities that when a report appears in the newspapers about divorce proceedings, the spicier it is the more attractive reading material it provides for these people. I have even seen a newspaper being passed from one student and from one scholar to another, with the bad effect this has, notwithstanding the unenviable position in which the children of the parents concerned are placed. I think this is very good legislation and I am sorry that it did not come sooner.</p>
<p>Mr. President, if I might be permitted to express a few thoughts in this regard, I should like to say that the marriage contract is one of the oldest customs which runs like a gold thread through civilization. The marriage ties are dealt with in many chapters of our greatest Statute Book, the Bible. The Ten Commandments also deal with the question of the break-up of a marriage. This shows how important it is. I say again that marriage as an institution has run like a gold thread through civilization. From that great Statute Book it was transferred to our Roman Law and thereafter to our Roman Dutch Law. Since then marriage, the joining of man and woman, has been regarded as one of the most important aspects of our legislation. Chapter after chapter has been written about it, but I shall not go into that now. These marriage laws have, of course, been adapted with the passing of time, as the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech when he referred us to the grounds for divorce.</p>
<p>Accordingly a marriage is defined as a <i>familias</i> and it is a special contract which is entered into. The contract is entered into with a view to procreation. This aspect is so important that if one party to such a contract should deceive the other by not revealing that he or she is not able to procreate, having been aware of this at the time of the marriage, then in terms of our law it is possible for such a marriage to be annulled. There is also the provision that in the case of an illegitimate child, such a child can be declared legitimate when a marriage takes place at a later date. This is also based on the concept of <i>familias</i> because we want to ensure that sound marriages are built up.</p>
<p>With the passing of time some things occur which make this impossible; for instance, the question of malicious desertion. If one maliciously deserts one&#x2019;s marriage partner, then that contract which was entered into with a view to developing the marriage state is broken. There is also the question of imprisonment and being declared a habitual criminal. If a person becomes a habitual criminal he is no longer a party to that marriage who is present and he then also breaks that contract of development. The same thing applies to mental disorder.</p>
<p>It is a basic principle of our law that this is a contract which the parties enter into but which may not be cancelled by mutual agreement. That is why the basis of the Bill before us is that desertion and judicial separation are sufficient in my opinion to detract from the basic idea that it is a contract which the parties cannot cancel by mutual agreement. There is also the other important aspect which the hon. the Minister dealt with in his Second Reading speech, namely that of the children. It is also a contract which one enters into in respect of one&#x2019;s children. The fruits of one&#x2019;s procreation cannot be decided upon only by the parents. When we have brought children into the world, we assume an obligation. The court, of course, is at all times the supreme guardian of the minor and other dependent children. The parents, i.e. the contracting parties, cannot do what they please; they cannot leave that child to the mercy of the world. The court is the supreme guardian and I think this is put very clearly in this legislation.</p>
<p>A very important provision was inserted in the Wills Act a few years ago, namely that although a testator can dispose of his property as he pleases, this elementary right is subject to the condition that the minor child&#x2019;s interests may not be overlooked. The minor child has a claim on the estate; the parent brought that child into the world and there is an obligation on the parent to ensure that the minor and other dependent children are adequately provided for. If we analyse this legislation, we shall see that very careful attention has been given to this aspect.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister referred to the fact that desertion will now fall away as grounds for divorce. Those of us who have practised for many years know that two persons who have entered into such a marriage contract cannot <i>inter se</i> summarily cancel it. If the parties have entered into a settlement, the contract must be approved by the court to ensure that it is not <i>contra bonos mores</i>, and that provision is made for minor children. In practice there are cases of separation by way of notarial contract and after some years it becomes a judicial deed approved by the court. That notarial contract is an agreement to live apart and is contrary to the basic idea of a marriage contract that cannot be cancelled.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has already expressed his appreciation and thanks to the Law Commission. I want to add my thanks and appreciation to this. I think they have done a wonderful job of work. I think they have taken a most objective view of the matter and have tackled the matter correctly from the start. With your leave, Mr. President I want to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the late Mr. D. D. van Niekerk, a senior advocate who was a member of the commission. He was a person who rendered outstanding service to the legal profession. We know how many Bills he drafted or on which he collaborated. I think for instance of the intricate Criminal Procedure Act which we discussed for many days. He was an approachable person; he was a person with the necessary legal knowledge and I think it is fitting that I should pay tribute to his memory with these few words.</p>
<p>As I have already said, attorneys are often inclined to see dangers where no real danger exists. But I want to mention three points to the hon. the Minister in the draft Bill before us which could possibly receive attention later. The first is in regard to clause 7. In terms of clause 7 parties can conclude an agreement in respect of apportionment of the assets of the estate. In this connection I just want to refer to our Transfer Duty Act Section 9(e) of that Act provides for the exemption from payment of transfer duty if persons have entered into an agreement for the apportionment of the estate in the case of a deceased estate. In terms of section 9(1) no transfer duty is payable where two persons are married in community of property and whose assets are apportioned because of the divorce. If one party&#x2019;s share is more than half the estate, transfer duty is payable on that portion which exceeds the value of half the estate. Those of us in practice know from experience that cases occur where one of the parties fears that the other party will remarry at some later dage to the prejudice of the children born of the marriage. To overcome this fear, provision is made in the documents which are drawn up to the effect that certain of the joint or separate assets in the estate go to the children. I think that attention should be paid to this aspect. Cannot provision be made that that portion of the estate apportioned to the children should also be exempt from transfer duty and donations tax? I know from experience that it is one of the major problems in divorce to ensure that part of the assets in the estate go to the children. I mention this for what it is worth, Sir.</p>
<p>Another point I want to mention involves to clauses 1 and 6. This relates to definitions. In both cases reference is made to minor children born of the marriage. As I interpret the Bill, it does not cover the case of an adopted child. Clause 1 refers to litigation in regard to children born of the marriage. Clause 6 deals with the position of awards to children born of the marriage. We know there are childless parents who adopt a child. I have had cases where such a minor adopted child has become a bone of contention. If I am right in my approach, if I am right in the difficulty I foresee, is it not perhaps necessary to define a child so as to include a legally adopted child? As I read the Bill, it does not cover an adopted child; it only covers children born of the marriage.</p>
<p>Another case I want to mention in this regard is the child born as a result of artificial insemination. We know that there is a court decision&#x2014;I do not know what will transpire in a possible appeal&#x2014;in which it was stated that only the mother was the parent of the child. In my view we do not know at this stage what the position of such a child born as a result of artificial insemination will be in terms of this clause. As I interpret the Bill, such a child is not covered. I raise this point again for what it is worth, Sir. Perhaps it will be necessary for us to consider this again. There might be a court decision in the meantime in this respect, but I do think, especially where adopted children are concerned, that the position must be rectified. We must state clearly that such children are also covered by the legislation.</p>
<p>The next point I want to mention is the question of publicity. I think I also dealt with this in regard to previous legislation. I feel somewhat unhappy about the provision in regard to publicity as presently stated in the Bill. It is stated that there shall be no publication. What in fact does publication entail? Does it necessarily mean in a news paper, a book or a pamphlet? I am thinking here, for instance, of the question of libel. If I, for instance, make a libellous allegation about somebody while only the two of us are present, I am criminally liable. But if, for instance, by way of discussion, I give publicity to a libellous allegation, more persons will know about it and I will be liable in terms of the libel laws. This might present a problem, and the following question also occurs to me. If I were to attend a meeting where persons A and B were referred to by name, and where the question was asked whether justice had been done to the minor children, and so on, it could be said that this was publication.</p>
<p>As far as this third point is concerned, I do think though that the hon. the Minister and his department can in course of time consider this. There might be an occasion in the not too distant future when we have a court decision in regard to this position, i.e. the publicity angle. Supposing I raised certain marital matters at a meeting or in my home and the wife were to say, especially in a case where the husband had remarried, that she thought the children had been badly treated and had not received their rightful share? Could that really be regarded as publication? As I said previously, perhaps I am seeing spectres where there are none.</p>

<p>I merely mention that I should like to know where and when it is regarded as publication. As I understand it, it may not be published publicly. Where is &#x201C;publicly&#x201D;, to what extent has it been mentioned publicly, and where is the line to be drawn? Are the things that are said in my home said publicly? If I stand on my stoep or in the street and talk to someone, does that take place publicly? I mention these three points in the hope that they may be considered in due course. In particular I should, however, particularly like to stress the question of a minor child adopted by the parents and who is not born of the marriage. This side of the House fully supports this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I listened with a great deal of interest to the speakers who preceded me. However, before I comment on some of the remarks they made, I would first of all like to say that my party has a free vote on this particular issue. The only regret I have is that I believe there should be more free votes on more issues in this Parliament. I think we would then have a freer expression of opinion. [Interjections.] It may be a commercial but the hon. Senator Horak knows that I have held this view for a long time, namely that I believe we should have freer discussions on matters of this sort. In any event, Mr. President, there are certainly no politics in the issue before us.</p>
<p>I want to say quite clearly that this legislation pleases me in some respects but it distresses me in others. So far all the hon. Senators who have participated in this debate have been legal men. I must confess immediately, they know more about divorce and its intricacies and difficulties than I could possibly know. My experience of legal men generally in regard to matters of divorce is that they are most compassionate, most sympathetic and in most cases they try in fact to bring about a reconcilliation when clients come to see them in regard to divorce. Therefore I do not wish anything I say to be construed as a criticism of anybody in the legal profession. [Interjections.] I have a son in the legal profession and we have debated this matter often enough. I want to make it quite clear that I am not shooting any arrows in their direction. As I say, my experience is that they are generally very compassionate in regard to people who come to see them about divorce.</p>
<p>However, I must confess that I am somewhat concerned about the legislation before us. I do not intend to exercise my free vote and vote against it. Perhaps it is my upbringing as a Roman Catholic which dictates some of the views in regard to divorce. I believe that not only we in South Africa but in the Western world generally and particularly in South Africa, because we have a very high incidence of divorce, we have moved away too readily from the whole concept which our great-grandparents had in the Victorian age. I do not know whether it is because of my background but I believe that in this respect divorce is in fact far too readily available to people who merely because they have a difference of opinion seem to be able to run off to a divorce court and get a divorce. I accept that there are difficulties and I am not a legal man. This Bill does in fact simplify the matter where divorce is essential. I must say quite clearly that I am opposed to divorce except in certain circumstances. I accept that there are circumstances where only a divorce will solve the particular problem. Therefore I accept that an irretrievable break-down, depending on what is meant by that, is probably a far better description or definition for divorce than what we had up to the present time. Having said that, I want to say too that I hope that the courts which will now have a tremendous responsibility in this respect, will apply themselves very carefully to this question of what is an irretrievable break-down and what is not.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Rensburg who spoke before me talked about contracts and, of course, he is perfectly correct Speaking in the legal sense it is a contract, I accept that. However, what we overlook is that this is a contract between human beings. It is not a contract to buy a house or sell a farm. It is a contract between two human beings. The hon. Senator Van Rensburg talked about the children, and I have very little quarrel with what he had to say. But this is in fact the problem of society today. More than 10 000 divorces take place in South Africa each year. One has to consider the consequences of those divorces on the children, if there are children and in many cases there are, and the consequences on society and on the community as a whole because of this high divorce rate. It seems to me that young people today have the belief that they can get married in a hurry without getting to know each other too well because they always have at the back of their minds that when they go through the front door with the marriage, the back door is already open, ready for divorce. They seem to take the attitude that it is not for better or for worse, or until death do us part; they think: We&#x2019;ll get married this week and if we do not like it next week we can get divorced. That is an oversimplification but it seems to me that this is the attitude of our young people. The reason why I shall not vote against this Bill is because I believe it places the onus <i>very</i> squarely on the courts to make decisions in this matter. If the courts think the matter is being too lightly treated, they will not in fact grant a divorce. This is why I must go along with and support this legislation. I am passing my remarks this afternoon mainly to express my very deep concern at our attitude and the attitude prevalent in regard to divorce in South Africa, and not only in South Africa but in the modern world. I believe this is dangerous to our society, to our community and the world in which we live. We need greater family unity than we have at present if we are to survive some of the pressures. But divorce does not create greater family unity. Mr. President, I often like to blame the hon. the Minister for many things, but I cannot blame him or the Government for our divorce rate. But I do certainly blame the churches as a whole for this state of affairs. I believe they must have failed in their role to a large extent if one looks at the high divorce rate. I blame society itself, Mr. President. I spoke to a young lady during the past week and she told me she had been living with a man for 14 years and that they had joint properties etc. I asked her why, after having lived with this man for 14 years, they had not got married, and she said: &#x201C;What is the advantage of getting married?&#x201D; This, Sir, is what worries me. Here is a couple who can live happily together for 14 years&#x2014;and I believe they could live together for the rest of their lives&#x2014; but they see no advantage in the marriage state whatsoever. This, I believe, gives cause for concern. [Interjections.] The hon. Senators may smile and laugh, but it affects everyone of us. It affects our children. I come from a family where divorce is not unknown, and I am not saying that because I have a particular attitude towards divorce people closely associated with me should have the same attitude. In fact, some of their divorces might have been highly necessary, highly desirable.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I hope I am expressing myself correctly. I am not opposed to divorce; I am opposed to easy divorce. I am opposed to the attitude of society towards marriage in general which, as I said just now, seems to be: &#x201C;We can get married today and divorced next week if it does not work out.&#x201D; This is what concerns me, Sir. And this is why I say I believe that surely, somewhere we are slipping. Surely, the churches whose main responsibility this has been for centuries, are failing in their duty if they cannot instil in our modern youth an appreciation of the value and the sanctity of the marriage vows.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I do not want to preach because there are people in this House better able to preach than I am as they have had special training in the subject.</p>

<p>Where are they this afternoon?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know where they are this afternoon. But if I have said enough in that respect, Sir, let me then deal with two other matters that I would like to mention.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Horak referred to the restriction on the Press in regard to reporting the sordid details of divorce. From the &#x201C;hear, hear!&#x201D; that he got it would appear that most of the hon. Senators present agree with him. I agree with him too to a point, but here again I have a problem. I believe too that the lurid details of divorce cases should not be reported in the Press, but I have a horrible feeling that once one starts this round-about of restrictions on the Press, it has no end. And I think here again probably the public has failed because the public allows and accepts this sort of thing from the Press. [Interjections.] Mr. President, I am not condemning anybody for this. I am merely saying that it seems to me that the public seem to accept these things so readily. If they had higher standards they would soon let the Press know that this is the sort of thing they do not want to see in the Press&#x2014;the lurid details of divorce cases. I certainly do not want to see them, Sir, but, as I say, I have this horrible feeling that once one starts on this merry-go-round, there is no getting off. And we in this Parliament have started on it, and I am telling you now, Sir, it has no end; we will go on doing it, and for very good reasons in most cases. In this instance it appears that there is a very good reason for some restriction in regard to this type of reporting. But I do not believe that this is the right way to do it. It worries me. I would not mind if this restriction on the Press was limited to this type of reporting. I would go along with that. But, Mr. President, it does not end there; it will go on and on. I am going to support this Bill because I believe the public has failed to impose its own censorship, its own restrictions on the type of reporting it would like to see in its newspapers. For that reason I must support this particular restriction today, but I do so with a great deal of doubt, a great deal of concern in my mind because, Sir, as I stand here this afternoon I can assure you, it will not end; other matters will follow. We have already had four or five Bills this session that have done exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>Mr. President, one of the things that compels me to support this particular provision, despite my doubts about it, is that there is no question about it that when the newspapers report a suicide there is a spate of suicides. If they report a person&#x2019;s jumping off a five-storey building, as in Durban, the newspapers carry the lurid details about the incident with arrows pointing towards the place where the person fell. I have watched this phenomenon very carefully. Within three or four days or weeks, another three or four people have jumped off buildings in much the same way. If it is reported that somebody has gassed himself in a motor-car, then suddenly there is a spate of people doing exactly the same thing. This is a reflection upon society. I don&#x2019;t believe it is so much a reflection upon the Press as a reflection upon society.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister a more technical question, one that, quite frankly, I do not begin to know the answer to. Could he tell me what happens in regard to maintenance where a couple are separated before they ate divorced? What happens when a man, for argument&#x2019;s sake, throws the woman out of the family home and it takes some time before divorce proceedings can be instituted? I am told that it takes anything up to six months before a divorce can be finalized, and it is only then that maintenance can be ruled upon by the courts. I want to know what happens to the spouse in that connection in the interim? Is there any method by which the question of maintenance can be speeded up? Or can there be an interim form of maintenance? The hon. Senator Koch would probably know better what I am trying to get at.</p>
<p>I am referring to a case where perhaps a divorce is not going to take place at all; where the husband kicks the wife out but no divorce is going to take place. No matter what the wife tries to do she cannot get a divorce. What arrangements can be made for maintenance in cases like that? As I as a</p>
<p>layman understand the position, maintenance is only paid when an order to that effect is issued by the court. I do not expect the hon. the Minister necessarily to reply to the comments and thoughts I have expressed in regard to divorce itself but I would be grateful if he could reply to that particular point.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-justice">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, in the first instance I want to thank hon. Senators most sincerely for their support for this Bill. This is one of those Bills we all feel the same about and each one has given expression to his feelings in this hon. Senate and in the Other Place as well in a manner which, in my humble opinion, has had regard to the highest traditions of debating. In the Other Place and here as well I have listened with appreciation to the debating of this extremely interesting and important matter.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Horak raised a very interesting question, a question on which the courts have previously differed. Various decisions have been given in this matter, namely the liability of an estate in respect of the next-of-kin. The general feeling is that such an estate is not liable, or need not be, in such a case. A husband who is not divorced has no claim to maintenance from an estate. In other words, should a person die, the surviving spouse cannot claim maintenance from the estate. The estate is then apportioned in terms of the wishes of the deceased or in some other way. There is also the argument that if that applies to people who remain married, it must apply in even greater measure to people who are divorced, and that there is no liability in respect of the wife or husband who survives. In spite of the opinion I have now expressed, the question is an interesting one.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Many problems arise for people who are divorced and who suddenly lose their means of support. I want to tell hon. Senators that I shall give the law advisers instructions to consider this matter again because it entails basic facets that must be investigated.</p>
<p>In my view the hon. Senator Van Rensburg raised three particularly interesting matters. In the Other Place we debated this Bill for almost a week. Hon. Senators will realize that many amendments were moved and discussed. Many of the amendments were eventually accepted and it may be true, as the hon. Senator Horak has pointed out, that there are really no amendments left to be moved in this Senate. There is really nothing to add to what has already been discussed and dealt with. But I find it interesting that the hon. Senator Van Rensburg has raised three absolutely fresh matters. He raised three interesting points which have not been mentioned by anybody else previously and which in my view have a lot to be said for them.</p>
<p>The first matter he raised dealt with the Transfer Duty Act which provides for exemption from transfer duty on the transfer of assets to the survivors when somebody has died. He also pointed out that apportionments take place in other circumstances. He asked if there should not be exemption from transfer duty in a divorce case where assets have been awarded to children by way of contract I want to tell the hon. Senator that this is a completely new approach which should receive attention. I shall discuss the matter with the hon. the Minister of Finance under whom the Transfer Duty Act falls, and suggest that the necessary amendment be effected to that Act. There is no doubt that the hon. Senator has a valid point in this connection.</p>
<p>His other very interesting point was whether this Bill provided for adopted children. My officials, by way of a note, have drawn my attention to the fact that the Children&#x2019;s Act does provide that an adopted child is regarded in law as a natural child in all respects. Although there is no mention of an adopted child in this specific Bill, I accept that the provisions of the Children&#x2019;s Act will cover this aspect. The hon. Senator also referred to a child born as a result of artificial insemination and asked what the position of such a child would be in the marriage.</p>
<p>As the hon. Senator rightly pointed out, this is an open question juridically speaking because legal experts have still not had occasion to consider it. But it is a question which will have to be clarified by our judiciary and our legislature. Artificial insemination is a modern development with many possibilities, and this question, quite rightly, will have to be raised again. In the meantime I shall give it the necessary consideration if the courts refer to it.</p>
<p>The third point the hon. Senator raised involves the clause in regard to the publication of the details of divorce proceedings. The question of publication referred to in clause 12 is very wide. The specific wording of the clause has been interpreted by our courts on various occasions but in spite of everything the fact remains that the Act covers a very wide field. One might well reconsider it to see whether its scope is not too wide, because the examples mentioned by the hon. Senator have considerable substance and we thank him for a very interesting speech.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion the hon. Senator Winchester made exceptional contribution to the debate in that he approached the matter as a social problem. The hon. Senator is quite correct because the marriage contract is not an ordinary contract I also said in the Other Place that the marriage contract is not one of those cold contracts where the provisions are thrashed out around a table. A marriage contract is based on human emotions. People are emotionally involved and feel a need to legalize this desire to live together. That is why they enter into matrimony. The hon. Senator mentioned the example of people who had simply lived together for 14 years. As in other countries, this custom has increased enormously in South Africa. In other countries it is almost the exception today for people to marry in church or even enter into a civil marriage contract. In South Africa it has become something of a problem these days that people simply live together. Sometimes they are happy and, if they are not, they just part. From the social point of view and from the point of view of a Christian state this is, however, a very unhealthy state of affairs. Something is seriously wrong in that people no longer respect the institution of marriage. This is regrettable but I believe that this Bill will help to a large extent to make people more prepared to marry. The divorce legislation which is operative at present is such that one can no longer believe what takes place in the courts. People have parted contractually and have then accepted the fact that they have really left one another. This legislation puts the break-up of a marriage on a realistic footing once more. The result will be that when any person is guilty of misconduct and the misconduct is of such a nature that the marriage is quite dead and has broken down irretrievably, the parties may divorce. There is then nothing to keep them together. An Act cannot hold a marriage together. But the parties must be given the opportunity to testify in court that the marriage has irretrievably broken down and that no good purpose will be served by such a couple continuing to live together and not being allowed to separate. In that respect it is not realistic. It is no easy task. The Bill does not make divorce easier, Sir. I would say that it really makes divorce more difficult because it gives the court greater authority to look behind the scenes to ascertain what really took place in a marriage and then to exercise its judicial function regarding the continuance or otherwise of the marriage. The Bill therefore has two advantages: it is more realistic and it does not make divorce easier.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator told us that he was speaking from the Roman Catholic point of view and I want to tell him that I believe that marriage has a God-given basis. There is no doubt about that In a Christian state marriage is based on the Bible and we must try to keep the high moral and ethical values of the union of husband and wife on such a level that one never loses that spiritual, divine character in a marriage. I want to say quite honestly, Sir, and there are gentlemen sitting in this Chamber who will agree with me when I say it, that the proof of godliness in most husbands is to be found in the sacrificial hands of their wives. We have been served for so many years by the loving hands of our wives that one sees therein the love of an allwise Father. We must never lose sight of that aspect of marriage and that is why I am pleased that the hon. Senator mentioned this aspect.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator asked questions in connection with maintenance. There is already a maintenance obligation and maintenance can summarily be imposed in a magistrate&#x2019;s court in terms of the Maintenance Act. There is a maintenance obligation. If a husband chases his wife out of the home she can go to the magistrate&#x2019;s court and in terms of certain laws she can obtain maintenance for herself and the children until such time as divorce proceedings are instituted. That is the reply to the hon. Senator&#x2019;s question.</p>
<p>I want to thank hon. gentlemen here for their co-operation. I do not know what the position will be at the Committee Stage &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman says it is not necessary for the Bill to be committed and so I can move that this stage be now taken. But if that is so, Sir, I should like to make a few remarks I made in the Other Place. Certain questions were put to me in the Other Place and I gave an undertaking that I would give consideration to possible amendments in the Senate. I want to say at once that I cannot agree to these amendments but I also want to say that I did consider these specific points of discussion and I want to mention them here.</p>
<p>In clause 7 one of the hon. members in the Other Place suggested that the word &#x201C;and&#x201D; be substituted for the word &#x201C;or&#x201D;, which, incidentally, in my opinion, would be a rather important amendment. If hon. Senators look at clause 7(1), they will note that it provides for an agreement between the parties to a divorce in respect of two matters, viz. a disbursement of the assets or the payment of maintenance. The question was put to me: What would happen if both these matters were at issue, and should it not provide for the disbursement of assets and the payment of maintenance. I referred this suggestion to the law advisers and their reply was that the courts had found that in this type of case where the word &#x201C;or&#x201D; appears, it can also be construed as &#x201C;and&#x201D;. It is really &#x201C;and/or&#x201D;. This is also confirmed by Mr. Justice Steyn in his book on the interpretation of laws.</p>
<p>Clause 9 prescribes certain factors to be taken into account by a court when considering forfeiture of patrimonial benefits. An hon. member in the Other Place motivated his proposed amendments by saying that these factors were not sufficiently comprehensive. He gave two examples. Firstly, he referred to a legacy in favour of one of the parties to the marriage during the marriage, and secondly, the assets of the parties at the time of entering into the marriage. I indicated to the hon. member that these were in fact interesting points which merited consideration, and I did consider them, but I discovered that the Law Commission had also considered them. After careful consideration of the factors they felt should be taken into account, and what they felt merited consideration, viz. how long the marriage had lasted, the circumstances leading to the break-up and any actual misconduct on the part of either of the parties, they came to the conclusion that in the circumstances the factors mentioned in the Bill are sufficient. As far as patrimonial benefits are concerned, each of the parties must in any case explicitly state what amounts each contributed to the marriage in community of property which in fact belongs to each of them, and what must be declared forfeit. After careful consideration we are of the opinion that a further amendment is not necessary here.</p>
<p>As far as clause 12 is concerned, an interesting amendment was proposed here by one of the hon. members in the Other Place, viz. that a judge should be authorized&#x2014;this refers to publication&#x2014;to decide that divorce proceedings should be held <i>in camera.</i> This would result in the judge being able to go further and decide that certain parts of the judgment too should not be published. For instance, the judge might deal with details of the divorce action in his judgment and in such a case he would also have the right to say it had been held <i>in camera</i> and nothing could be made public.</p>
<p>My attitude in the Other Place was that the Press Union had held consultations with me and I had referred the Press Union to the Law Commission. Therefore the Press Union were entitled to think that it was an implicit agreement between them and myself that I would respect whatever they might arrange with the Law Commission. Of course, I could not tell them that we could ignore a debate, but I said in the Other Place that I felt bound to go back to the Press Union if I thought this was a valid argument. Although it is an interesting argument, Sir, I feel that the Press Union and the Law Commission resolved the matter between themselves and went as far as the Law Commission felt they should go. I did not therefore approach the Press Union because I was not in favour of agreeing to the amendment. I am of the opinion that in terms of the Supreme Court Act of 1959, the court can in any case decide that any trial should be heard <i>in camera.</i> That Act is in operation and I do not think it is necessary to insert it here as well. Therefore I shall abide by what the Law Commission decided in connection with the Press Union because I do not want to interfere with their negotiations.</p>
<p>Having said that, Sir, I have also come to the end of what I promised to consider. Once again I want to thank hon. Senators for the way in which they debated this matter. This is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation to be dealt with by this Parliament for many years and I want to express the hope that it will be a successful piece of legislation. I can only say that this legislation will be operative long after most of us no longer sit in these Chambers, but hon. Senators will in any event have the satisfaction of knowing that they gave South Africa a divorce law which will serve for many years, and I hope will give good service.</p>

<p>Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity of speaking at this Third Reading stage. The hon. Senator Winchester mentioned earlier, and it also struck me, that so far the only people who have spoken on this Bill have been legal people. I think it is important that as one of the two women members of this House, as a married woman with a family and in view of certain approaches that have been made to me by several women, I should raise my voice even if I do not agree with the views expressed by some of the women who have approached me. I want to say how much I personally appreciate the stand that the hon. the Minister has taken in this matter. There are social problems connected with marriage and divorce today but this is not only so because of marriage and divorce. There are also scientific reasons.</p>
<p>In previous centuries there were three things which I think were really important to a human being, namely, birth, marriage and death. A person had no say in his birth and he had little say in his death. His say in respect of marriage has varied from time to time. In previous ages marriages were often arranged by the families of the children and some of them worked quite well. They may have worked well because at the age of puberty or adolescence it is very difficult for a young man or woman to know what he or she wants to do with his or her life. We think of our own university students of today, Sir. They are about 19, 20 and 21 but we allow them a fair amount of liberty because they are not mature, their minds are not properly formed and they are not responsible enough to take decisions that will affect them for their whole lives. I am sure many hon. Senators who have been asked to address students at universities will have made this point I personally have because I consider that they should be warned that they are not ready to take decisions that will affect them for their whole lives.</p>

<p>I think it is unfair that a decision made at the age of 19 or 20 or 21 to take someone as a partner who may perhaps be totally alien to one&#x2019;s own family&#x2014;the family has no say in the matter&#x2014;should bind those two people together for the rest of their lives. It is very, very easy to get married, Sir. When one thinks that it is not so very long ago that adulteresses were stoned one realizes how life has changed and that no matter how clever, how logical or how normal people are, when it comes to a matter between man and woman they no longer think logically. I think provision has to be made for this sort of thing because it will not help us to be smug. I do not think there is any family that does not number among its members somebody who has had a very unhappy marriage or who has been divorced.</p>
<p>Another aspect that must be borne in mind, Sir, is the fact that women are living longer these days and that they do not age as fast as they used to. In the old days women bore children, perhaps year after year after year, and by the age of 30 they were old women. Today this is all changing. Women are still young at 40; they are still young at 50. There seems to be a strange atmosphere in the world today, Sir. The children grow up and the parents still seem to have a lifetime in front of them. I think that is perhaps a reason why one finds these days that people get divorced. They think to themselves, or at least the one partner may think: &#x201C;I have done my duty; I have brought up my children; why must I stay married to this man (or woman) in my old age, with whom I have nothing in common?&#x201D; Perhaps if we made marriage more difficult there might not be so many divorces.</p>
<p>I am very sympathetic towards women who are totally unprepared for what might await them in this century, i.e. to marry, to become housewives and to have children and then perhaps to be abandoned. I read somewhere that a housewife is a person who is married to a house. Perhaps they forget that they are married to men of flesh and blood. They make wonderful mothers, they make wonderful housekeepers but perhaps they do not succeed as wives and as they find that they are abandoned through no real fault of their own at an age when they no longer have the ability to earn their own living. I know that the hon. the Minister has at all times been sympathetic towards and shown an interest in helping those women whose husbands leave them at an age of 40 or 50.</p>

<p>Well, it happens, Hon. Senators may laugh but it is going to happen to men as well. The women are going to find that they want a new life. It is important that instead of covering the whole matter with shame, we should accept it and see to it that the innocent party gets the best deal possible. I am thinking of the children in the case of a divorce, a messy divorce. Who suffers? The ones who suffer are the innocent parties, especially the children. The children are laughed at by their schoolmates; they are jeered at by their friends; they feel a stigma because their parents do not get along with one another. I do not believe in divorce; I think the hon. Senator Winchester is right; but I can assure you, Sir, that it is a fact of life and it is here to stay. Even in the early Biblical days there were ways and means according to the Old Testament whereby the husband could turn out his wife if he no longer wanted her. It is something, therefore, that has been going on for a long time.</p>
<p>I am very grateful that the Press will now not be allowed to publish the sordid details in a divorce case. If there are sordid details and they are published, one reads them, and I think that goes for most people. I think that would go for 99,9% of the hon. Senators of this House. Human beings find it interesting to find out what is going on but one should not be encouraged in this type of thing. I also know of people who have not been divorced and perhaps have desperately needed to be divorced, for their own sanity and that of their children but, because they have feared the adverse publicity, they have remained together. The husband may be an absolute brute but the wife stays with him because she does not want her children to suffer. There is also the case of a husband whose wife preferred other women. The husband became the guilty party and he had to pay out a large amount of money because he did not want the matter to come out in court for the sake of his children. I do not think that is fair.</p>
<p>Everyone of us who wants to get back at our mate in a divorce action must remember that we will have to face our own children in the next generation and it can boomerang back on us. If one feels, for instance, that one&#x2019;s husband deserves to be given a hard time because he wants to run off with another woman, one may find that in ten years&#x2019; time one has to retract one&#x2019;s words because one&#x2019;s daughter finds herself in the situation in which the girl friend of one&#x2019;s husband finds herself today. It is very involved but I believe in Solomon&#x2019;s type of justice, i.e. the same for everybody&#x2014;no revenge taken. I thank the hon. the Minister. I thank him particularly for his entire handling of this Bill, for the way in which he has done it and the way in which all hon. Senators have done it. I do not think there has been a nasty taste left anywhere. I really think that this is a good thing and I hope the same thing will happen with the new Marriage Bill and that hon. Senators will understand the position of those women who are worried about their pensions. Quite rightly so too, because they have worked with their husbands all their lives and now they find that some young floozy (or so they consider her) is going to get the pension that they worked so hard for and that is most unfair.</p>

<p>That is true. Nevertheless, I am pleased that the hon. Senator Koch took part, and I am pleased that the other hon. Senator is also present. It is important for the ladies to take note of the fact that we men realize that the fault is often ours when it comes to divorce. I am also very grateful that the hon. Senator spoke of the children of a marriage because if ever there is a tragedy, it is a marriage which breaks up in which children are involved. Over a very long period as a practising advocate I always had the feeling that once there were children there should be no divorce, because the parties who suffer in every divorce are the children. I related the instance in the Other Place in which I myself was involved and where for days on end we washed the dirty linen of the parties concerned in public. A child was involved; the wife had the child and the husband had not seen the child for six months. The child was about six years old&#x2014;I cannot remember if it was a boy or a girl. After a long argument we arranged that for the rest of the weekend, i.e. the Saturday, the child would go to the father. But the two parties were so angry with one another because they had to arrange when, where and how the child should go to the father that they then arranged that the mother would allow the child to go to the father only for a short while, viz. a Sunday afternoon. At three o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon she was supposed to hand the child over to the father at the Paul Kruger Monument in Church Square. At 3 o&#x2019;clock my wife and I had finished lunch and she suggested that we go for a short drive. When we came into the city, I suddenly remembered that my client should be getting the child from the mother on Church Square. I said to my wife: &#x201C;Let us drive around the Square. I just want to see if the hand-over does take place.&#x201D; To my amazement and sorrow I found when we got to the Square at 3 o&#x2019;clock that a crowd of people had gathered around the Paul Kruger Monument. The husband and the wife were standing there screaming at one another. He had the child by the head and she had the child by the feet, and they were having a tug-o&#x2019;-war with the child all the while screaming at one another. That brought home to me again how much more difficult it was for the children in these circumstances than any of the other parties. I am pleased therefore that the provisions of this Bill are aimed at putting the interests of the child first. In fact, this Bill goes so far as to say that if the most satisfactory and the best arrangement is not made for the children, which satisfies the court, there will be no divorce. This has placed the emphasis completely on the child, where it belongs.</p>
<p>I can tell you further, Mr. President, that when I was Deputy Minister of Social Welfare, I found to my consternation that 95% of the children in our children&#x2019;s homes or so-called orphanages, were children of broken marriages. I feel that this Bill will also bring about an improvement in the lot of the poor child who has been affected by the divorce of its parents or an unhappy home. One would like to express the hope that even though this sort of Bill is necessary these days, the time will come in South Africa when we will need to make less and less use of a divorce law. This will be an ideal situation and I think that is everybody&#x2019;s wish.</p>

<p>It gives me great pleasure as someone coming from Natal, the garden province, the best province in the Republic of South Africa, to move this motion. [Interjections.] It is well known that the University of Natal has done wonderful work and in particular that its medical school has provided a valuable service to the medical fraternity of South Africa and to the people of South Africa as a whole. I look forward to the day when this medical school will be open to all races so that it can do the work necessary to train the medical practitioners that we need so desperately in our country.</p>
<p>The Bill before us does not alter the principle for which the medical school was founded or for which the university was founded to any great extent. It is merely to provide that the university may also conduct its activities in any hospital or hospital department approved by the Medical and Dental Council or at a satellite hospital, a satellite hospital department or a clinic.</p>
<p>I think it is quite clear that it is necessary to train our medical practitioners well and that it is advisable for the medical school to be able to use the facilities of other hospitals or satellite hospitals or satellite clinics. There is no change in principle as I have said before. The use of these satellite hospitals and clinics is merely being authorized in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>I will do that, but this relates to this Bill that deals with competition.</p>
<p>The object of the Bill is to give effect to the Government&#x2019;s proposals for the substitution for the existing Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955, of new legislation. This Act has been in operation since 1955 and it has become clear that it has certain shortcomings which are complicating its implementation considerably. It has been necessary, therefore, to revise this Act in its entirety in order to bring it up to date and into line with similar legislation in other Western countries. In this way, in the following countries, either totally new legislation was framed or the existing legislation was changed drastically to provide for the prior control, if necessary, of acquisitions: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, England, Germany, Israel, Yugoslavia and Ireland. Therefore South Africa is not out of step with what has already been done in many other countries.</p>
<p>Our object with the Bill is to establish more effective legislation in the interests of the business sector as well, and especially for the preservation of the free market system, which is the cornerstone of our country&#x2019;s economic life. It has never been the intention to disrupt, through the implementation of monopoly legislation, the economic growth and progress of the country in terms of the Government&#x2019;s overall policy objectives. On the contrary, it is clear that a competition policy as envisaged in this Bill will be formulated and implemented in practice with due allowance for the country&#x2019;s broad economic policy objectives. It has always been the policy of the Government to place a high premium on the preservation of healthy competition as a very important instrument, in fact, as an important condition, for the proper functioning of the free market economic system in order to carry the country to new heights of economic development. In fact, if competition really comes into its own, if there is full competition in our national economy State interference should be restricted to a minimum.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is quite impossible to formulate a competition policy which can be implemented unchanged by all countries, because the position differs from one country to another according to the peculiar circumstances of each.</p>

<p>Neither shall we, and the Bill is in fact the best proof of that However, there are certain elements of a strong competition policy which are universally applicable and which can serve as a basis on which every country can work out its own particular policy. In the Bill which is now before the House, there is enough flexibility to formulate and implement a competition policy which may best serve the Republic&#x2019;s particular circumstances and needs.</p>
<p>In the light of changing economic conditions in South Africa, it gradually became clear that the existing Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955 (Act No. 24 of 1955), was no longer effective enough as an instrument for the regulation of the country&#x2019;s general competition policy, and that it did not make adequate provision for the preservation and promotion of healthy competition in the national economy. The need to adapt this legislation, which has been in operation since 1955, to changed circumstances, is not a new development, but has been felt for a long time. In fact, as far back as 1969, a Bill which was to make suitable amendments to this Act was introduced in the Other Place and referred to a Select Committee before Second Reading. The committee could not complete its task before Parliament was prorogued, and was consequently converted into a permanent commission, which published its report in 1971 (No. RP 40/1971).</p>
<p>†Whereas the 1969 Bill to amend Act 24 of 1955, contained comprehensive proposals for dealing with mergers, take-overs and the other forms of acquiring financial control over businesses, the commission&#x2019;s recommendation was confined to &#x201C;the control and restriction of the registration of newspapers&#x201D;. These days this is a very appropriate subject. As hon. Senators may know, these proposals were not proceeded with, so that the legislation for the regulation of monopolistic conditions being applied today, is, with the exception of a few minor amendments, still the same as that proposed 24 years ago.</p>
<p>Persistent criticism levelled at the legislation and its implementation over many years, especially the belief in several quarters that the existing provisions and the dispensation for its enforcement were inadequate, convinced the Government that the time was opportune for an entire review of the present legislation.</p>
<p>In August 1975 the Government appointed a commission to review the operation of the Act, and, more specifically, to inquire into and report upon the tendency towards the forming of economic power concentrations by merger or take-over or any other way whatsoever; the advantages and disadvantages of such power concentrations viewed from the angle of the public interest; and, lastly, the efficacy of the present Act as an instrument to ensure competition. This commission reported in March 1977, and its report was immediately made public. It is interesting to note that this report enjoyed widespread publicity and discussion.</p>
<p>The Commission of Inquiry into the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955, gave in its report a detailed account of the historical background which led to the present legislation. Although this is not the proper place to repeat this historical background, I should like to highlight only a few important aspects of it.</p>
<p>As far back as 1924, the Board of Trade and Industries was empowered by legislation to advise the Government on&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Combinations, trusts, monopolies and restraint of trade tending to the detriment of the general interest, especially by restricting production or maintaining or raising prices and the prevention thereof.</block>
<p>It is therefore apparent that the Government at that stage already realized the need to empower a body to keep a watchful eye over the tendency to economic concentration in the country&#x2019;s economy.</p>
<p>The Board of Trade and Industries did in fact receive numerous complaints, either directly or via the two departments and resolved the majority of these complaints by negotiating with the parties concerned. The Board of Trade and Industries also produced several reports, wholly or partly concerned with monopolistic conditions, restrictive trade practices and the application of the Government&#x2019;s policy regarding monopolistic tendencies in the economy. Since the promulgation of the present Act, the Board of Trade and Industries has resolved a large number of complaints without having instigated formal investigations and has also instituted about 21 formal investigations into suspected monopolistic conditions and brought out reports thereon.</p>
<p>In its report the commission of inquiry also came to the conclusion that the South African economy, as a result of its historical development, has become highly concentrated. Moreover, the market is relatively small and often there is enough room only for one industry of a kind to fully satisfy the market. This specific aspect of the country&#x2019;s market structure could, therefore, lead to more opportunities arising for the creation of monopolistic conditions. Here it is also important to note that although economic concentration has ceertain definite advantages, the disadvantages thereof could, if not properly controlled or regulated, outweigh such advantages. For this reason, therefore, it is important that provision be made in legislation of this nature for the taking of preventive action where absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>In February 1978 the Government announced its proposals in connection with the recommendations of the commission in the form of the publication of a draft Bill for general information. This was done with the specific purpose of encouraging and fostering public scrutiny and debate.</p>
<p>These proposals were, in fact, closely scrutinized by both the public and private sector. In view of the widespread interest in the draft legislation and the comprehensive representations which were received from a diversity of public as well as private sector bodies, a second draft Bill was published for general information in December 1978. The original proposals have now been altered to accommodate the comments received, to provide for technical changes, to remove anomalies or to clarify certain aspects. In fact, the Bill before the House is this second draft Bill in a slightly modified form.</p>
<p>*This brings me to certain important details of the Bill.</p>
<p>No important departure is envisaged from the existing provisions in terms of which the Act will not be implemented in such a way as to interfere with the rights conferred under certain other laws. The laws concerned are the Trade Marks Act, the Designs Act, the Patents Act, the Copyright Act, the Industrial Conciliation Act and the Marketing Act. To this list is now added the Plant Breeders&#x2019; Rights Act, 1976 (Act 15 of 1976).</p>
<p>It is important in this connection that I should emphasize that it was never the intention completely to exclude all those who enjoy rights in terms of the aforementioned laws from the scope of Act No. 24 of 1955 and of the proposed legislation. It is clear from the wording of the sections and the clauses concerned that the exemption is limited in scope and applies only to the exercise of specific rights conferred in terms of these laws. The other economic activities of the parties concerned are just as subject to the Act as those of any other body.</p>
<p>A new addition to the provision is that except in so far as criminal liability is concerned, the provisions of the Act will henceforth apply to the State as well in so far as the State is concerned with the manufacture and distribution of commodities.</p>
<p>When the Board of Trade and Industries was established in its present form in 1924 in terms of Act 33 of 1924, supervision and control of undesirable monopolistic practices was one of its functions. In 1955 there was an important development in this respect when separate legislation for the control of monopolistic conditions was passed for the first time.</p>
<p>The function of conducting the necessary investigations and recommending suitable remedial measures for the combating of such conditions was still allocated to the board, which carried out this additional responsibility under difficult circumstances and with great distinction and conscientiousness. The task of the board as the Government&#x2019;s adviser on tariff protection policy and such economic problems as are referred to it from time to time has grown phenomenally since 1924, along with the country&#x2019;s economic growth. At the same time, a need has arisen for a more sophisticated approach to competition policy, especially because of the important structural changes which have taken place in the business world over the past decade or two. This caused the Government to decide, in accordance with the unanimous recommendation of the commission, to establish a separate autonomous body to advise the Government on competition policy in the same way as the Board of Trade and Industries was able to advise it on protection policy and specific economic matters.</p>
<p>†Because this new body constitutes a further development of Government policy, I feel that a few details may be of interest to hon. Senators at this stage. Whereas the commission suggested the name &#x201C;Monopolies Board&#x201D;, the Government felt that more emphasis should be placed upon the positive aspect of its competition policy and, therefore, decided upon the name &#x201C;Competition Board&#x201D; (Afrikaans&#x2014;the Raad op Mededinging).</p>
<p>Because of the importance of the functions of the board and the nature of the investigations which will be undertaken by it, it is intended that the board should be composed of persons of the highest professional ability and integrity. In this respect I am sure that the private sector could make a valuable contribution.</p>
<p>The board shall consist of a full-time chairman and not more than four part-time members and two <i>ex-officio</i> members representing the public sector namely, the chairman of the Board of Trade and Industries and the Registrar of Financial Institutions. The reasons for these <i>ex-officio</i> members are, firstly, that the Government considers it essential to maintain the expertise on competition policy built up in the Board of Trade and Industries over many years as well as its valuable store of information on, and insight in, South Africa&#x2019;s economic structure, which it enjoys as a result of its continuous contact with all sectors of the economy. Secondly, the Department of Finance is responsible for the implementation of several statutes pertaining to the various financial institutions under its control. It is considered that in the execution of these duties, there should be co-ordination of policy in so far as these duties concern matters that may have a bearing on competition.</p>
<p>Provision is also made for the appointment of an additional member of the board for a certain period and a specific purpose.</p>
<p>The commission recommended, and I have also received requests to this effect from certain other interests, that the members of the Competition Board should be unattached, in other words, they should not be civil servants or representatives of vested interests. Although I wholeheartedly support these sentiments, I have to point out that it may not always be possible to find completely unattached persons to appoint as members of boards, especially on a part-time basis. This requirement is, therefore, not incorporated in the Act, although I would like to stress and to assure hon. Senators that it will always be Government policy to appoint, wherever possible, independent, objective and unattached persons from outside the public sector to statutory bodies of this nature.</p>
<p>As emphasized by the commission, a competition policy embraces much more than the undertaking of investigations into alleged monopolistic conditions and the supervision of prohibitions imposed in pursuance of such investigations. An important task of the Competition Board would be to advise the Minister of Economic Affairs on all aspects of economic competition policy, with due regard to the Government&#x2019;s overall economic objectives. In short, it should establish a workable relationship with and between other official bodies, Government departments and the private sector in order to co-ordinate and promote a national competition policy within the framework of other policy objectives for the country as a whole.</p>
<p>*One of the first tasks of the Competition Board will naturally be to lay down broad guidelines, for its own use, but also for general information, with regard to problems which may be experienced with acquisitions, in order to give persons or businesses which intend to effect take-overs or mergers an opportunity to ascertain whether their proposed action is in accordance with the guidelines. This policy and these guidelines will naturally be drawn up by the board in close consultation with all interest groups in the public and private sectors and will be revised from time to time.</p>
<p>I should also like to point out a few other important principles contained in the Bill.</p>
<p>Unlike the present position, the new board will have the right to undertake investigations on its own initiative and without a specific commission from the Minister of Economic Affairs. The implications of this provision are obvious and clear. It will confirm the autonomy of the Competition Board and confer upon it the necessary authority and status which we expect of such a board. But these powers will also enable the board to investigate the activities of the public as well as the private sector&#x2014;an aspect which the commission feels very strongly about and which I endorse.</p>
<p>It is clear from representations that have been received that there is considerable misunderstanding about the question of the burden of proof at investigations undertaken by the board. I want to point out from the outset that as far as investigations of restrictive practices are concerned, there is no difference in approach between the existing Act and the Bill which is now before this hon. House. In fact, the position has not changed at all, except that the term &#x201C;monopolistic condition&#x201D; is replaced in this Bill by &#x201C;restrictive practice&#x201D;.</p>
<p>It is also clear, from the reports of the Board of Trade and Industries concerning investigations it has already undertaken into undesirable practices, that in any case it gave the responsible parties sufficient opportunity, either through its questionnaires or during the hearing of verbal evidence, to show on what basis the relevant conditions for which they are responsible can be justified in the public interest. The Bill does not propose any deviation from the existing principle in this connection.</p>
<p>Another aspect to which I should like to refer is the fact that the Bill now provides for the board to investigate proposed acquisitions as well. Since acquisitions are a fairly common phenomenon in any developing economy and as such form part of business activities, it can never be presumed that such an acquisition can or should necessarily be considered contrary to the public interest. Only when the board finds, on the basis of information available to it, that there are circumstances in the light of which such acquisition or proposed acquisition is not in the public interest, it may recommend to the Minister that certain steps be taken to prevent such an acquisition or proposed acquisition.</p>
<p>The Government agrees with the commission&#x2019;s recommendation that the legislation should not contain any <i>per se</i> prohibitions of malpractices, but that the restrictions of competition which amount to <i>de facto</i> monopolistic conditions can only be declared illegal after thorough investigation by and on the recommendation of the investigating body, in accordance with the procedure which has been laid down.</p>
<p>However, it is striking that the commission has identified quite a number of well-known restrictive trade practices and that there have been representations, on the basis of the evidence that has been obtained, for a summary prohibition of some of them.</p>
<p>The wording of the Bill makes it quite clear that professions can also be investigated in terms of the legislation. Again this is not a new principle because such investigations can already be made under the existing legislation.</p>
<p>In accordance with the proposals of the commission, the Bill seeks to increase considerably the fines for offences, to serve as a deterrent. Apart from the fact that because of inflation the fines in the existing legislation are quite inadequate, there is the further consideration that the really big business enterprises which are well provided with capital will not be prevented by a small fine from continuing with illegal activities if the profits they derive from such activities are considerably higher than the maximum fine provided for in the legislation.</p>
<p>As negotiations for the termination of a monopolistic condition in terms of the existing Act can only take place after completion of this particular inquiry and after the Minister has considered the report, it is now being provided that such negotiations can take place at any time after the announcement of a particular inquiry. With this provision in the Act it is therefore envisaged that cases that have to be investigated can be dealt with more expeditiously.</p>
<p>The Competition Board will report in full to the Minister on its activities every year. As is already the case with the reports of the Board of Trade and Industries, the annual reports of the first-mentioned board will be tabled in both Houses of Parliament every year.</p>
<p>†On the question of increased concentration of economic power by merger, takeover or other means of acquiring control of another business by an existing business&#x2014; referred to as &#x201C;acquisitions&#x201D; in this Bill&#x2014; substantial changes in the existing legislation are proposed.</p>
<p>Let me state at the outset that the Government is fully aware of the fact that, by international standards, the size of the South African market is such that it does not always permit the establishment of a multitude of firms in all branches of economic activity. Consequently the Government believes that there should be no unreasonable impediment on the attainment of rationalization of the country&#x2019;s industry. In fact, it is in South Africa&#x2019;s own interest to reap the benefits of the economies of scale where justified, in order to be better equipped to meet international competition.</p>
<p>But I should also want to point out that the decision to provide for specific provisions in the legislation to deal with acquisitions does not altogether constitute a new principle. In terms of the existing Act the Government has the power to deal with the results of acquisitions on an <i>ex post facto</i> basis. What is new, is the principle introduced in the Bill to scrutinize proposed acquisitions calculated to restrict competition in a manner which is detrimental to the public interest before they take place. In this regard the guidelines to which I have referred would be of material significance to the board and also to the private sector. As in the United Kingdom, tee Minister may, if necessary, even issue a standstill order, requiring the relevant parties not to proceed with the proposed acquisition for a period of three months. This constitutes the period within which the Board has to complete its investigations and submit its findings and recommendations to the Minister.</p>
<p>The main reason for this important departure from the existing legislation is that the Government believes, as did the Commission, that it is not feasible to allow mergers and take-overs to take place in an unbridled manner, without any power to regulate or curb, if necessary, their potential effects on the structure of industry and competition.</p>
<p>The Government also took heed of the Commission&#x2019;s warning that it should not be tee intention to investigate or scrutinize in advance all acquisitions and that these new powers should be applied with the greatest circumspection, avoiding <i>per se</i> rules and <i>a priori</i> assumptions that such acquisitions are fundamentally undesirable.</p>
<p>Mention should also be made of the Commission&#x2019;s proposals for a further body, the Merger Tribunal, to conduct inquiries into acquisitions referred to it by either the Minister or the Competition Board. Hon. Senators will recollect that provision for such a body was contained in the first Draft Bill published in February 1978. This idea of a further quasi-judicial body in addition to the Competition Board, with specific functions for dealing with acquisitions, was altogether rejected by the private sector. Consequently the Government decided not to proceed with this proposal on the grounds that the special functions which could be assigned to a Merger Tribunal by the Commission could just as well be per formed by the Competition Board or the Minister.</p>
<p>*Although the principle of the protection of witnesses exists in our legal system, there are various subtle ways, the most important of which is the withholding of supplies, in which life can be made impossible for a witness in the business community, with the result that the existing protection for witnesses may be inadequate in this connection. The relevant clause which has been embodied in the Bill is therefore intended to provide protection to witnesses.</p>
<p>Mr. President, as I said at the outset, this Bill was drafted after intensive study and proper consultation. I trust it will receive the support of all hon. Senators.</p>
<p>I intend moving an amendment to clause 9 which will read as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On page 12, in line 50, after &#x201C;Act&#x201D; to insert:<br/>in relation to a specific alleged restrictive practice or an acquisition.</block>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister and I have often crossed swords across the floor of this House in the past but we have also often agreed. However, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that when he moves the Second Reading of a Bill, even if it is as lengthy as this one, it is not necessary for him to be in such a hurry in this hon. House. We who serve in this hon. House have already learnt, as a result of the years we have spent here, that one year can be like one day and a thousand years like one year. It is not necessary for the hon. the Minister, therefore, to be in a hurry when he comes to this House with legislation of this nature.</p>
</speech>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>No, Mr. President, you need not worry; in the case of legislation of this nature I shall never ask for the privilege of a thousand years. [Interjections.] I say this especially in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister probably realized before he came to this hon. House that this was not contentious legislation. Apart from that, this legislation is in fact self-explanatory. This is not the shortest bill that we have dealt with in this House. The hon. the Minister has pointed out that this legislation is based on comprehensive investigation and the report of a commission but I want to point out that in spite of comprehensive investigations and commission reports it still rests with the law advisers to draft legislation of this nature in terms as clear as those in which this has been drafted. I think that as a representative of the official Opposition I should be failing in my duty if I did not express my appreciation for the clear way in which this legislation has been drafted. Having said that I want to add that I do not differ from the hon. the Minister as far as the principle of the legislation or the provisions of the various clauses are concerned. We as the Official Opposition therefore will have no objection if the hon. the Minister does not want to have the Bill committed. I realize, of course, that the hon. the Minister himself intends moving an amendment during the Committee Stage.</p>
<p>I think we in this House should have clarity in respect of certain principles because it is often held against the NRP for agreeing with the Government in regard to certain legislation. Therefore I want to investigate the principles underlying this legislation as far as the attitude of my Party is concerned.</p>
<p>In the first instance, the New Republic Party is of course in favour of a minimum amount of State interference in our economy. We have stated that quite clearly on numerous occasions. Because we are in favour of that, we are at the same time in favour of a system under which free enterprise should be given as much free rein as possible; in other words, competition should be allowed as much as possible. If factors in our economy team up to create monopolies, influences are generated that thwart free enterprise. In these circumstances, i.e. where free enterprise is thwarted because of monopolies, we welcome State intervention either to put an end to monopolies or to prevent them. I am pleased to see, therefore, that the word &#x201C;competition&#x201D; is used in this Bill. If there is not healthy competition a free economy will not be able to function properly.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has referred to structural changes in the economy. The economy in South Africa has not yet reached the stage of development that it has reached in certain European countries and, because we find ourselves continually in a state of development, we shall in future continue to experience changes in this respect. In future, therefore, legislation of this nature will only be of a consequential nature and the necessary changes will be effected in order to meet the requirements of the day and the position in which the legislators find themselves and in order to contend with the structural development to which the hon. the Minister has referred.</p>
<p>There are certain aspects in this legislation that we welcome particularly. The hon. the Minister has said that two <i>ex officio</i> members from the public sector will serve on this board. I agree with the hon. the Minister that we need these two members in these times. Without going any further into the matter, I just want to say that I believe that if the members to be appointed or nominated to the board by the hon. the Minister have the necessary professional knowledge, they will render valuable service. I trust also that when the day comes the hon. the Minister will consider reducing the number of <i>ex officio</i> members from the public sector on the board. I believe that they&#x2014;the other members&#x2014;will gradually acquire an understanding of the objectives aimed at and that they will equip themselves in those respects so that there will eventually be a fully representative body that will represent free competition in the private sector.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has said that the board will co-ordinate and promote a policy of healthy competition. The board will also draw up guidelines in respect of policy for general information. I believe that in the past, in spite of our efforts and experience, especially as far as guidelines in respect of policy for general information are concerned, we have not been too successful. It is very important for the future development of our country that we do that, particularly when one bears in mind the tremendous demands that will be made of our economy within the next 20 years up to the end of the century. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that we plan for the future and that guidelines be laid down, either by the Government or somebody else, for the economists and entrepreneurs to follow. Then they will know in what direction they are moving and they will not be fumbling in the dark.</p>
<p>In the final instance the board will be autonomous and will act independently of the Minister. I regard that as a magnanimous gesture. This is good legislation, Sir, and I do not think we can have better legislation at this stage of our history as far as our economy is concerned. There are always people who say they can improve on this or that, but I am not talking about the details of this legislation. I am talking about the broad principles contained in it.</p>
<p>In conclusion I want to say to the hon. the Minister that economically this legislation will be a great blessing to us in future. We in South Africa are very prone to argue about less important matters and there is always, for example, a spirit of competition between the commercial sector and the industrial sector. What suits the one is not suitable for the other. However, broad guidelines are laid down in this legislation to cater for every sector and I believe when we look at this legislation in its true perspective that those who follow us will say one day that this was legislation that was really to our advantage. The hon. the Minister has proudly quoted today from legislation of the year 1924 that has served us as a guide. We also have the legislation of 1955 whose guidelines we have been following up to today. I believe that the legislation we are discussing today will serve the same purpose and that it will be a blessing to us economically.</p>

<speech by="#visser">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we want to express our appreciation to the official Opposition, especially to the hon. Senator Swanepoel, for supporting and appreciating this good legislation of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>I may add that the success of this measure will greatly depend on the board that is to be appointed by the hon. the Minister. If the composition of the board is the correct one and if the approach of the board is to limit interference to the minimum, i.e. to intervene only where it is essential, we shall be successful. I think it should be a condition that the board will only intervene where it is essential to do so. Interference can be either good or bad and, as it is, businessmen are already complaining that there is too much interference on the part of the State. They are complaining about that and sometimes justifiably so. It is a fact that they have to contend with many factors introduced by the State. This legislation is essential in order to protect our system of private enterprise against its own weaknesses. Our private enterprise system does not contain advantages only; it also has disadvantages and those disadvantages are mainly to be found in the abuse of economic power when the private enterprise system has that power. And when private enterprise abuse that power, Sir, it abuses it to the detriment of the public and to the detriment of the country. That is why I believe that private enterprise should be protected against its own weaknesses in the interests of the country. And for that reason private businessmen will also regard this legislation as desirable and as essential. Once again I want to emphasize the importance of efficiency. We have in the past often referred to the success that West Germany has achieved and, on the last occasion, I said that one of the reasons for their great success in international trade was their efficiency. But there is another reason as well which is of importance and I want to quote from a book from which I quoted on a previous occasion, namely <i>The Roots of Inflation in West Germany.</i> They say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The question arises as to whether it may be the higher rate of economic competition in itself which explains why Germany has been more successful on the world market than most other nations.</block>
<p>Strong competition has been the main reason why Germany has been so very successful in exporting her products <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the world. Let us have a look at the South African situation. I have here an article written by Dr. P. G. du Plessis, senior lecturer at the University of Stellenbosch. He wrote this article in September 1978 in the <i>SA. Journal of Economics.</i> He draws the following conclusions after having disclosed certain statistics&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">All the measures of concentration discussed in this paper indicate that economic power in South African manufacturing is highly concentrated. Awareness of a high degree of concentration in any particular industry or in the economy as a whole should be a matter of concern to those responsible for maintaining and enhancing free and fair competition.</block>
<p>He concludes with the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Should the present situation be allowed to continue unabated the South African economy may in due course be dominated by Government enterprises on the one hand and only a very few large conglomerates on the other.</block>
<p>Well, those are the facts, Sir, and as is apparent from this the hon. the Minister should long since have instructed his board to go into this important matter.</p>
<p>Before I sit down I want to refer to one other aspect The importance of this is proved also by other information and we often have to compare our position with that of the rest of the world. One has no option because it is a good yardstick, in fact, to compare oneself with others. One person is weighed against another person; one country is weighed against another country; one industry is weighed against another industry and I want to give an example. Our manufacturing industry in South Africa is doing excellent work and that is of very great importance to South Africa. In my humble opinion I think any assistance that the Government can give to the manufacturing industry, in whatever form it may be, will be fully justified. As a matter of fact, I am sure that if the Government could afford it, it would like to give much more.</p>
<p>We must remember that the manufacturing industry in South Africa enjoys one important privilege which other sectors do not enjoy, and that is that over and above the assistance it gets, it is also protected against overseas competition by way of import tariffs. That protection is essential; we welcome it and we must not underestimate the value of that protection because it can lead to a concentration of economic power. And if that economic power is abused, it may be to the detriment of South Africa and the public.</p>
<p>In passing I just want to mention two figures to the hon. the Minister. I know the hon. the Minister attaches a great deal of value to this yardstick, namely &#x201C;the number of working hours needed to purchase something&#x201D;. A study was made in Switzerland of &#x201C;Prices and Earnings around the Globe&#x201D;. It covered various sectors as, for example, the manufacturing industry and agriculture&#x2014;mainly the various facets of these two sectors&#x2014;and the figures in this respect are interesting. They are expressed in terms of &#x201C;the number of working hours needed to purchase the goods and services listed below&#x201D;. That is their yardstick. They deal with the manufacturing industry and show South Africa&#x2019;s position in the field of men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s clothing which from the nature of things constitutes an important factor in the expenses of every person. Out of 41 countries South Africa is 21st in relation to clothing prices; in other words, South Africa is just above average; it is slightly more expensive that the average which is between 20 and 21. That is a good comparison. If one is average it means that one is not too expensive and from the nature of things one is not too cheap either. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me.</p>
<p>I want to give the comparative figure in respect of another industry that does not enjoy protection, where there is also very strong competition and where other factors play a role as well, namely the food industry. This is also expressed in the same terms, namely &#x201C;Number of working hours needed to purchase a food basket&#x201D; and this food basket contains 38 items. In that case South Africa is the twelth cheapest out of 41 countries in the world. The conclusion one can draw from that, therefore&#x2014;and I think you will agree with me when I say this, Sir&#x2014;is that as far as food is concerned, we are in fact, in a very fortunate position here in South Africa.</p>

<p>That is the position as expressed in terms of purchasing power which is in fact the yardstick of one&#x2019;s standard of living. That is an additional factor. But when one talks about competition and one relates one&#x2019;s purchasing power to the manufacturing industry and the food industry&#x2014;as long as one applies the same yardstick&#x2014;one finds that one has a perfect comparison, i.e. one is comparing comparable things.</p>
<p>Firstly, Sir, I take my hat off to our agricultural industry&#x2014;I think everyone in South Africa should do so&#x2014;for what it is doing to provide the people with cheap and wholesome food.</p>

<p>Secondly, Sir, we should also express our appreciation to the manufacturing industry which in spite of certain disadvantages&#x2014;because we still have to import many goods at a high price&#x2014;has maintained an average price and is not one of the highest in the world.</p>
<p>I want to conclude, Sir, by saying that we have the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and the Department of Industry. We seldom talk about these two departments. I want to avail myself of the opportunity today to express our appreciation for the outstanding work they are doing. I want to thank the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Mr. Tjaart van der Walt, for the part that he plays in assisting the distribution industry and the South African people. Together with the hon. the Minister he keeps a watchful eye on the situation.</p>
<p>At the same time I also wish to express appreciation to Mr. Theron, the Secretary of the Department of Industry, and his staff. This department is an extremely important branch of our national economy. They are often present in this hon. House and, as we do not often discuss this matter, I wish to express my appreciation today to the Board of Trade and Industries. I had a great deal to do with the board in earlier days and I do not think hon. Senators and the public outside realize what valuable work that board is doing in connection with the economic development of South Africa, with special reference to our industrial development. It is an exceptionally efficient board. At the moment the board is under the leadership of Dr. Clue, if I remember correctly. When one looks at their reports, one finds that generally speaking the way they have been drawn up always bears the hallmark of efficiency. We extend our sincere gratitude to them and wish them everything of the best for the future.</p>
<p>I come now to the hon. the Minister&#x2014; last but not least&#x2014;and I think South Africa is fortunate &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. President, I enjoyed the hon. Senator Dr. Visser&#x2019;s speech, except the last part I did not enjoy the last part at all. I think he spoilt his speech. I wonder the hon. the Minister did not blush because of the nice things that Dr. Visser said about him. At the beginning of his speech, the hon. Senator spoke like a scientist but towards the end he was speaking like a good Nationalist praising a Minister. That is what all those hon. Senators do at the end of their speeches. That seems to be the custom. I do not want to take anything away from the earlier part of his speech; I found it most interesting and instructive. When the hon. Senator talks on matters of finance.

I want to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister some of the people whom I do not think deserve praise in this matter. But before I go any further, I want to say that I support this legislation. As in the case of all legislation there is criticism and, as I have often said in this House, I am like Oliver Twist: No matter what the hon. the Minister comes along with, I shall ask for more if I think it will be to the benefit of the public. I am one of those who believes that the greatest monopoly in South Africa is the Nationalist Government itself. They are the biggest culprits in matters of this sort They control almost everything one can think of and what they do not control they tax to high heaven anyway. So the biggest monopolist in this country is certainly the Government Just look at the title of this Bill, Sir&#x2014;&#x201C;Maintenance and Promotion of Competition Bill.&#x201D; One could apply that to the Nationalist Party. I think they should allow more competition in South Africa, more political competition, but they are even trying to get a monopoly of politics in this country. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I do not think he can know all that bull by heart.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I am not taking anything away from the hon. the Minister this afternoon. I do not want to fight or argue with him. But what I do want to say to him, Sir, is that we have had this type of legislation, as he says, on the Statute Book for some time; this is just smartening it up, which he believes and which I think most people believe is necessary. But in spite of the fact that we have had these restrictions on monopolies in some form or another by legislation, they have nevertheless taken place over the years. I hope that this new Bill will slow down this type of monopolistic practice that has been increasing. The hon. the Minister will remember and I think every hon. Senator will remember the little grocer shop at the corner in the olden days where one got service and politeness. It was like a family business. That little corner shop was a credit to every community; one used to go there for a loaf of bread or something of that nature. [Interjections.] Even the corner pub served a very useful purpose, Sir. But these have gradually gone out of existence. The competition from supermarkets has proved too great and these supermarkets have been and are being established in all the suburbs of the country. My hon. friend in front of me turns round; he is a little concerned about the supermarket in which he has an interest. However, his is miles away from anywhere; I am not even quite sure whether it is in the Republic of South Africa or in kwaZulu. I am not having a go at his supermarket. As a patron of these little corner shops I miss their going. Society operated a little differently in those days. Now they are being replaced by big supermarkets. I am old enough to remember, and I also know a little history in this regard, that the nations of the world, Great Britain in particular, were built up on their small businesses. Great Britain was called a nation of shopkeepers and that was in fact what made England great There were hundreds of thousands of little businesses instead of half a dozen large conglomerates of big businesses. The hon. Senator Dr. Visser said that if we went on in the way we are going, all businesses will eventually fall into the hands of just two or three big conglomerates in South Africa and the small business will disappear. Not only would this be a tragedy for the customers of these businesses, it would also be bad from an economic point of view&#x2014;and I am no economist&#x2014;because if you hurt one of these big businesses, you hurt the country whereas if a small business goes under, it only affects the local community.</p>
<p>Let me give the hon. the Minister an example of what I mean. I make no bones about it. I have never claimed to be an expert on this subject. I see it merely from the small man&#x2019;s point of view. I gain the impression, as I think most people in South Africa do, that much of our big business in South Africa goes around in circles. Take the financial institutions. They seem to operate in a circle, a tightly-knit circle. The bank lends money to a building society, the building society lends the money to another association and it is simply a question of going around in circles. If one of those institutions gets hurt financially then a whole empire is placed in danger as a result. I do not want to mention names; one could very easily do so. As I have said, however&#x2014;the hon. the Minister can think about it far better than I&#x2014;the building society that is attached to an insurance company lends its funds to a particular bank, and that bank lends that money back to the insurance company and so on. It just goes around in a circle all the time. What frightens me and frightens me very much, is that if one of these bodies gets into financial difficulties, then the whole of that particular empire is seriously endangered and the whole economy of South Africa could be seriously placed in jeopardy. I am very concerned about that type of monopoly. That is why I must support this sort of legislation.</p>
<p>I should also like to draw to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention this sort of practice. Again I do not want to mention names, but it is well known that the brick industry of South Africa is largely in the hands of one or two very large companies. They do a very good job and they may produce bricks at a lower figure than the smaller brick companies can. However, I have had the experience of somebody complaining to me that when he was building a house one of the representatives of a particular brick company appeared on the scene and said: &#x201C;I see you are just ready to order the tiles for the roof.&#x201D; And he answered: &#x201C;Yes, but I am not ordering the tiles from you, because I can get a particular colour tile which I would like for my roof from another small company a few miles out of town.&#x201D; He was immediately informed by the brick company, which is a very large one, that in future he should get the balance of his bricks from that particular company as well. That is a monopoly which I think is distasteful. I think it is completely wrong. That is the sort of thing that may not be controlled by this legislation but which I believe does extreme harm to the economy of South Africa. This is the sort of thing I certainly would like to see stopped. Therefore, while I welcome this legislation, there are matters, as I have said, which need attention.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser had a long list of people whom he sought to praise and probably some of them deserve praise. I am not saying that he praised them without any justification.</p>

<speech by="#dempsey">

<p>Are you still on that subject?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, and I will be coming back to it again. If I can think of something to say about that the hon. Senator represents, I will say it too. I am talking about the hon. Senator Dr. Visser praising certain people and I am not quarrelling with that. The Chambers of Commerce and the Chambers of Industry do deserve a certain amount of praise. However, I will give the hon. the Minister an example where I do not believe they deserve praise and where they in fact have harmed industry or commerce in South Africa.</p>
<p>We had the experience in Durban just recently where the president of the local Chamber of Commerce talked about opening the central business district of Durban to all traders. This is a matter which the Government is tending to promote due to the Riekert and Wiehahn Commissions reports, and they are very welcome. Not more than four or five years ago, however, when I spoke to members of this association, pleading for the same thing, they turned it down. Now they are in favour but they are only in favour because the business district of Durban, the CBD, is in fact dying.</p>
<p>This is common knowledge. I think it is probably not only the CBD of Durban but also those of many cities all over the world that are experiencing the same problem&#x2014; that the businesses are moving away from the centre of the city. The cities are dying business-wise. Now the local Chamber of Commerce has supported the idea of opening up the area for trade by the Indians in Durban. I think this is morally wrong. They do so now because business is bad. They would never have done so if business had been good. In other words, they have double standards. If business is good they do not need any help from anybody. If business is bad, then they change and they welcome other people to help business to prosper. I am not saying that this Bill has anything to do with improving matters of that particular nature. What I am saying to the hon. the Minister is that I hope that when amalgamations are considered the hon. the Minister and the body investigating this matter will bear in mind that 99 times out of 100 the excuse for these amalgamations has always been the more realistic financial approach, the more realistic costing approach. We are told that if A and B companies amalgamate the prices of the goods will probably come down. There will be a more realistic approach to costs, etc. However, in almost every instance where there has been a monopoly formed through amalgamations the prices have in fact gone up. The prices never seem to come down. This excuse, therefore, that if we amalgamate two companies, we bring the prices down, does not hold water. The prices increase. What happens to the public is that one source of the article is removed and the competition in respect of that particular article tends to disappear.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to say finally to the hon. the Minister that I welcome this legislation but I hope that he will apply it in such a way that he looks at these small things, at the small man who has suffered very grievously because of these big combines that have been formed.</p>
<p>I hope too that he looks very closely at the degree of interference, the degree of Government competition in this field alone. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the biggest monopolist I know in almost any field of activity in South Africa, happens to be the Government itself, against which nobody can compete. I hope that these are matters which the hon. the Minister will apply his mind to.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Swanepoel and the hon. Senator Dr. Visser have outlined in detail the positive aspects of the legislation before us. But I want to compliment the Government on having advertised the draft Bill for comment by the private sector. I think this enabled the Government to come forward with a measure that has been so widely acclaimed. I hope that this policy will be continued with in the future.</p>
<p>The measure before us, of course, ties on to the anti-monopolies Act which we had in the past and I think it is going to have a terrific impact on conditional selling and other restrictive measures in the future. I think it is this question of conditional selling that the hon. Senator Winchester was speaking about earlier.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Winchester also referred to the dying of the central business districts in the various towns and I think one of the reasons for this has been the competition caused by monopolies. In my view this has caused or is causing the death of the central business districts. The legislation before us may therefore well help to revive those central business districts. Having said that, Sir, and endorsing what the hon. Senator Swanepoel has said about the thoroughness of the legislation before us, I would like to put a question or a submission to the hon. the Minister.</p>
<p>In the Other Place the hon. the Minister accepted an amendment that stated that any documents or letters between a businessman and his attorney should be considered as privileged and could not be taken and used. I do submit, and want to put it to the hon. the Minister very forcibly, that there is also privity of contract between the owner of a business and his auditor, and possibly considerably more privity between an auditor and a businessman than there is between a businessman and his attorney. I feel that that privilege should also be protected in terms of this and any other legislation because it is often the auditor&#x2019;s duty to probe and probe very deeply into the business affairs of his client so that he can protect the interests of all the shareholders. In my view there is a great need for protection and privilege in regard to documents and the records of a client in the hands of his auditor. I would like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s viewpoint on that.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, as one who is perhaps more directly involved by this legislation than anybody else in this House, I must say that I welcome this legislation. I believe that as a consolidating measure it can only benefit business as a whole throughout the Republic. We have heard extremely good contributions from other hon. Senators this afternoon and I do not want to waste the time of this hon. House for too long. I rise simply in an attempt to obviate a debate during the Committee Stage on a detailed account contained in the legislation before us.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Winchester spoke about the small businessman, about the small supermarkets and about competition, and the hon. Senator Dr. Visser made the point very well that strong competition is the reason for economic strength But, Sir, when one is directly involved in the hurly-burly of business, and when one as a small fish finds himself confronted by competition from a large chain or a large fish, if I may put it that way, then that small man has to take certain evasive or protective action.</p>
<p>In the supermarket business&#x2014;and I have declared my interest&#x2014;the situation arose some years ago where small businessmen found themselves in precisely that situation, particularly in and around the larger centres of the Republic. Because of the situation in which they found themselves, they banded together into voluntary organizations; they became voluntary buying organizations. Membership of these organizations was voluntary, maintenance of prices was not practised and certain suggested prices were used or given out to members. But because of the collective power of negotiation&#x2014;&#x201C;die bedingings-mag&#x201D;&#x2014;that these organizations had to offer, they decided to band together. One of these organizations was started on the South Coast of Durban by a very famous trader of those days, but it has died out. But the principle has been continued up to today, and today we still have the voluntary chains operating.</p>
<p>In terms of the constitutions of these voluntary chains&#x2014;and there are a number of them&#x2014;the members are totally independent. They are not compelled to buy a single item from the distribution centre. They get together for the buying benefit that their organization affords them, and this of course is passed on to the buying public. I believe that this is an extremely good development in our economic life because it is all very well for the large chain stores to advertise that their products are cheaper than anybody else&#x2019;s and, in fact, to advertise prices that are cheaper than most others; to say that because of their competitive strength and because they are able to buy at a cheaper rate and are therefore able to sell at a cheaper price, they should collar the largest share of the market. It is all very well for them to say that but I believe that it is not true. I believe that their claims are not true. And the hon. the Minister will be aware of the fact that over the past few months a survey that was undertaken has shown that those large chain stores in fact have less than 40% of the market when it comes to foodstuffs.</p>
<p>These chain stores also&#x2014;and I am sure the hon. the Minister is aware of this fact&#x2014; serve a very limited market, limited to their areas, apart from the fact that they have only 40% of the buying power of the public. But what concerns me&#x2014;and that is why I wish to discuss the matter with the hon. the Minister&#x2014;is the position of the small traders who have banded together into a buying organization. Those small traders, Sir, have an equal share of the market to that which is held by the large chain stores. A small residue of approximately 20% is made up by the true independants, if I may term them such, those who have no association with any other organization. But it is that other 40% that I am concerned with because in clause 1 of the Bill, under the definition of &#x201C;restrictive practice&#x201D;, we read&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">(b) any business practice or method of trading, including any method of fixing prices, whether by the supplier of any commodity or otherwise; &#x2026; which by directly or indirectly restricting competition, has or is calculated to have the effect of&#x2014;<br/>(iii) enhancing or maintaining the price of any commodity;</block>
<p>Within these voluntary chains one has the situation where the distribution centre will periodically issue a list of suggested retail prices. And I want to stress to the hon. the Minister &#x201C;Suggested retail prices&#x201D;. There is no compulsion whatsoever on the trader to abide by those prices. He may sell the commodity for more or he may sell it for less. The advertisements which are placed in the news media will contain the advertised price and it is, of course, in the interests of the business concerned to sell at the advertised price. But I stress the point that there is no compulsion whatsoever.</p>
<p>I believe that many of these independent traders today would like an assurance from the hon. the Minister that this provision is not going to be construed in such a way that it will affect their operation through what is in effect a co-operative movement. I want to stress that the function of the distribution centre is primarily that of buying. Because they can buy in bulk they can negotiate with suppliers on a par with the large chain stores. Because they are able to distribute in bulk their distribution costs are lower. From my own experience and that of many hundreds of traders throughout this country we have found that through association with such a voluntary buying organization we have been able to provide a service to the public at prices much lower than we would have been able to do had we not been associated with this bulk buying and the advantages which pertain to it.</p>
<p>I agree with the hon. Senator Winchester that it is absolutely essential that we maintain the independent trader in our free enterprise system. We cannot afford to allow one section of our economy to fall into the hands of a consortium, individual enterprise or whatever it may be, where we will have monopolistic conditions. Wherever this has happened we have had nothing but the escalation of prices. With all respect to my colleague, the hon. Senator Du Toit, we have an example of this in the agricultural sector. The egg industry has organized itself not into a series of cooperatives but into one co-operative organization which covers the whole country. Because of this, monopolistic conditions have been created and, as a result, we have the situation today where the producer complains that he is being forced to produce at an uneconomic price, where the consumer complains that she is being forced to pay an uneconomic price and where there is a surplus production which costs the country nearly R9 million to get rid of. That is the kind of monopoly which is established immediately you allow one organization, whatever it might be, to control the production and marketing of a commodity.</p>
<p>I believe this Bill is a move in the right direction. It provides tremendous protection for the small man, but there is that one fear which many hundreds of traders have in this country today, those who are banded together into a buying organization. I hope to obtain reassurance from the hon. the Minister for those traders this afternoon.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-economic-affairs">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, in the first place I want to apologize to hon. Senators because apparently I read my Second Reading speech so fast that it was beyond the ability of some hon. Senators who listened to it to grasp what I was saying. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I appreciate the support of hon. Senators for this legislation and I do not intend repeating their speeches. However, I shall deal with some basic remarks made by hon. Senators in their speeches.</p>
<p>I think everyone realizes that what we are in fact dealing with in this legislation is, in the first place, to establish and to maintain a specific economic system in this country. One of the most important factors in order to attain that objective is proper competition. There is no doubt that competition is our important if not the deciding factor, in the maintenance of a free market system based on the profit motive. There must be no doubt about that. The second important principle contained in this legislation is that it places no prohibition <i>per se</i> on any activity, except in given circumstances. That is why the task of the Competition Board will, in fact, be to formulate a competition policy in specific circumstances in the country.</p>
<p>The third most important principle that I want to emphasize, is not whether there is a monopolistic situation but whether, if it does exist, it is harmful to the public interest It is a well-known fact that we have a limited market in South Africa and that <i>very</i> often, as far as the industrial sector is concerned, there is room for not more than one manufacturer if the cost structure is to be kept low. In other words, we think the approach should be that in the final instance and for the purposes of formulating a competition policy, the one deciding factor should be what is in the public interest. I think hon. Senators have grasped that principle.</p>
<p>The other point I want to make is that for the first time an important new principle is contained in this legislation, namely that the State has to subject itself to an investigation by the Competition Board to determine whether or not it is guilty of competing with the private sector. That applies to the activities of the State just as much as it applies to the activities of other sectors. I think this gives practical effect to the attitude the State has adopted in its theory and in the formulation of its philosophy, namely, that as far as this specific aspect of our economy is concerned, it is prepared to have its activities tested by the Competition Board, a provision which did not apply to the State in the past</p>
<p>Another important principle is that over the years and in accordance with existing legislation legal provision has existed whereby an existing set of circumstances could be examined and, if a practice was found to be undesirable, it could be tested against that legislation. It could be stopped. However, in the business world as in any other field, prevention is often better than having to apply measures to combat a practice that is already taking place. I think the important task of this Competition Board will be to formulate guidelines, based on experience, that will give an indication to the private sector whether or not a certain amalgamation or take-over is desirable. That is what is important and in that respect the hon. Senator is quite right.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator also referred to a principle which I endorse, namely, the responsibility of the State towards the economy. He said that intervention on the part of the State should be limited to the minimum. The State intervenes in the private sector as a result of certain circumstances. It intervenes, in the first instance, when the private sector asks for it Hon. Senators know how often the State is asked in this hon. House to intervene in specific circumstances in the private sector. In the second instance, the State intervenes in the affairs of the private sector when it is forced to do so in cases where the private sector does not observe the normal codes of ethics that society demands of it in order to maintain a system to which society will subscribe. In the third instance, the State has to intervene in the private sector when, strategically speaking, it is in the interests of the country and particularly when the private sector, owing to its large capital investment in any project and owing to the long period that it often takes to make any profit, if at all, is unable to fulfil certain functions.</p>
<p>Another obligation rests on the State to intervene in the economy of the country. It is common knowledge&#x2014;whether we want to admit it or not&#x2014;that people from various levels of the nation are active in the economic life of the country in various ways and at various levels. Some population groups in this country lack the ability to compete on an equal footing with others. The State has a duty, therefore, to step in when the bargaining power of the one population group is weaker than that of the other. One can only talk about fair competition when the competing parties are in an equally strong position as far as their bargaining power is concerned. That is why the State often has to take steps to promote the economic position of a specific group by means of positive action. The State does so by establishing certain corporations in order to encourage the participation of certain population groups in the economic life of the country. I do not want to deal with this aspect at length. Nobody can doubt that it is essential that corrective action in this specific connection has to come from the State. That is why I want to reiterate that it is important for hon. Senators to realize that our policy in respect of these aspects cannot be static but that, whilst its objectives remain the same, it can be changed from time to time.</p>
<p>I want to refer to another important facet One must also realize that under our system and in our present-day society itself inequality becomes more marked as efforts are made to make unequal things equal. Equality of opportunity has a specific meaning too, and that is the question of whether the person who is to avail himself of that opportunity is capable of doing so or whether he is suffering from a disadvantage that has to be remedied. Hon. Senators will agree with me as far as that is concerned because it is true. It is true, and the hon. Senator Dr. Visser also made the point when he spoke about minimum State intervention. I want to repeat that I do not intend repeating what hon. Senators have said in their speeches. However, I shall refer to certain extracts from those speeches which relate to the legislation before us.</p>
<p>I can tell hon. Senators that I keep a very close and analytical eye on those activities of the State that fall under my department, activities that can be of benefit to the private sector or, at least, activities in which they can participate. There must be no doubt about my attitude in this connection. In point of fact, for the first time the Government has decided to allow the private sector to participate in a very big undertaking, namely Sasol. Within the next few months we shall be approaching the public in regard to the financing of Sasol. The company is going to ask for listing on the Stock Exchange and the private sector will be invited to apply for shares in Sasol. I trust that the private sector will in this specific regard do in practice what they have been asking me to allow them to do in theory. You know, talk is cheap, but it is money that buys the whisky. I think we should for a change put our money where our mouths are and the private sector will have its chance to do so. There is something else I want to say in this connection, Sir, and I hope you will forgive me for doing so. Apart from the fact that we have taken a certain line in the past in respect of participation by the private sector in activities that have for very good reasons been reserved solely for State operation, we shall have to realize that in respect of the commodities Sasol will manufacture, South Africa, like other countries in the world, will find herself in a problem situation. We shall have to realize too that as far as the saving of liquid fuel is concerned, the public will have to be encouraged, on the one hand, to play a role in the production of this product and, on the other hand, to be prepared to use it sparingly. South Africa&#x2019;s prosperity depends on that.</p>
<p>I want to associate myself with what the hon. Senator Dr. Visser has said today about the outstanding work that is being done by the departments that fall under my portfolio. I want to refer more specifically to the Board of Trade and Industries. I wonder whether hon. Senators realize the extent to which the Board of Trade and Industries has contributed to the wider scope of the industrial development in this country in particular. I wonder whether hon. Senators realize the extent to which the wise policy of extending our own industrial structure in the country by tariff protection and other methods has been responsible for the fact that in a dangerous world South Africa has become more self-sufficient than it would otherwise have been. That is why I say that in our economic planning we should as far as possible observe the economic laws. On the one hand it would be unwise in respect of economic strategy not to cast our strategic thoughts over a much broader spectrum. Engines are going to be built at Atlantis. Let us not have any illusions about that. In the normal course of events that is not something we would have undertaken as a high economic priority. However, the circumstances in which we live today give a new meaning to what is of economic and strategic importance to the country. All of us have to make our contribution in that respect. I am waiting for the private sector to show that it is prepared to do its share in the manufacture of diesel engines. The hon. Senator has referred to the protection that our industries enjoy and I agree with him that that is right.</p>
<p>†I come now to the hon. Senator Winchester. He has missed the essence of the Bill. The essence of the Bill is that if you have to compete, you have to be effective. If you are effective, you have something that other people want. Due to the fact that the people do not support his party, my party has become the monopolistic institution. This was as a result of the fact that they could not withstand the competition. Secondly, he has misunderstood another concept in this Bill. That is that a monopolistic condition is only wrong when it is against the public interest. Nobody can accuse this Government of acting against the public interest [Interjections.]</p>
<p>*That is the essence of the principle that we want to protect here, namely, to promote competition. However, the idea is not to protect weaklings in the process. The hon. Senator will certainly understand that He will understand too that as a result of continually increasing competition his political life is limited unless he can produce another product that will appeal to the public. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>The hon. Senator referred to the small businessman. I agree with what he said.</p>

<p>I am not quarrelling with the hon. Senator. I merely want to tell him that the day he is right, it will be purely by chance and not because of his mental processes. However, I agree with him that the small businessman occupies a particular place in our society. As a matter of fact, I have often wondered, when we ask foreign investors to invest in our industries, whether we should not rather move away from heavy capital investment and move more towards smaller industries such as those of Western Europe. In the first instance they will act as a training school for business people here. In the second instance, it is equally important to know that if the other population groups in our country have, in fact, to take part in our economic life, i.e. in commerce and industry, they will of necessity have to start at the level of the small businessman. That is why I subscribe to the idea of the small businessman as part of our economic life. However, I am afraid that we are not always able to assess the role that the small businessman is capable of playing. What role should the State play in this specific connection? In the first instance the State assists in financing the Advisory Bureau for Small Business Undertakings at Potchefstroom. The State contributes an amount of R242 000. The IDC has established a section that can assist the small industrialist as opposed to the dealer. In the third instance, the Coloured Development Corporation was established with the idea of assisting that population group with its problems and to establish it in the small business world. The same thing happened in the case of the Indian Development Corporation. It filled a gap in the Indian community not only in respect of their participation in commerce but their participation in industry as well. And that was done very successfully. Thus we have the various corporations by means of which the State is doing its duty to assist in equalizing what has not yet been equalized in terms of the concept of competition in the business world.</p>
<p>According to the latest figures there were 52 149 small commercial undertakings in South Africa as at that date. That number was made up as follows: 33 417 one-man businesses, 3 663 partnerships and 11 631 private companies. These groups are regarded as small undertakings by the Advisory Bureau for Small Business Undertakings. Sir, do you know what their total turnover was for that specific year? It was R3 715 million. The Advisory Bureau estimates that these small business undertakings jointly handled approximately 65% of the total retail trade in the country. I do not think we are faring too badly in a world where there is an increasing concentration of power, both economic and financial. Let me say at once that various business schools at universities are rendering a service to the small businessman equal to that rendered by the Advisory Bureau at Potchefstroom. We are seriously considering whether a responsibility does not rest on the State itself to assist one or more of these institutions in their activities. That proves our argument that we approve of what they are doing.</p>
<p>I do not want to refer to the central business district of Durban except to say that the people who according to the hon. Senator opposed his draft five years ago, were from the nature of things not Nationalists.</p>

In fact, the Riekert Commission recommended that just as we had accepted the principle that industrial areas outside group areas should be colourless, we should accept the same principle in respect of business premises and business centres in which everyone could take part. That is being considered.</p>

<p>I do not want to have a long argument with the hon. Senator Webber. I just want to tell him that if he looks at the Bill he will find that it contains no prohibitions. The clause to which he referred contains definitions. Clause 1(2) defines a restrictive practice. A list of practices is given and their direct and indirect effects. In other words, it is not a specific activity <i>per se</i> that is being prohibited. I trust the hon. Senator understands that. He is the one who raised the question of distribution points. In terms of the Bill they are not prohibited <i>per se</i> but when certain activities have certain effects, effects which cannot be reconciled with the public interest, the provisions of the law come into operation and the board has to make recommendations.</p>

<p>How does the Government interpret this?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>In all reasonableness, Sir, the Government is not going to interpret anything. This legislation is part of a series of Acts that were passed by this hon. House. We have the Price Control Act, we have the Hire-Purchase Act and we have the Trade Practices Act which was passed the year before last. In terms of those Acts specific practices that are considered undesirable, can be prohibited. But a practice is prohibited because its effect is undesirable when tested against what is in the public interest. Let me give an example. There is something which worries us, Sir, and that is the increasing concentration of trade in less limited big companies, because that can mean&#x2014;and I want to choose my words carefully&#x2014;that because of that over-concentration of power in the retail trade, they can acquire bargaining power that places them above the bargaining power of their suppliers. I have already instructed the Board of Trade and Industries to investigate the effect of this over-concentration of power in the hands of commerce <i>vis-à-vis</i> industry. There is a difference between bargaining in order to obtain the most favourable conditions for oneself and blackmailing someone because one is the only one who sells his product If we wish to broaden the base of industry we must also look after its interests.</p>
<p>Sir, I think I have replied to all the questions put by hon. Senators and I have stated our attitude as far as this specific matter is concerned.</p>
<p>Question agreed to.</p>
<p>Bill read a Second Time.</p>
</speech>
<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>
<p>Clause 1:</p>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise merely to get some sort of understanding from the hon. the Minister regarding the question I put to him during the debate on the Second Reading. I had hoped not to have a debate in the Committee Stage over this issue. The situation is such, Sir, that a board is to be established that will investigate matters that are explained in clause 1 under the definition of &#x201C;restrictive practice&#x201D;. As the hon. the Minister says, that board will eventually establish competition policy. But in the establishment of that competition policy that board will be guided by what is written in this legislation; it is also going to be guided by the intention of this Parliament That is what I am trying to ascertain from the hon. the Minister. What precisely is his intention? Is his intention with this definition as it appears here, a definition which includes a business practice or method of training including any method of fixing prices, to interpret this as a method of fixing prices, whether the prices are in fact fixed or not? That is the question that I am putting to him. Because it is my contention that the prices are not fixed, but it is a method of fixing prices. I think the hon. the Minister will understand my point of view. I believe that the Board will be guided not only by what is written here but by the intention of the legislature. We form the legislature. I want to support the hon. the Minister. I would interpret this to Neman that the prices are not fixed. A list of prices is sent out by a distribution centre to its members, a list which sets out the recommended selling prices but it contains different prices. Those firms that have to pay transport costs can sell at a higher price than those who operate in a delivery area where there are no transport costs. My interpretation is such, but when I am asked to accept this, then I ask the hon. the Minister whether that is his interpretation. Is that the intention of the Government when they ask us to pass this? Because it is the intention of the legislature which is going to have to guide the com-nittee when it makes its decision. It is for hat reason that I ask this question in all seriousness and in all honesty of the hon. the Minister. I do not want to delay the proceedings here at all.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-economic-affairs">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, let me start again. The definition of a restrictive practice in the Bill before us, is no different from the existing Act It is the same thing. There is no prohibition <i>per se</i> against a restrictive practice. But what the Act does and what the Bill intends to do is to define firstly a practice as restrictive which has certain consequences. If the hon. Senator will look at the definitions clause, he will find that&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x201C;restrictive practice&#x201D; means the following&#x2014;</block>
<ol>
<li>(a) Any agreement, arrangement or understanding whether legally enforceable or not between two or more persons; or</li>
<li>(b) any business practice or method of trading including any method of fixing prices whether by the supplier of any commodity or otherwise; or</li>
<li>(c) any act or ommission on the part of any person whether acting independently or in concert with any other person; or</li>
<li>(d) any situation arising out of the activities of any person or class or group of persons,</li>
</ol>
<p>which, by directly or indirectly restricting competition, has or is calculated to have the effect of the following &#x2026;</p>
<p>The test is a factual test, it is not a legal one. When the board has to determine whether any restrictive practice exists and should be prohibited, the board has to interpret whether certain practices have or are intended to have the results that are now enunciated from 1 to 7. That is the answer to his question. He could not ask me at this stage to anticipate the board&#x2019;s function because that would be tantamount to telling this House what the board should and should not do.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I rise merely to reply in the first place to a few remarks that were made during the Second Reading debate and the Committee Stage. I want firstly to say to the hon. Senator Dempsey that I agree with him when he says that a Minister who accepts suggestions from the Opposition is a good Minister. I say this because certain of the Opposition&#x2019;s amendments have been accepted. I wish our NP Ministers would take this objective sort of attitude more often. I am very much in earnest about this. It has often happened in the past that Ministers have been too stubborn to admit that an amendment of the Opposition could be an improvement to the Bill, even though it was a good amendment. [Interjections.] I do not want to argue with the hon. the Minister. I agree with him and I thank him for that very good interjection which he has made.</p>
<p>I want now to refer to what the hon. the Minister said about the position of power in respect of negotiation where supply is concerned which those people are in who have the demand or who &#x2026;</p>

<p>Which they could be in, not are in.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, could be.</p>
<p>I just want to point out to the hon. the Minister that positions of power could develop in both instances. During the economic boom we found that the suppliers were in a position of power and this brought the very unhealthy practice of price maintenance into our commercial life. The hon. the Minister will remember that. It was an extremely unhealthy practice and we simply could not eliminate it despite all the legislation at our disposal, for the simple reason that one could not always obtain evidence against the suppliers of certain products to the effect that they were forcing people to sell at certain retail prices. The retailer simply had to decide if he wanted to be in or outside the market If he wanted to be outside the market he had to refuse to apply price maintenance and its price fixing. Then he did not get supplies. Suppliers did not have to give him any excuses. They could simply say they could not supply him. As far as the position of power is concerned, the same applies in the present circumstances to people who supply retailers and who have to obtain their wholesale supplies either from the wholesalers or the manufacturers.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, a most important announcement in recent times has come from the Government I think it is a known fact and it has been declared before that the public could also now buy shares in Sasol and also in the new company to be established to manufacture diesel engines in this country. There is, however, always an anomoly somewhere in the Government&#x2019;s policy because while we are trying to encourage the manufacture of diesel engines, an extra tax has at the same time been imposed on diesel to the private sector in the latest budget Yes, that is so. The hon. the Minister must make sure of that [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I know why that tax was imposed. The hon. the Minister need not tell me about that However, if we really want to manufacture engines in South Africa we should not only manufacture diesel engines. We should manufacture engines of all types and all kinds, including those that use petrol. I believe that in a country like ours&#x2014;and I am now in quite a different field&#x2014;we should encourage the manufacture of all types of engines for the reason that out of our crude oil that we import a certain amount of petrol is also manufactured and we cannot avoid that.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>That is what the hon. the Minister said.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>To be able to manufacture a certain amount of diesel oil one must also produce a certain amount of petrol or high-octane fuel, whatever one prefers to call it The point in this regard is that we should try to establish a national engine factory in the general sense, and not only in respect of diesel engines.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, I also want to say to the hon. the Minister that as far as Sasol and this new company are concerned in which the public will be able to obtain shares&#x2014;and I believe that everybody who has the country&#x2019;s interests at heart will be just as keen to invest in these companies as in Defence Bonds or anything else&#x2014;I would welcome the removal of yet another restriction. It need not be done immediately but it can be kept in mind, and that is the fact that these companies will always be under State control. To my mind the essence of free enterprise is that when the public feels they can proceed to the stage where they hold the majority of the shares, they must also have the right to rely on those people who in their view will produce the most profitable results and pay the highest dividends on their shares. Does the hon. the Minister agree with me? I should like to know what he thinks about this.</p>
<p>†In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to say to the hon. Senator Winchester that I did not quite agree with him when he spoke about the disappearance of the small trader and brought this into line with the present legislation. I cannot see that the legislation now before us has the same sort of goal as that which the hon. Senator Winchester seem to imply. We are all very sorry to see the small trader disappearing, but, Sir, this is a sign of our times; it is a sign of development I can quote many other instances where the small enterprise have disappeared, and I think of one in particular that is very dear to us, where many of us started our education in the early days, and I am referring to farm schools. Virtually all farm schools have disappeared and everything is aimed at centralization, not only in regard to education but also in reard to centralization of businesses. The small trader just cannot make a living. Should one go to the country districts today one will find many towns in South Africa where huge school hostels were built&#x2014;and the hon. Minister as a former M.E.C. will know this&#x2014; and they are all standing empty.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Oh no, farmers do their duty, but they feel they are duty-bound in respect of schools where there are the heaviest concentrations because these schools attract the best teaching staff and there is really mutual competition between the teaching staffs to get the best they can for the schools.</p>
<p>†But, Mr. President, in regard to supermarkets I want to point out that the OK Bazaars started in 1929. And I mention the OK Bazaars because for a long time this was regarded as the only supermarket But the formation of the OK Bazaars did not necessarily eliminate the small trader. Then other supermarkets were established and in the years of the economic boom, in the 1970s they mushroomed. But this is still not a monopoly because the number of supermarkets has increased and the competition amongst the supermarkets has also increased. I therefore feel that it does not fall within the ambit of this Bill. As the hon. the Minister rightly said, I think the intention of this Bill is to prevent the elimination of competition where there is a limited market for a certain commodity. This, in my view, is the sort of thing we are supporting today, and not the disappearance of the small trader or anything along those lines.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the maintenance of independent traders is, in my view, really the purpose of this Bill. But we live in a world of competition and should one go to an older town like Kimberley, one would find old shops closed down, shops that were previously large concerns. But what were they, Sir? These were wagon shops. In former days these shops manufactured horse-drawn chariots, they cared for horses and harnesses and things of that nature. But time has passed them by and they are there no more. I regret the disappearance of these shops, Sir, because they are part of an historic and very colourful past, but times have passed them by and in a business sense we have to accept that these things do happen. But I want to reiterate again, I don&#x2019;t think it falls within the ambit of this Bill. The purpose of this Bill, to my mind, is very different, and I have already explained my viewpoint With this new Bill that is to replace the old legislation I am sure that in future, as far as our economy is concerned, competition will be freer and more open but, most important of all, competition will be maintained.</p>

I refer to the question of the retailer. The hon. Senator Swanepoel quite rightly said that it is inevitable that there has been a reduction in the number of retailers; that is an economic inevitability. That is true. In this respect I have to agree to a large extent with what the hon. Senator Winchester said and I think that that is the first time that has happened since I have been in this House.</p>

<p>If a powerful country like America and a country like England have taken certain steps, far-reaching steps, to protect their small businesses, we must accept that there are good reasons for it These countries, having experienced the consequences of the disappearance of the small trader to the extent that it became a matter for concern, acted a little too late. And it is far more difficult to put a matter right when there has been too much delay than when timeous action has been taken.</p>
<p>In this regard I want to refer with appreciation to what has been done by the Bureau for Economic Advice of Potchefstroom University. They are doing outstanding work, but if I remember correctly that bureau has already come to the conclusion that they alone are not able to do justice to this very important matter. The hon. the Minister has said that he attaches a great deal of importance to the role played by the retailer and so I want to say that we must not underestimate the dangers which threaten him. I also want to ask if he and his department or the Bureau for Economic Advice will not make inquiries as to what is being done by a country such as America&#x2014;perhaps they have already done it&#x2014;and what is being done in England to protect the retailer. These countries are considering drastic steps.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>I did not intend to speak, but I have to after having been supported by my very dear friend, the hon. Senator Dr. Visser. In my 13 years in Parliament it has not happened to me before that a man of his stature and with his knowledge of this particular subject, has supported a humble person such as myself in this field. I am only sorry that I did not attend some of the lectures that he must have given on this subject because I would then have been better informed. Equally, I think my friend on my right, the hon. Senator Swanepoel, who chose to disagree with me today, did not quite take the point I was making. I have the very strong conviction, which was far better expressed by the hon. Senator Dr. Visser than I could have done, that the small businessman is the backbone of our economy. The hon. the Minister has all sorts of powers and I have respect for the way he applies himself to this particular portfolio, despite our disagreements politically. I am not quarreling with him one iota this afternoon. I want to reserve that for other occasions. However, I wish to appeal to him, and I cannot appeal better than the hon. Senator Dr. Visser has done, to try to ensure that the small businessman is kept in business as long as possible. I know the hon. Senator Swanepoel is perfectly correct when he says that a lot of this is due merely to changing times and that it has nothing to do with the Government It is due perhaps to advancement and progress. I often wonder if progress is warranted or worthwhile in this instance. As I tried to say at the Second Reading, one reads reports that there is going to be an amalgamation of large companies for the rationalization of their profits and that the intention is to keep prices down but I cannot think of one single instance where prices have in fact been kept down.</p>
<p>I want to deal with a subject about which I do know something, viz. the insurance industry. 15 or 20 years ago there were more than 90 insurance companies operating in South Africa. Some of them were overseas companies but they all operated very successfully. A very good case was made out for their amalgamation on the basis of bringing down costs, rationalization and all sorts of very high-sounding reasons. As a result, there are now fewer than 30 insurance companies operating in South Africa. All the rest have amalgamated, been bought out or have been absorbed in one way or another. In every single instance the cost to the public in respect of insurance premiums has in fact increased. It has not improved at all; but not only that, the service has deteriorated. When the companies were smaller, the individual was dealt with as a personality while today he is nothing but a number in a computer. The personalities have disappeared. I am sure the hon. Minister knows something about this subject and he will agree with me that the essence of what used to be good insurance business has been removed and that one now deals with an amorphous thing, a computer, which has no character and no feelings.</p>

<p>Yes, I am very much in favour of small caucuses. [Interjections.] The point I am making, and I hope the hon. the Minister will take me seriously, is that he must find some way to prevent the small business concern from going out of business. The advent of large supermarkets and hypermarkets is in fact killing off our central city areas. They are becoming cemeteries fairly early in the day and especially at night because business is moving into the suburbs. The small shop in the suburb is not benefitting by it because that is where the supermarkets are also operating.</p>
<p>I am not looking for any magic formula from the hon. the Minister in this respect, but I do appeal to him to give very serious consideration to this aspect With these conglomerates and massive companies, when they get hurt financially, the country gets hurt financially. There is no way out I think the hon. Sen. Dr. Visser said in his first speech that ultimately&#x2014;and this has been projected in several books by experts on the subject&#x2014; one will find that the whole economy of South Africa is being run and controlled by four or five big organizations. That cannot be beneficial to the economy of the country. All I can do is appeal to the hon. the Minister to look at this aspect continually to see that our economy is not harmed by these big conglomerates which are taking over the small businesses.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I do not intend keeping the House for long. I would, however, like to say to the hon. Senator Swanepoel that my usual custom when I receive amendments which I think are an improvement to legislation, is to accept them. That is standard practice as far as I am concerned. I just want to tell him that the one we have now accepted was moved at the suggestion of the PFP and is not an amendment of the NRP.</p>
<p>I should like to make a few comments in regard to the manufacture of engines. These diesel engines are manufactured for heavy vehicles. They are also manufactured pursuant to strategic considerations. I want to leave the matter at that because I cannot define the components of the strategy now. We also intend to manufacture the whole transmission system so that we can then have a tractor which is manufactured <i>in toto</i> in this country. That is what we have in mind for ourselves in the manufacturing process. As far as petrol engines are concerned, the engine blocks are already being made in the Republic. In this respect we have gone much further than we have with diesel engines. If the private sector enters the engine manufacturing industry they can take it over. They can have full control. There may be a false impression that private enterprise is more efficient than State corporations, but that is not true.</p>

<p>No, on diesel vehicles.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes. The tax is levied on the heavy diesel engine and the reason for this is very simple. Diesel is used more than petrol for production purposes in our country. A few years ago I warned manufacturers to bear in mind the fact that we had been experiencing energy problems in regard to liquid fuels since the crisis of 1973 and that the situation would continue indefinitely. I said that precisely because in terms of usage diesel is used to a very large extent for production purposes in industry, in agriculture, in the mines and even in commerce, as far as passenger vehicles are concerned we should rather not move in the direction of the manufacture of passenger vehicles. The manufacturing industry paid no attention to me and the same applied to our consumers, with the result that although we have succeeded in keeping the consumption of petrol almost static over the past four years, the consumption of diesel has increased by 25%. That was the reason why we took these steps.</p>
<p>Today I want to issue the warning again&#x2014; and I want to do so repeatedly&#x2014;that if the world creates problems for us, diesel will in the first instance have to be used for production purposes and thereafter for personal purposes. It stands to reason that we must keep the wheels of the economy turning. I can see no other solution; that is my responsibility. As far as the small business is concerned, I have already stated my attitude and I have already put the factual situation, but I want to say this: We must correct the misapprehension which exists, viz. that the large supermarkets are necessarily the end of the small businessman. What in fact do we find? In such an atmosphere the place of the specialized shop&#x2014;which is usually that of the small businessman&#x2014;is being enlarged. That is why we find in the large shopping complexes which are being built there are a series of small businesses, and this is something I welcome. The most important requirement of the small business undertaking is, in the first place, capital, but in the second place it is practical business acumen. That is the very task of this advisory bureau and other business schools of the universities which provide this service. I want to take this opportunity too of thanking the business schools of the various tertiary educational institutions for the work they are doing to eliminate this shortcoming in regard to the small businessman&#x2019;s management of his undertaking.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Hon. Senators will agree with me that the amending Bill which we are now considering concerns a product which is of the greatest strategic value and importance to us in South Africa. Sir, let me say immediately that since the acceptance of the Bill in the Other Place the strategic importance of this product has been further emphasized. The restrictions presently imposed by many oil-producing countries on the free supply of crude oil and petroleum products to other countries but also specifically to South Africa must be seen as an important component of the total onslaught on South Africa in the political, economic, military and psychological fields.</p>
<p>For a country to use its economy as a power base or as a lever for achieving its political, military or other strategic objectives is not only typical of the times in which we live, it is also a practice which can to a greater or lesser extent be found in the history of some decades ago. I do not want to bore hon. Senators with details in this particular connection, but I just want to mention briefly that as the competition between East and West, and what they represent, and the confrontation between rich and poor countries has become more subtle and assumed more sophisticated forms, especially since the Second World War, the use of economic power will play an increasingly important part in the methods used by countries in the future to achieve their international aims in the political sphere and elsewhere.</p>
<p>South Africa is involved in the struggle between East and West in a very special sense, i.e. because South Africa possesses important raw materials such as base metals and primary products, which the economies of the industrial countries of Western Europe need for their survival. In this respect, the fact that we are richly endowed with raw materials holds a definite advantage for us. The East, and more specifically Soviet Russia and its satellites, see the acquisition of control over these raw materials as an important step in obtaining a stranglehold on the powerful economies of the industrial countries of the West In their turn&#x2014;and we should not ignore this&#x2014;the grievances or the supposed grievances harboured by some Black States against South Africa offer the Soviet Union the pretext to intervene in Southern Africa in order to achieve its objective. Therefore our rich resources of raw materials, which are a source of power to us on the one hand, are at the same time the reason why we find ourselves at the centre of the power struggle between conflicting ideologies, at the centre of the confrontation between the rich countries in the northern hemisphere and the poor countries in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, while the international onslaught against South Africa had already been planned for many decades, it has become more apparent during the past number of years that our enemies are actively planning to make use of coercive economic measures to force us to make certain changes in our internal political and social dispensations on the one hand and, on the other hand, to gain an advantage in the international struggle for power.</p>
<p>A new dimension has accordingly been given to this economic side of the onslaught against South Africa in that many organizations are bringing heavy pressure to bear on the governments of countries which are our main trading partners as well as our business undertakings in those countries, to apply certain punitive measures against South Africa. This is, for example, reflected in the resolution concerning the arms embargo against South Africa which the Security Council adopted in November 1977; the restrictions which the American Export-Import Bank has placed on loans to South African importers; and the so-called codes of conduct in respect of employment practices in South Africa which have been adopted by business undertakings in the United States of America and by the governments of the member states of the European community.</p>
<p>In view of what I have said so far, it is obvious that for the sake of our own survival, South Africa has to analyse this economic onslaught against the country very carefully and that the Republic has to prepare an effective counter strategy to stave off the onslaught or, if this should prove impossible, to limit the impact thereof on the South African economy to a minimum.</p>
<p>*The measures contained in this amending Bill must be seen as a component of the total strategy which South Africa has to apply to safeguard its position against the total onslaught to which it is now being subjected.</p>
<p>Clause 1:</p>
<p>As hon. Senators know, it is intended to make regulations shortly in terms of the Petroleum Products Act, 1977, which will establish control over the utilization and rerefining of used lubricating oil. In terms of the proposed regulations certain positive obligations will be placed on persons who are in possession of used lubricating oil, but the Government law advisers believe that more explicit authority should be given to the Minister of Economic Affairs&#x2014;as proposed in clause 1 of the Bill&#x2014;otherwise the validity of such regulations could perhaps be questioned.</p>
<p>†Clauses 2 and 5:</p>
<p>Hon. Senators are aware of the fact that since the end of last year there has been a severe imbalance in the demand for and the supply of crude oil and petroleum products on the international markets and that this situation still prevails today. In fact, as I have indicated, the position has been aggravated, because of recent actions. It is therefore difficult at present for all oil-importing countries to secure sufficient supplies at reasonable prices and especially to negotiate such supplies on a long term basis.</p>
<p>In this regard I accordingly requested most of our newspaper editors to meet me during the first week of February 1979, on which occasion I informed them confidentially of the present situation and impressed upon them the necessity that newspaper reports regarding the procurement and supply of petroleum to South Africa should at all times be handled with the greatest circumspection. Although the editors present accepted my good intentions I regret that despite their assurances of co-operation, a number of reports jeopardizing our position has been published of alleged negotiations for supply contracts for South Africa. Incidentally, in certain cases those negotiations failed, because of the publicity.</p>
<p>Editorials have also been published criticizing me as Minister for not informing the public of our oil supply position and thereby causing resistance among the public instead of securing their co-operation with our conservation efforts. Mr. President, in the light of this I had no alternative but to inform the Newspaper Press Union that I would have to seek legal powers to prohibit the indis-cretionary reporting on the matters referred to in clause 2 of this Bill. I have also made a public statement in this regard. In the present circumstances it would obviously be irresponsible if the Government and I in particular were to allow newspaper reporting which would endanger our present and possible future lines of supply.</p>
<p>Mr. President, in the course of my consultations with the oil industry and the Newspaper Press Union I have given the assurance that, despite the prohibition, standing exemption in terms of the provisions of the proposed section 4A will be granted enabling the oil industry, to operate efficiently and the news media to report on all matters which will not detrimentally affect matters such as the procurement, supply, shipping and stock-piling of petroleum products.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, in this regard I want to point out that I have since had further discussions with the Press Union and as a result of those discussions I moved amendments in the Other Place which now form part of the legislation under consideration. I am pleased that all parties support this legislation. It proves the extent of the co-operation of which we are capable when there is consensus regarding the best interests of our country.</p>
<p>†Hon. Senators will note that the provisions of the proposed Section 4A are similar to those of section 118 of the Defence Act, 1957 and I assume that they will appreciate that the objective of both these measures are of equal importance from a security point of view. For this reason also the proposed penalty in clause 5, namely a maximum fine of R7 000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding seven years or both, will place the penalties for offences in terms of these two measures on a par.</p>
<p>*I conclude with clauses 3 and 4. Section 9 of the existing Act already contains a presumption that the accused has used fuel for the performance of an act which constitutes an offence in terms of the Act. Because of a technicality, many offenders have nevertheless secured their acquittal by submitting that other factors, such as the slope of the road or the wind, played a part in a contravention of the prescribed speed limits.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment seeks to rectify the position in this connection.</p>
<p>In terms of the State Oil Fund Amendment Act which was piloted through Parliament earlier this year, the establishment of an Equalization Fund was approved, a fund which is to be used for financing the difference between Opec prices and those South Africa has to pay for the purchase of crude oil in the open market. The Government has now agreed that fines imposed for contraventions of the speed limit in terms of the fuel conservation measures taken under the Petroleum Products Act may be paid into the Equalization Fund. The amendment of section 11 of the Act, as proposed in clause 4, confers the necessary powers upon the Minister to make such an arrangement in consultation with the Minister of Finance. I want to say immediately that I do not intend doing this without the co-operation of local and provincial authorities.</p>
<p>Clause 6 contains a consequential amendment to the existing long title of the Act and clause 7 contains the short title of the amending Bill.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I just want to add that before introducing the Bill&#x2014;and this also applies to the Bill concerning national supplies&#x2014;I made a copy of the Bill available to the NPU, so that they could study it and comment upon it After the introduction of the Bill, the NPU requested that the Bill be amended to exclude the member publications of the NPU from the provisions of the Bill, saying that an agreement could then be entered into in order to regulate reporting on this matter by members of the NPU. I did not accept this proposal although I accepted another amendment to which I have already referred.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, in contrast to the previous legislation, the Bill now before us has only five relevant clauses. If one was present at the discussion of the previous legislation and had listened to the introductory speech of the hon. the Minister in regard to this Bill, one could almost say that this legislation was a continuation of the previous Bill, although that is not so at all. It simply shows the importance fuel has assumed as a source of energy in our economy in the past and just recently.</p>
<p>We have seen certain allegations and statements in the Press recently to the effect that the hon. the Minister is shortly to introduce still more restrictive measures and also that the price of fuel will be increased. The restrictive measures will be applied in order to ensure a continuous supply; continuous supply, but not at the same price. The Bill we are now dealing with is probably more important at this stage in South Africa than all the other contentious legislation we have had recently. So much of the progress and the growth which we hope to achieve in the future depends not only on the effectiveness of this Bill but also on whether we can succeed in managing our economy on such a basis that the availability of supplies and our prices will be kept to certain scales and within certain limits, and that we can bring them into line with our progress, particularly with a view to curbing our inflation rate. That is why I say that this is very important legislation because, as the hon. the Minister said in his reference to the restrictions on the Press, fuel has not only become a matter of great importance in our economy but it has also become a matter of sensitivity in these times.</p>
<p>I want to start with clause 1 on which the hon. the Minister mentioned the re-refining of lubricating oil. Hon. Senators who have spent a considerable time with me in this hon. Senate will remember that this is something which has been discussed on various occasions. Prior to 1973 it was not a matter of urgency, because at that time the price of oil had reached a low point on the world market. I think that hundreds of thousands of gallons of old oil were thrown away on rubbish dumps and other places from the various points where large quantities of this lubricating oil had been tapped off. At that time we pointed out that we were wasting a large source of energy. If one had started to collect all the old oil which has been thrown away over the years, especially in the years since major industrialization, I wonder what we could have collected by this time and what the degree of our waste would have been. In the light of our present position the rerefining of old oil is a horse of a different colour, of course. It has not only become economic but it has become a matter of urgent necessity in the light of supply and availability. I do not want to elaborate on this, except to make a recommendation to the hon. the Minister in regard to old oil. We have certain growth points in South Africa which are far removed from the nearest refining points. Because oil, especially lubricating oil, has become so important, I wonder whether certain concessions cannot be made, especially in respect of the transport of old oil to the nearest refining points. I am thinking in terms of a railway tariff rebate, whether by way of road transport or by way of normal train transport to the various refining points. For the information of the hon. the Minister I want to mention one such point, which he also knows about I am thinking of a point like Sishen and Kathu which is the major supply point of iron ore for Saldanha harbour. It is not only a point of activity as far as Iscor is concerned but there are also a large number of construction companies and private undertakings there. I am sure enormous quantities of lubricating oil could be tapped off each day in that area which could be transported to the nearest refining point, e.g. Bloemfontein, Johannesburg or one of those places. I think this is a field which has been lying fallow for all practical purposes, and we must give attention to this and see how much we can do here. There is incontrovertible evidence that properly refined lubricating oils are in no way inferior in lubricating efficiency to the new oil one gets out of a tin.</p>
<p>The next point I want to mention is the question of the fines which the hon. the Minister mentioned and which could perhaps be deposited in the Equalization Fund. I support that suggestion of the hon. the Minister one hundred per cent. I think it will be a very good suggestion, not only from the point of view of the Equalization Fund but also from the point of view of the public and their attitude to our traffic officers. Nobody likes being fined, no matter what sort of fine it is. But experience has probably taught the hon. the Minister as a legal practitioner that when it is a policeman who is the cause of the fine, then the person concerned nurses a grudge against the policeman. If it is a traffic officer who is responsible, the same thing happens in his case. The general assumption among the travelling public today, according to the widely believed theory, is that a traffic officer is appointed firstly to earn his salary in traffic fines and secondly to show a profit over and above his salary. When this allegation is made, one can hardly blame the public, particularly when they know that the local authority concerned is struggling financially to make ends meet.</p>

<p>When it becomes generally known that these fines are to be paid into the Equalization Fund, I think the attitude of the public will change in these matters. I also believe that there will be a better understanding of why these fines are really imposed. I am not talking now of municipal fines in small towns and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I am speaking mainly of fines on our national roads. If we look at the matter in its right perspective, why did the hon. the Minister introduce another Bill like this one? It is to save fuel. And if we do not save fuel accordingly, the Equalization Fund which will be responsible for the maintenance of a constant price for fuel for as long as possible will be depleted sooner because we will have to import more fuel. In the long run it will be the Equalization Fund which will be prejudiced, and in that respect we shall again have to raise the premium to keep our fuel prices constant If these fines can be paid into that fund, I think that it will contribute, even in a small way, to delaying an increase in fuel prices for a certain time, even if it is only for a very short time. I am in contact with the public just as the hon. the Prime Minister is in contact with the public, but they speak more freely with me than they do with the hon. the Prime Minister. We expected fuel price increases 14 days ago, and you would be surprised to know what a relief it was for the public to have that 14 days&#x2019; grace before the price was in fact raised.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the matter of the Press. Irresponsible action in life is not something which is confined only to the Press. Irresponsible action is found in the highest circles of our society. It is found in governments, one finds it in State departments and one finds it everywhere. But I should like to express the hope that the hon. the Minister will renew discussions with the Press from time to time and that it will not be necessary to act against these people. At the same time I should like to express the hope that our Press too will show a sense of responsibility. It is in their interests just as much as in the country&#x2019;s interests that certain things should not be published. It is really important that our Press should realize their responsibility in this regard. I think the best way to do so under any circumstances is to try to obtain co-operation rather than to resort to compulsion or penal measures.</p>
<p>I just want to mention that the hon. the Minister is the person who possesses information which none of us possesses in connection with our fuel position. We do not expect him to make that information available to us because it is sensitive information. It is information which, as the hon. the Minister said, can do harm. I think he should make a request to the Press that when they have certain information they should come to him and discuss it with him and say: &#x201C;Minister, I have certain information. May I publish it or not?&#x201D; I do not think the hon. the Minister has any objection to publication of a report which is newsworthy. But I do think that he would be responsible enough to say to the man at that stage: &#x201C;I think you should leave it alone,&#x201D; or: &#x201C;You can publish it if it is not contrary to our interests.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Very well, Sir, then the hon. the Minister and I are still on the same wavelength.</p>
<p>In conclusion I should like to refer to what the hon. the Minister said in respect of pressure from abroad which is being brought to bear on us, viz. pressure being brought to bear on countries to approve an oil boycott against us and so on. I want to say the following to the hon. the Minister to reassure him. I am a bystander, I am not in his position, and often I see the matter through a bystander&#x2019;s eyes. I am not in the responsible position of the hon. the Minister, but in my view he should not be too perturbed about those matters. During the discussion of the previous Bill an hon. Senator said: &#x201C;Money talks.&#x201D; Our trading partners will really think very hard before they agree to such a boycott because, just like us, they realize that a sound economy is the pivot around which a country&#x2019;s security and prosperity revolves and on which its standing in the world is based.</p>
<p>Without mentioning facts or factors, I can say today that South Africa has become a country of strategic importance to many of those countries. So I cannot see that they would for one moment be so stupid as to take steps, even with the Carter Administration ruling in America, to do anything like that. Mr. President, this is not simply a hope I am expressing. On a certain occasion when I was still a young man I travelled with an American businessman and as long ago as that he predicted what is happening in South Africa today. In fact, he predicted the things that are contained in the Wiehahn and Riekert reports. He said to me: &#x201C;The economic laws are going to remove all these problems from your path; you as a politician need do nothing about it, the economic laws will do it&#x201D; In the present-day world which is becoming more and more materialistic, these same economic considerations, in my view, are on our side, and I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the situation is not giving me sleepless nights. I hope I can persuade him to feel that way too. I know the hon. the Minister has more information than I do and I can see why he adopts a certain standpoint, but when one takes a close look, one realizes that our major trading partners, in my view, cannot afford to support an oil boycott against South Africa.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I agree with what the hon. Senator Swanepoel said in regard to the length of the Bill before us. It is a short but nevertheless an important Bill. I think it is correct that he has dealt with it at length in the light in which he as an Opposition member sees it, and I hope that he will afford me the same opportunity to deal with it in the light in which we on this side of the House see it.</p>
<p>When I was charged with speaking on this Bill, I spent a considerable time considering what the implications would be should it be passed by this hon. House. Although on the face of it, it seems to be a very simple Bill, I realized that the manner in which the Government will be utilizing this fund that is to be created, could be of immense importance in regard to the distribution of this product. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me, Mr. President, that today we are not buying petrol, dieseline, napthalene or any other product, but we are buying the barrel as a whole when we import crude oil. Therefore, Sir, although the Government is not in favour of interfering in the marketing of a product, it nevertheless has a very distinct and definite obligation to ensure that the total product contained in one barrel of crude oil is equally distributed in order to ensure optimum utilization of that particular product. No purpose can therefore be served by talking about saving this, that or the other product. We have to consider the total quantity of what we have to import in order to produce the fuel itself. We cannot save dieseline at the cost of using too much of the petrol at our disposal. We cannot save petrol without having regard to what is going to happen to the other products that are derived from a barrel of crude oil.</p>
<p>It is true that there has been a shortage of fuel or crude oil throughout the world. The hon. the Minister knows better than I do what the production of the various world centres is. If one is prepared to do some research into the available statistics one sees that the Iranian production was in the vicinity of 5,27% of world production. Should the Iranian oil production be cut out of the total anticipated oil production for next year completely, it would only mean a loss of 6,53% of the total world production of crude oil.</p>
<p>I agree with the hon. the Minister, Mr. President, that although there is this very small shortage we have nevertheless experienced an extremely peculiar phenomenon in the world, and that is that this 5,27% of crude oil produced by Iran has been so sought after by the world that it has caused a tremendous spiralling of the fuel price, with the result that we have almost reached panic stations. President Carter recently passed certain legislation which made it possible for the United States of America to further subsidize imports. This shows how serious the United States was in its efforts to secure a portion of the 5,27% crude oil produced by Iran.</p>
<p>But if one takes into account the fact that Iran has not stopped producing oil altogether at this stage&#x2014;her production is of the order of 2,4 million to 3 million barrels per day&#x2014; one realizes that there is a world shortage of fuel of 3,854% and not of 5,27%. That is the total discrepancy between the production of fuel and world consumption as of this moment. By next year that shortage will be reduced to approximately 1,2%.</p>
<p>In contrast to that, Sir, a particular portion of the contents of a barrel will be out of balance if we do not do something about it now, and I want to refer to what might happen in 1982, because I think it is important. What the hon. the Minister does with the funds at his disposal, is in fact going to determine what part of the contents of the barrel is going to be used most. Because if we are going to get dieseline at half the price of petrol, we are going to use more dieseline. If we are going to use liquid petroleum gas at a price twice that of bunker fuel oil, we will use less liquid petroleum gas. It is necessary therefore to maintain a balance. At a later stage I will refer to what is in fact happening in this regard.</p>
<p>I have already given the figures that I want to mention to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. In 1982 there will be an overproduction of between 15 million and 23 million tons of liquid petroleum gas in the world. That seems to be a tremendous contrast to the fact that we are experiencing a serious shortage of crude oil. And when I refer to crude oil I am talking about what is commonly regarded as light Arabian crude. If we are going to have an over-production of liquid petroleum gas and we in this country are not prepared or are in any way unable to absorb that over-production, we are going to find ourselves in serious trouble in two years&#x2019; time and, as we approach that stage, the situation will escalate.</p>
<p>What could be the situation in the years ahead? If there is already a shortage of crude oil and the world is clamouring for supplies, what are the people who have an over-production going to do? They are going to force those countries that are experiencing a shortage of crude oil to buy from them in order to get rid of their over-production of liquid petroleum gas.</p>

<p>Mr. President, when the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat becomes President of this hon. House I think he will be more at liberty to make that kind of remark. I will acknowledge immediately that these two Bills are intertwined, but if one reads both these Bills&#x2014;I do not know whether the hon.

The second Bill makes provision for receiving benefits from the first. I think therefore that whether I speak about it either during the discussion of the second Bill or this one makes no difference whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I do not know about that hon. Senator but I think that he should get back into the barrel of oil. I will come back to the Bill immediately because his contribution out of a barrel of oil will probably be less than 5%. I want to say this to the hon. the Minister: I want to agree immediately that in the circumstances in which we live it would be wrong and dangerous to our security if the information as to where we were obtaining our oil&#x2014;or not obtaining our our oil, whatever the circumstances&#x2014;was broadcast ad lib for everybody to read. It would do serious damage to our national security, our well-being and our economy. I accept wholeheartedly that that is the sort of tiling that cannot be bandied about. Therefore, while I do not like the powers embodied in this clause, I hope it will not be necessary to have them for very long. I must however, tell the hon. the Minister that I am not happy in agreeing that he has to have these powers in this particular instance.</p>
<p>Having said that I am reminded of events in other parts of the world. I am thinking particularly about the Second World War when many things took place which the Press did not report, but they did not report them of their own volition and not because of any restrictions that were imposed upon them by the State. The State was able to depend on the loyalty and the goodwill of the news media. I cannot think of any instance where the media let the State down and jeopardized our national security. In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Minister said that there were instances where this had happened in spite of his appeals. People were irresponsible and did say things. I agree with him; we cannot even take a chance of that happening because of the circumstances. I was disappointed to learn from the hon. the Minister that there has been incidents like that I accept what he said in that regard. Having said that, however, I think it is right that I place on record my support for the clause. I am sorry that I have to do so but I do so because of the circumstances.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. H. S. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>
<p>[Inaudible.] Senator L. E. D. WINCHESTER: Mr. President, I cannot hear those mumbles over there, but it probably is just as well. What I would like to say to the hon. the Minister is this: So far, everything I have read about the difficulties of South Africa obtaining oil seems to indicate, certainly to my mind, that despite all that has been published, we have not yet got through to the man in the street. He does not necessarily realize the seriousness of the situation. He knows there is a problem about South Africa getting oil; he knows there is a boycott and that we have to buy oil under certain circumstances that are not favourable to us. He knows all that, but the hon. Senator Poorter&#x2014;I respect his knowledge in this respect although I was compelled to interrupt just now&#x2014;will be the first to agree with me that the motorist is being told that he has to save petrol. The whole emphasis seems to be in that direction, and yet petrol comprises only something like 27% or 30% of a barrel of oil. As I have said, the hon. Senator Poorter is more experienced than I am in this respect but it is a fact that the amount of petrol that comes out of a barrel of oil is small; the rest comprises diesel, tar and other products.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the users of those products, the products other than petrol, have to a large extent ignored the pleas of the authorities in regard to saving fuel. One hears about the saving of diesel which is a crucial product that we need desperately. But there are other products besides diesel; there is kerosene, tar and plastics which is also a by-product of oil. Yet the wastage of plastics in this country is tremendous. I want to give the hon. the Minister a small example: Nearly every housewife who goes into a supermarket expects and anticipates that the product she buys will be wrapped in plastic. I am not an authority on the by-products that are produced from a barrel of oil, but it would seem to me that the one product that we get in abundance from a barrel of oil, namely petrol, is the only product we implore the public not to waste.</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, let me start by trying to lay to rest a ghost that was raised a few minutes ago. Let me say to the hon. Senator Poorter that what he was saying was most interesting and what he was saying was quite true. I am fully aware of the fact that he knows what he is talking about but unfortunately he was talking at the wrong time. It was for that reason, Sir, that he had to raise this matter with you. I sincerely hope that he will get the opportunity sometime during this session when he will be able to place on record his particular thoughts on this matter. I want to say to the hon. Senator Poorter that when he reconsiders what he had intended saying this afternoon he should consult the writings of Prof. Milton Friedman, particularly where he writes about surpluses and shortages and the causes of surpluses and shortages.</p>
<p>I want to say something about one point he made, and I believe this is pertinent to the particular Bill before us, namely that I hope that the hon. the Minister has taken into consideration his comments regarding the application of a price differential for the different products. It will only be in that way that we will be able to control our consumption of crude oil and the products that we obtain from it It was precisely because of the imbalance which was created by a failure to apply a price differential to control the position that we had a crisis a little while ago. I want to urge the hon. the Minister to listen to what the hon. Senator had to say and to do something about maintaining a balance. [Interjections.] At the right time he can make his speech and we can all listen. However, I do not believe that the rules of this House were made simply to be ignored on occasions such as this.</p>
<p>Let me hasten to add my word to that of the hon. Senator Swanepoel and to say to the hon. the Minister that notwithstanding the fact that we believe in a free Press, we believe that a free Press is essential if democracy is to be maintained in this country, we will support the provisions of clause 2 of this Bill because we are aware of their importance and of the fact that this is essential. But I want to utter one word of warning to the hon. the Minister. I want to say to him that the fact that publication is prohibited except on the written authority of the Minister or of the controller of petroleum products places upon him an added burden, an added responsibility. I believe it is essential that he should exercise his discretion in this regard in the most careful manner.</p>
<p>The real reason why I wanted to discuss this Bill this afternoon was to discuss with the hon. the Minister the question of the imposition upon any person of any duty in connection with the saving of petroleum products. I want to discuss with him particularly the imposition of the levy of 6,4 cents in total that was imposed towards the end of last year. This had a tremendous effect on the country as a whole. The 6,4 cents per litre was not applied only to fuel oils but it was also applied to lubricating oils. It is there that I believe we have now again struck an imbalance, to come back to what the hon. Senator Poorter was saying. I believe that this levy has been applied in a manner which not only is unfair to certain users of lubricating oils but also has had a detrimental effect upon the country as a whole. We have developed in this country a re-refining industry, an industry which has grown from small proportions into a reasonably large one where at the moment millions of litres of oil are re-refined in this country. It is, however, an industry which can be expanded. It was the intention of the re-refiners to do so. After the imposition of this levy last year, I believe that representations were made to the hon. the Minister and to his department and, during February of this year, they were advised administratively that the 6,4 cents levy would not be applied in the case of lubricating oil belonging to a user that was sent to a re-refiner for re-refining and returned to the same user. They were advised that that levy would not be applied in that case. I believe that on 25 April that exemption was withdrawn. We now have the situation where a person, a large user of lubricating oil, who had the incentive to collect his oil, to barrel it, to send it to a re-refiner to be purified and to be returned to him, had the incentive of a price differential of 6,4 cents per litre. Because if that user had had to purchase new oil to use he would have had to pay the 6,4 cents levy per litre. Because of the exemption that had been granted by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department they were saving that. As a result, the figures show&#x2014;and I have the figures only of one of the re-refiners, one which operates in the area where I live&#x2014;that there was a tremendous upsurge in interest among large users of lubricating oil. Since the end of April, however, when these re-users found that they had to pay the 6,4 cents per litre levy, they have lost interest. Why should they go to the trouble and the expense of conserving this used oil, of collecting it, sending it back to the re-refining plant and collecting it again, when they can pour it down the drain and go and buy some more oil at, in fact, a saving, because they do not have the expense of conserving the used oil?</p>
<p>Mr. President, I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister this afternoon to reconsider this decision. I believe that he should use every means in his power to persuade people to conserve all types of petroleum products and in particular the one I am referring to, namely lubricating oil.</p>
<p>The second amendment proposed in clause l now gives the hon. the Minister the power to compel people to conserve lubricating oil, because he is taking the power here, for the purposes of ensuring a saving of petroleum products, to prohibit the disposal of any such product. In other words, Sir, he already has this power but, as he said in his introductory speech, this amendment is being effected to make it absolutely clear that he now has the power to say to a user of oil: You may not dispose of your used lubricating oils. We have this anomaly therefore that at the same time as the hon. the Minister comes before this House with a Bill to enable him to compel those large users of lubricating oil to conserve and not to dispose of their lubricating oil, he takes away the benefit that he gave them in February. I believe that this is counter-productive. I believe that it is against the interests of the country. I believe that there is a loss to the country, not only of the lubricating oil concerned but also of foreign exchange, and therefore I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister this afternoon to reconsider his policy in this regard and to exempt those re-refiners from the payment of the 6,4 cents levy per litre on used lubricating oil.</p>
<p>I want to stress this point to the hon. the Minister. I am referring here to a major user who conserves his own oil, sends it away for re-refining and gets his own oil back. I am not pleading for an exemption from this levy of all the oil that is re-refined. I wish I could, Sir, but I do not believe it can be justified because I think it would bring about tremendous administrative problems. But I also do not believe that the administrative problems that the department has encountered in this regard cannot be overcome. In my view it is not beyond the wit of man to devise a system by means of which this can be overcome.</p>
<p>I must also say this to the hon. the Minister, Sir. His colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, sits in the bench next to him. At the time when the Bill that introduced the general sales tax was brought to this House, that hon. Minister said to us that there had to be a degree of trust between the fiscus and the sales taxpayers. Sir, I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs to have that same sort of trust in the re-refiners and to allow them this concession.</p>
<p>There is one further question which I think must be put to the hon. the Minister when we consider the question of the imposition of a levy or a duty to ensure a saving of petroleum products. It is quite true that at the moment South Africa and most other countries in the world are paying a premium price for the crude oil that they are buying. But I do not believe that that situation is going to continue indefinitely. I believe that the time is going to come that there is going to be a reduction in the price of oil. I see the hon. the Minister is smiling and I know he thinks I am being naïve, but I want to say to him what I said to the hon. Senator Poorter: Go and read Milton Friedman and then you will understand why I make that statement. Because, Sir, this is part of a cycle that continues at all times. At the moment demand exceeds supply, but the wheel will turn and supply will exceed demand and we will go back or close to Opec prices. I do not know how correct these newspaper reports are but I understand from them that we are paying in the region of $35 a barrel for oil. That is more than twice the Opec price, but it will not remain at that level. The situation will change. But nowhere in the Act or in this Bill is there provision for a reduction of the levy. That is the question I want to put to the hon. the Minister. Is he going to think about this when the time comes?</p>

<p>Mr. President, on a point of order: I think the hon. Senator is under a misapprehension in that he is continuously referring to the duty which in Afrikaans is &#x201C;plig&#x201D;. He is trying to interpret the word &#x201C;duty&#x201D; as being a financial duty of impost. If I was wrong, Sir, he is doubly wrong. We are not talking about that kind of duty; we are talking about &#x201C;plig&#x201D;, the kind of duty one performs.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is strange that the hon. Senator should have ended his speech making the same mistake that he had accused another hon. Senator of making at the beginning of his speech. I shall cut my reply short, Sir.</p>
<p>I want to point out at once that the principles contained in this Bill are very simple. All hon. Senators also support it, although there is a difference in the degree of enthusiasm with which it is supported by various hon. Senators. Because I do not want there to be any doubt as to what my standpoint is, I want to say at once that there is not a single hon. Senator in the Senate who does not believe in the functions of the Press. There is also not one hon. Senator who does not believe that the Press, just like us, also has a responsibility. In the third place we all believe that there is a responsible Press in our country as well as an irresponsible one. And often it is regrettable that the responsible Press identifies itself with the irresponsible Press because of a Press identity instead of a responsibility identity.</p>
<p>The legislation provides for a restriction to be placed on the publication of information referring to these products as regards their origin, transport, available supplies and destinations. But the legislation also provides that persons or organs or groups or organs can be exempted from the provisions of the Bill by entering into an agreement where such organs in terms of an agreement undertake not to do certain things. Should such an agreement be entered into, the organs will be exempt from the provisions of the legislation. If they do not abide by the agreement, the punishment will in the first place not be the fines laid down in the legislation but a suspension of the agreement entered into. If that proves one thing, Sir, it proves in the first place the acknowledgement of this side of the House and, because of the support of the Opposition, also of their side, that a distinction must be drawn between those elements in the media who act responsibly and those who act irresponsibly. I look forward to the day when by way of an agreement I can be instrumental in contributing to the identification of those of our media which act responsibly in the interests of our country.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Winchester said that he had certain reservations in this particular connection regarding the acceptance of limitations to be placed on the Press. There is nobody who does not share his reservations, but there is also another set of reservations, namely when certain instruments and institutions in society place limitations on the country&#x2019;s ability to survive. And that is the object of this legislation and it affects everybody in the country. That is why I am very pleased that hon. Senators have adopted this attitude.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The Bill which is now before the House is actually consequential upon similar amendments considered in respect of the Petroleum Products Act, 1977.</p>
<p>As hon. Senators know, the Republic&#x2019;s programme for the stockpiling of strategic supplies is dealt with in terms of the National Supplies Procurement Act. I believe that the existence and content of any arrangements with regard to this programme should be confidential, so it is proposed that a new section 8A be inserted into the Act to prohibit the disclosure of any information by any person involved in any arrangement or order in terms of the Act.</p>
<p>Furthermore, clause 2 provides that when it is deemed necessary for the security of the Republic, the Minister may by notice prohibit the disclosure of any information relating to goods or services mentioned in the notice.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators will realize that this measure constitutes an attempt to prevent information which would endanger the security of the Republic from falling into the hands of hostile parties, and I trust that I shall be able to rely on the support of hon. Senators.</p>
<p>Mr. President, in this case, just as in the case of the Petroleum Products Amendment Bill, I agreed, after lengthy negotiations with the Newspaper Press Union, that provision be made in the Bill for an exemption from the provisions of the Bill to be arranged by way of agreement, as is in fact now provided in the Bill.</p>

<heading>SECOND STATE OIL FUND AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-economic-affairs">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The State Oil Fund Act, 1977, provides for two funds, viz. the State Oil Fund which is used as an instrument for the financing of Sasol II and the Equalization Fund which was established to finance the difference in price between the official Opec price and the international market price of crude oil.</p>
<p>It is necessary that the revenue basis of these funds be broadened and that they should not consist solely of the portion of excise and levies referred to in the Act. Accordingly, it is envisaged in terms of clauses 1 and 2(b) of this Bill to channel not only the fines referred to in section 11 of the Petroleum Products Act, 1977, but other moneys on which the Ministers of Finance and Economic Affairs may decide, to these two funds as well.</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that since the establishment of the levies on fuel earlier this year, certain large consumers have indicated that they are no longer going to purchase their petroleum products locally but are going to import them themselves for their own use and thus evade the payment of the levy.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, when I approached Parliament earlier this year for enabling legislation to impose levies on petroleum products, I indicated that all sectors of the economy should contribute equally not only to our efforts to save petroleum products but also to the payment of the levies imposed. I also pointed out that to achieve this goal no exemptions could be granted.</p>
<p>In order therefore to prevent certain large consumers from making use of a technical point to circumvent the payment of the levy, I propose that section 4A of the Act be amended as set out in clause 2(a) of the Bill before the House.</p>
<p>In terms of section 55 of the Act No. 11 of 1977 the Minister of Economic Affairs, in co-operation with the Minister of Finance, is empowered to issue guarantees to Sasol and certain subsidiary companies of Sasol. As such guarantees will also be required by a company named Sasol (Overvaal) Limited, which will be used as an instrument for the financing of the Sasol II extension project, it is proposed to amend the relevant section to provide for the possibility of having to issue such guarantees to this company. The pro posed amendment is contained in clause 3 of the Bill.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators will recall that when towards the end of last year I announced the Government&#x2019;s decision to impose levies on petroleum products with effect from 1 January 1979, Parliament was not in session, and that provision had to be made in the State Oil Fund Amendment Act, 1979, for the amending legislation to come into operation with retrospective effect from 1 January 1979. This was also necessary for the validation of the relevant notices provided for in section 3 of the Act. Since the promulgation of the Act the State Law Advisers have, however, indicated that although the said section provided for retroactivity, it was limited to the actual day on which the notices were served and that section 3 of the Act could not be interpreted as retrospective validation with retrospective effect from 1 January 1979 of the notices and the levies imposed thereunder. The provisions of clause 4 will now put this beyond any doubt.</p>
<p>Clause 5 contains amendments consequential to the provisions of clauses 3 and 4, and clause 6 contains the short title.</p>
<p>Let me say in anticipation that the Bill does not relate to the issues regarding the levies imposed on the various products. It only relates to the validation of what has already been done.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, with respect to the hon. the Minister, I think we must clearly clarify that point right now and I must refer the hon. the Minister to the new subsection 3A that he is inserting in the Act by way of this Bill. This provides that in addition to moneys raised by means of a levy, with the concurrence of the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance &#x201C;such other moneys as may accrue to such fund from any other source&#x201D; shall be paid into the Equalization Fund, and I submit that that includes the levy to which I refer. Therefore I would say to the hon. the Minister, please give me an answer to my questions.</p>

Senator Winchester make an intelligent contribution. I wanted to give the hon. Senator an opportunity of doing that.</p>
<p>I shall not take up much of the time of the House. There was an arrangement that when large consumers brought their used oil to the refineries for re-refinement, they did not pay the levies. But enormous administrative problems arose which the industry knows about. Deputations came to me, including members of Parliament, and I responded by saying that if they could make suggestions regarding re-refinement which would overcome the administrative problems, I should again consider exemption from the levy in respect of that oil. I am now waiting for the industry to come to me itself and to tell me how I can help them.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>As is customary, this Bill contains amendments to various pension laws which have become necessary in order to enable the administration of pension matters to function more smoothly or to regulate the pension rights of certain bodies to better effect. This is a measure which may be discussed more profitably during the Committee Stage and on that occasion I shall furnish hon. Senators with any information concerning this matter which they may require. In the meantime I just want to point out briefly that the Bill deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with the elimination of the obstacles which have up to now prevented the widows of certain office-bearers from qualifying for pensions if they married their late spouses after the latter had ceased to hold the offices in question.</p>
<p>Some members of statutory bodies sometimes serve simultaneously on two or more statutory bodies. In such cases it is frequently difficult, as matters stand at present, to determine the salary on the basis of which their pension benefits ought to be calculated, and the requirement that they should be in the full-time service of the statutory body concerned also gives rise to problems. The calculation of pension bene fits in such cases on the basis of only one of the salaries received by the person in question must of necessity produce a result which falls considerably short of the total remuneration which such a person received immediately prior to his retirement, and consequently leaves him in an unenviable financial position. Clauses 2 and 4 are aimed at solving the problems which are being experienced in this connection.</p>
<p>Members of the Associated Institutions Provident Fund are often appointed or transferred to posts in the Public Service. Such persons are, in terms of existing legislation, required to become members of the Government Service Pension Fund and to contribute to that fund in respect of their previous pensionable service. The amounts standing to their credit in the Associated Institutions Provident Fund are often inadequate to pay the sums required by the Government Service Pension Fund for the purposes of recognizing such previous pensionable service.</p>
<p>A solution to the problem would be to allow such people to retain their membership of the Associated Institutions Provident Fund and to continue to be members of that fund as if they had not been transferred to another fund. Clauses 5 and 6 will provide the necessary machinery to give effect to such a solution.</p>
<p>As hon. Senators will observe from clause 8, an important change is being contemplated in that the gratuities payable to female members of Parliament will, if the relative clause becomes law, be paid to their estates in the event of their dying before such gratuity can be paid to them.</p>
<p>*When the Parliamentary Service and Administrators Pensions Act was passed in 1971, it was the intention that members of Parliament who had formerly been members of a provincial council, could in certain prescribed circumstances elect to count half of their service as provincial councillors for the purposes of the parliamentary pension scheme. However, the period during which provincial councillors are required to contribute to provincial pension schemes has since been reduced from 20 to 12 years, with the result that former provincial councillors, by virtue of the definition of &#x201C;pensionable service&#x201D; in the various ordinances in terms of which only periods during which contributions were paid are included, may cause no more than six years of their service to be thus counted. This was never the intention, and this matter is now being rectified.</p>
<p>In terms of section 110(l)(a) of the Water Act, 1956, water boards may, <i>inter alia</i>, take over waterworks from local authorities. Such take-overs are normally accompanied by the take-over of the staff involved in such a project and consequently provision has to be made for their pension rights. This is now being done in clause 10, which in brief amounts to the pension rights in the existing pension fund of a staff member thus transferred being transferred to the Government Service Pension Fund and any shortfall which may arise in such a transfer having to be borne by the water board concerned. This arrangement ensures that such a staff member will not lose his previous pensionable service.</p>
<p>As has already been said, I think that the Bill can receive further attention during the Committee Stage.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#scheepers">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I am very pleased to say that we support this legislation. I think this legislation is an improvement, firstly, because a person who holds down more than one job and who has more than one interest can only belong to one fund. As far as the Provident Fund is concerned, I think the hon. the Minister has acted quite correctly because there are certain employees who, because they belong to a provident fund, have built their entire existence around that fund. Perhaps they have bought a house that they want to pay off and that is why it is a good thing that they have a choice in this connection should they want to remain members. They have to make up their minds within 90 days, a period which I think is quite long enough to afford them an opportunity of deciding what they want to do.</p>
<p>I am pleased to see that in terms of clause 8 a gratuity owing to a female member will in future be paid into her estate. That is still not completely satisfactory but it is a step in the right direction, Sir, and I trust that all discrimination against female members or women in the Public Service will soon be completely abolished.</p>
<p>As far as the person who applies for a pension is concerned, it is now provided that it can be made retrospective for a period of six months. That, too, is a sound principle that is being introduced in this legislation.</p>
<p>I regard it as important that in terms of the provisions of clause 10 if an estate is insolvent and has to be sequestrated, benefits will not be considered as forming part of the assets in such insolvent estate.</p>
<p>As far as transfers from local authorities to the Water Board are concerned, I think that too is a sound principle.</p>
<p>With these few words, Sir, we on this side of the House express our support for the Bill and, if there are no requests to the contrary we shall not ask for the Bill to be committed.</p>

<p>That is why I should like to go on, Sir. I shall ignore the remark &#x201C;age before beauty&#x201D;.</p>
<p>It is very gratifying and interesting to find that since yesterday there has been such a fine spirit of co-operation and unanimity in this hon. House in respect of the Bills we have had before us. It reminded me of those beautiful words of David: &#x201C;Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together &#x2026;&#x201D; In this case, it is especially applicable to the person who spoke just before me and I want to say to that hon. Senator: &#x201C;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brother and sister to dwell together.&#x201D; We agree as far as these matters are concerned and I agree with everything she has said; neither will I repeat certain points she has raised, particularly those with which I agree.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as this Bill deals with what have been called &#x201C;konsekwensiële regulasies&#x201D; (consequential regulations)&#x2014;I think by the hon. Senator Swanepoel&#x2014;I merely want to say that I regard them as &#x201C;gevolglike en voortvloeiende regulasies&#x201D; which, I think, is better Afrikaans. But in so far as we are dealing with them here, they are all regulations and changes which are very important in respect of our pensions legislation. In fact, there is not much more one can say in connection with this Bill than what the hon. the Minister has already said, and neither do I want to repeat what he said.</p>
<p>We are dealing here with pension improvements and improved benefits for some people who have been asking for them for a long time; with fair treatment for those who deserve it; with simplified administration in the granting of pensions; and finally, improvements that are being brought about that have long been necessary.</p>
<p>The improvements are those that practical experience in the past has shown to be essential and we are very grateful to the department and the hon. the Minister for having noticed this and for having come forward with this timely and very practical legislation.

<p>Mr. President, I want to thank hon. Senators wholeheartedly for supporting this Bill. It does away with anomalies. This is legislation in respect of which certain matters usually come to our notice in the course of the parliamentary session and sometimes we have to do a fairly rush job to rectify matters. I am grateful to the hon. Senators for the spirit they have displayed. These are not contentious matters. The whole objective underlying this legislation is simply to put matters right that were not right; in other words, matters that were not right as far as individuals were concerned. It has nothing to do with politics, as hon. Senators know. Consequently I am grateful to the hon. Senators Dr. Scheepers, Fick and</p>
<p>Winchester for supporting the Second Reading.</p>

<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>
<p>Clause 9:</p>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise in regard to this clause. I am sure that if the hon. the Minister will apply his mind to what I have to say he will realize that it is most reasonable. The clause empowers the Secretary to back-date a pension six months after the date of application. This is something to be welcomed. But what I should like to draw to the attention of the hon. the Minister is this: It is all very well for the Secretary to have that discretionary power to back-date a pension six months after the date of application but in many instances it will be found that it takes some time after a person has been injured&#x2014;we are now dealing with military pensions&#x2014;for the doctors to determine the extent of that injury. Say, for instance, a person suffers a head injury. The hon. the Minister is a doctor and he knows better than I do what the consequences of that can be. If a person suffers a head injury it may, in fact, take a considerable time before the extent of that person&#x2019;s injury becomes known. What I am asking the hon. the Minister, in fact, is to bring this clause into line with, say, the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. One has two years within which to formulate a claim under the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will accept an amendment changing the six months to, say, 24 months? I do not think what I am asking is unreasonable. The hon. the Minister, as a medical man, will know full well what the merits of my argument are. I know from my own personal experience the difficulties that can arise. I had, for instance, to deal with the pension of a military man. He committed suicide ten years after the end of his military service. At the inquest the magistrate&#x2019;s finding was to the effect that the person had committed suicide as a result of his war experience. The family involved here could suffer very severe hardship in the interim. In the case which I dealt with the application was put in and the pension was granted but not retrospectively. In other words, it took ten years for the injury or damage to manifest itself. I am not asking for any period as long as that. I am simply saying to the hon. the Minister that my experience in regard to Motor Vehicle Insurance Act claims in the past has been that it can take a considerable length of time before the doctors can determine the extent of the injury. Therefore I think that six months seems a very limiting factor. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not agree to give the Secretary the discretionary power to accept or back-date claims for a period longer than six months. If he were to make it 12 months I would be much happier. I would be even happier with 24 months which would bring it more or less into line with the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. I should like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s arguments in this respect.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#henderson">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">C. C. HENDERSON</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the argument in this case that where an application has been approved the period of back-dating should be longer than six months. The hon. Senator Winchester has stated that a precedent exists in so far as the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act is concerned. I think most of us have probably had the experience of people who have suffered war injuries. In many cases they are not even aware of the right of their claim. These injuries take a long time to show their effect. Some people are even reluctant to apply for a pension until the effects become really severe. I think there is a cast-iron case to be made out for granting this extra relief. There must be many men and some women in this country who have suffered war injuries and whose injuries only show when they begin to get older. In some cases they only apply for these pensions or benefits through the ex-servicemen&#x2019;s organizations and this all takes time. By the time the man applies, he may well in fact have been entitled to this sort of pension for far longer than the six months referred to. In all fairness, therefore, I do believe that the hon. the Minister should have another look at this provision, accept the precedent of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act and allow these pensions to be back-dated by 24 months instead of six months, or at least by a longer period than the six months, preferably for 24 months.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I too want to thank the hon. the Minister because all improvements are necessary and this legislation, as he has introduced it, is definitely a great improvement.</p>
<p>While we are discussing it, I should like some information in respect of one aspect. It is not specifically referred to in this legislation but it does generally arise. It came to our notice recently that the pension boards that used to exist in the past have been abolished.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to have complied with the request to effect such an amendment, but in military matters the delays usually occur in the event of death. In the event of all other injuries and mishaps, proper records are kept and there is an arrangement with the military authorities that such cases should be expedited. These proper records that are kept according to the efficient structure of military matters, make six months more than enough. The longer the delay, the more difficult it becomes to determine the real facts. As far as I am concerned, motor-car insurance is not really comparable in this case because in the case of motor insurance proper records are not always kept and the proceedings may stretch over a long period. In view of the fact that we have a very efficient machine in this regard and an arrangement with the authorities that these matters should be expedited, and in view of the fact that previously only one month was allowed, I feel that I cannot just summarily decide on a longer period. I will therefore have to adhere to the present arrangements.</p>

<p>I could not hear that, Sir. Mr. Chairman, I accept that, as the hon. the Minister has said, good records are kept by the military authorities. In the normal course of events this is so but, as the hon. Senator Henderson pointed out, sometimes it takes time&#x2014;I am talking about injuries and not death&#x2014;for an injury to manifest itself or the seriousness of an injury to manifest itself. When it comes to the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, what actually happens is that the injured person puts in his claim but the medical men themselves are not prepared to pass judgment on the severity or the extent of the claim because they maintain that it takes time for certain injuries to manifest themselves so as to be able to determine how seriously the man is injured, whether it is 50% or 75% or whatever. As I mentioned to the hon. the Minister, Sir, a head injury is specifically such an example because a person may receive a head wound in a military operation and the doctors themselves are unwilling to determine the extent or the total effect of such an injury for some considerable time. In due course the injured person puts in his claim for a pension, and that is fine. But what I am saying is that the period from the injury to the time when he puts in his claim might in fact be longer than the six months that the Secretary now has discretion for. It might in fact be 12 months, because of the doctors&#x2019; unwillingness to determine the extent of the injury or because they are perhaps unable to determine the extent of the injury. I am therefore putting it to the hon. the Minister that the period between the date of the injury and the date that the person puts his application in for a pension might well be a year or it could be two years, but the Secretary only has discretion to back-date that pension six months. The family of the person concerned might be in dire financial straits and have fallen seriously into debt while the extent of the injury was being determined one way or the other, or the severity of the injury was being determined. I know that the hon. the Minister is most reasonable in regard to these matters. I am not having a fight with him about it but am merely trying to put the case as best I can. So far I seem to have not put it as well as I should have. But I hope the hon. the Minister understands the point I am making. I am asking him to allow the Secretary to have a longer discretion than just six months.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-social-welfare">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, because of practical considerations the Secretary and the department do not consider it necessary to have a longer period than six months. The hon. Senator must understand that it is not a question of the extent of the injury. The amount of compensation may be altered from time to time. This is merely giving notice of the event and of the fact that a person is entitled to a pension. That is important. But the extent and the on-going process and so forth are not under discussion here. It might even be advisable not to wait two years but to let the authorities know as soon as possible that an injury has occurred, as in the case of insurance, for instance. But the on-going process of determining the eventual compensation is not affected here.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#henderson">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">C. C. HENDERSON</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister has stated that the military authorities have records of all injuries. I only wish that that was so because experience has shown that in many cases there is an argument as to the origin of the injury, viz. whether it was strictly on war service, whether it was an injury associated with war service or not associated with war service. In fact, from the very nature of war it is very often not possible to maintain proper records. I am now referring particularly to the Second World War because there are still men from the Second World War who apply for pensions. I myself suffered an injury while training and when I get really old I might still apply for some assistance. However, the point is that that injury has so far not affected me in any material way but that the time may come when it does. I would be surprised if there is a record of my injury because it occurred early on in my training period. I am sure that the same applies in many other instances. I very much doubt whether the records are always available. Sometimes one has to appeal to a board to determine whether in fact the injury was associated with war service. This all takes time and I think the hon. the Minister should look at this period again.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that I have not been able to move the hon. the Minister in this respect because I feel very strongly about this point. I would vote against the clause but for the fact that it is an improvement and so I shall not do so. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I personally have appeared before a pensions tribunal to appeal in matters relating to war injuries. I have found them to be most reasonable and have no quarrel with them at all. But in many of the cases the people whom I tried to act for had sustained their injuries many years before and one of the difficulties the pensions tribunal experiences is that they cannot find records, as the hon. Senator Henderson has just mentioned. In this regard I want to give the hon. the Minister a classic example. A person may have been injured in a prisoner-of-war camp. There are no records in South Africa of how he received that injury. It is only when he returns to South Africa and is examined by the military doctors here that they come to a conclusion as to what sort of injury he has. But all the records and the details of how the injury occurred are in fact behind enemy lines. The records are therefore not really as up to date as one would like to see them. I am not quarrelling with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s officials or with the tribunals because they are limited in what they are empowered to do. In terms of this clause the Secretary is limited to back-dating a pension for six months. Even if he is the most sympathetic person in the world and in respect of a certain case he wants to make it longer than six months he cannot do so because his discretion is limited. He is the person who is being handicapped. I am not saying that he must back-date a pension six months or twenty-four months in every instance. What I am asking of the hon. the Minister is that he empower the Secretary to have a longer period in which he can exercise his discretion, so that if he wishes to make it longer than six months he will be able to do so. He may never do so, but I would like to see him have the power.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister probably overlooks the point I am trying to make. The point I am trying to stress is that the officials are sympathetic and would like to do more but their powers are limited in terms of this clause. I am merely asking that the Secretary be given wider discretionary powers so that if he wishes to back-date a pension for a year he can do so. Very often the families of these people, while they are waiting for the pensions to be worked out and for the injury to be properly assessed, suffer severe hardship. The back-dating of the pension would be a tremendous relief to these people. I am not asking for the moon. In fact, if the hon. the Minister will only meet us half-way and make the period 12 months instead of six months I shall be very grateful. I have often said that I am like Oliver Twist because whatever the hon. the Minister gives I will ask for more anyway. But I do believe we have made out a good case to make the period 12 months even if the hon. the Minister does not want to make it 24 months.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am being accommodating in this respect but the arguments advanced by the hon. Senator are not really valid. The example of a prisoner of war makes no difference to the argument. It makes no difference whether the period is six months, two years or five years. However, because the hon. Senator asked so nicely, I shall accept his amendment and make the period 12 months. I think one is entitled sometimes, in a spirit of goodwill, to accept such an amendment, although I do not think this amendment has any merit.

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The Government Employees Provident Fund was established in 1936 to make provision for temporary White employees in the Government&#x2019;s employ. The Government non-White Employees Pension Fund was established considerably later, viz. in 1966, in the mould of the aforementioned fund, to make provision for pensions for temporary non-White employees in Government employ.</p>
<p>Since then conditions have changed considerably, with the result that the provision made initially has been inadequate for a long time now. Consequently representations have been received over the years from various quarters for the improvement of the benefits of the people involved, and various efforts have been made to establish a better dispensation for these officials, but up to now the financial position of the two funds and the relatively large contributions required in order, for example, to absorb members of the funds into other pension funds, have made meaningful change impossible.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the members of the funds in question in the Government Service Pension Fund will, for example, according to the latest estimates, require an additional amount of over R91 million per annum in Government contributions alone and in some cases members&#x2019; contributions will have to be increased from 4% to 7%. This increased expenditure does not even make provision for the recognition of the previous service of the officials in question, and consequently does not fully reflect the financial implications such a transfer would entail.</p>
<p>An improvement of the two schemes is nevertheless deemed appropriate and consequently it has been decided to consolidate the two funds and to create a new fund in which all the existing and dormant members of the two funds can be absorbed. All members will contribute to the new fund at the rate of 5% of their salary while the Government will contribute to the fund in the proportion which will be stipulated from time to time.</p>
<p>I should just like to tell hon. Senators that these people are old road workers, forestry workers and people at the State diggings at Alexander Bay, many of whom have given a lifetime of service to the State. But they have never been in fulltime service. Most of them are non-White employees.</p>
<p>An annuity will be payable after 10 years&#x2019; service and after attainment of the age of 60 years in accordance with the following formula: <img src="eqn1.jpg"/></p>
<p>in which formula&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>A represents a member&#x2019;s annual pensionable remuneration as on his last work day;</li>
<li>B represents 30;</li>
<li>C represents the period of the member&#x2019;s pensionable service;</li>
<li>D represents 0,75; and</li>
<li>E represents R300.</li>
</ol>
<p>Briefly, what this amounts to is that a member can expect an annuity equalling more or less 75% of his salary after approximately 30 years&#x2019; service.</p>
<p>The new dispensation will mean that gratuities at present payable to members, will lapse.</p>
<p>Widows of members who have completed at least 10 years pensionable service, will on the death of their husbands be able to depend on an annuity equivalent to 50% of the pensions which their husbands received or would have received if they had not died but would have been entitled to an annuity on their death. A widow of a member with less than 10 years pensionable service will, on the death of her husband, receive an amount equal to the amount of the annual salary to which her husband was entitled upon his death.</p>
<p>Existing pensions, allowances and bonuses are being consolidated and will be paid out as consolidated pensions. In this regard it should be noted that pensions have been increased from time to time over the years and have just been increased by 10% with effect from 1 April 1979. In the process of consolidation, all these increases are now being combined, with the result that the consolidated pensions are for the most part considerably higher than the amounts for which those concerned initially qualified.</p>
<p>The new formula to be applied in future in paying annuities, will result in considerably improved benefits according to the period of service involved. For example, in the case of a person with 40 years service it could amount to as much as 100%, in the case of a person with 30 years service, as much as 94,16% and in the case of a person with 20 years service, as much as 77,34%, even if it is taken into account that they had previously qualified for a gratuity.</p>
<p>†Widows who formerly qualified for only 40% of their husbands&#x2019; pensions will now qualify for 50% of those pensions which will, of course, in view of the new formula be appreciably higher than they ever were. This must naturally mean a better pension for widows generally.</p>
<p>In addition, it has been possible to effect parity between the benefits payable to members of the several population groups while they will also be required to contribute to the new fund at the same rate.</p>
<p>The new deal is, generally speaking, an appreciable improvement on the existing one and should bring considerable relief to most temporary employees. It will naturally involve additional expenditure by employers as well as by those members who have up till now contributed at a rate of less than 5% of their salaries.</p>
<p>Particulars of the new scheme are, as hon. Senators will observe, not set out in the Bill now before the hon. Senate. The Bill now before the Senate deals briefly with:</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) the termination of the existing two funds;</li>
<li>(b) the establishment of a new fund and the transfer of the assets of the existing funds to the new fund;</li>
<li>(c) the consolidation of existing benefits as earlier explained by me;</li>
<li>(d) the regulation of the membership of the new fund; and</li>
<li>(e) the regulation of benefits payable to dormant members of the existing funds.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, it seeks to clothe the Minister with the requisite authority to regulate the new scheme by way of regulation as has now become the practice in matters of this nature. Full details of the new scheme will accordingly be set out in the regulations which will be promulgated under clause 8 of the Bill. Section 17 of the Interpretation Act, 1957, requiring the tabling of a list of proclamations and Government notices promulgated by the Minister naturally will apply also to regulations promulgated under the aforementioned clause with the result that the promulgation of such regulations will, of course, be brought to the attention of this hon. Senate.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am very pleased that this legislation makes provision for less privileged people in particular. I think that everyone who has helped to develop our country is entitled to a pension the day he retires. As the hon. the Minister has explained, the group concerned comprise the less-privileged people in the employ of the State. There is one point that I wish to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister. There is usually a great deal of confusion when a provident fund is converted into a pension fund and I think the position should be put clearly to these people. Many of them are not highly educated and cannot understand involved language. I think these people should be informed in simple language what new benefits are inherent in this for them.</p>
<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister one question and that is in connection with certain retired members who will not be able to join the fund. The other funds to which they belong are now being abolished by this Bill and I should like to know what is to become of the contributions that they have paid into them. With these few words, Sir, we express our support for this legislation.</p>
<p>There is one further point I want to mention and that is that only widows are mentioned here; no reference is made to dependants. I think the time has arrived for the hon. the Minister to have the question of discrimination against females investigated. I think that in that respect we as a democratic country and as one that is regarded as being the most advanced country in Africa ought to set an example. I think that if we treat our women so badly as to withhold certain benefits from them, it will definitely count against us.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. L. ODENDAAL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, permit me at the outset to address a special word of welcome to the Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions who is present here. He has now been promoted to membership of the Public Service Commission. I cannot omit to refer with great appreciation on behalf of hon. Senators on this side of the House to the many years of selfless and dedicated service of Mr. Van Vuuren in this capacity. We have learned to know him these past years, we know his activities and we are aware of the special progress in the field of welfare services that has taken place under his control as Secretary. We wish him a very pleasant task ahead.</p>
<p>One could reasonably expect the hon. Opposition not to have any objection to this legislation. In fact, it is of such a positive and realistic nature that it must of necessity be generally welcome. The principles and objectives of the legislation are obviously in the best interests of temporary workers of the State of whom, I believe, there are approximately 23 000. The consolidation of the two particular funds, to which I shall refer in a moment, is also welcome because it will ensure one strong fund. The consolidation of the pensions and annuities into one improved pension also welcomed as this will ensure that husband and wife, contrary to past practice, will be assured of an income on which they can live for the rest of their lives. Previously the annuities&#x2014;as we know this always happens&#x2014;were soon spent and then people in those circumstances experienced problems. Other methods had then to be employed to provide them with some means of support.</p>
<p>Without being repetitive, I should like to lay stress on a few particular provisions of this Bill because I think they are of special interest. Firstly, the widow of such an employee will in future receive 50% of the improved pension. Another special provision is that if she remarries, she will retain this pension. Not all widows are as fortunate as the one I know of. This widow was married consecutively to three officials. All three of them died, and eventually she received three pensions. This provision ensures that the widow of such an official will at least be assured of a reasonable living.</p>
<p>I also want to stress that one can feel happy in regard to the state of these two special funds at the end of 1977 as reflected in the latest report of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. The Government Employees Provident Fund&#x2014;a long name&#x2014;for Whites at the end of last year stood at R69,694 million. The Government non-White Employees Pension Fund stood at R85,319 million. When one adds these two together, it comes to approximately R155 million. This is an ever-increasing and very strong reserve and will in future be very usefully and very positively employed.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the provisions of this Bill will undoubtedly bring about a reassuring and encouraging improvement in the existing position. It will put an end to the many problems, heartbreak stories and sad cases to which we have all had to listen at some stage of our lives and with which we have been involved. I think this Bill should be warmly welcomed from all sides and we give it our wholehearted support.</p>

Dormant members&#x2019; benefits are paid to them when they retire. They receive 5% interest, but they can invest the money themselves.</p>
<p>I want to associate myself with the tribute paid by the hon. Senator Odendaal to Mr. Van Vuuren. Even if this is not the time&#x2014;this is normally done during the Minister&#x2019;s Vote and I have already done in the Other Place&#x2014;I want to confirm everything the hon. Senator Odendaal has said. It is so much more apt in this case. In this hon. Senate I should also like to convey my special thanks to Mr. Van Vuuren for the many years of outstanding service he has rendered. I wish him everything of the best in the years ahead.</p>

<p>The Professional Engineers&#x2019; Amendment Bill was referred to a Select Committee before Second Reading primarily because in terms of the amending Bill the provisions of the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Act, Act No. 81 of 1968, would also be applicable to companies and other juristic persons performing work which in terms of section 7(3)(c) of the said Professional Engineers&#x2019; Act is reserved for professional engineers, and certain companies and juristic persons that do not comply with the prescriptions would consequently be prevented from performing work which is thus reserved and would consequently be deprived of their livelihood.</p>
<p>Since the Select Committee was unable to complete its work before Parliament was prorogued at the end of the 1978 session, a commission of inquiry was appointed to complete the work of the Select Committee. All the recommendations of the commission of inquiry have been included in the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Amendment Bill which was read a first time on Thursday, 10 May 1979.</p>
<p>As far as the engineering profession is concerned, I want to point out that a number of highly trained and competent persons with extensive experience in the various branches of the engineering profession have, under the direction of the S.A. Council for Professional Engineers, been trying for a number of years since the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Act, Act No. 81 of 1968, was promulgated, to compile a comprehensive minimum tariff of fees for the calculation of professional fees for the engineering profession. Owing to the diversity of the various branches and of the activities within each separate branch the committee in question was unable to succeed in devising a minimum tariff of fees which was infallible in all respects. It was found that owing to the enormous diversity of activities it was not possible to formulate a tariff which would not result in either an overpayment for one activity or an underpayment for another. As far as the engineering profession is concerned, practical experience has consequently shown that realistic terms can only be determined if this is done with reference to a basic tariff of fees and with due regard for the requirements unique to each individual commission. For these reasons it was consequently decided merely to prescribe a tariff of fees in the case of the engineering profession in terms of which a client and engineer could negotiate for an appropriate remuneration for a specific commission.</p>
<p>The most important principle amendments contained in the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Amendment Bill consist of the following&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(i) To make provision for the abolition of the Professional Advisory Committees that have to be constituted in accordance with the provisions contained in section 12(1)(b) of the Act. Experience has shown that owing to the wide field covered by each engineering profession, the Professional Advisory Committees, each of which, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, consist of five members, cannot be constituted in such a way that the committee is an authority on every facet of the engineering field which it represents. The Professional Advisory Committees, as they are constituted at present, are frequently faced with situations which they cannot cope with. However, the work of the aforesaid committees can be dealt with equally effectively by committees appointed by the S.A. Council for Professional Engineers in terms of section 10 of the Act. This will also enable the council to define the terms of reference and the constitution of each committee according to the particular requirements of the branch of engineering which it represents.</li>
<li>(ii) To provide that companies or other juristic persons, in the same way as natural persons, will be liable to penalties under the Act if they perform work for remuneration which is reserved for professional engineers in terms of section 7(3)(c) without their having obtained exemption from the provisions of the Act.</li>
</ol>
<p>The primary object of the Act is the regulation of the engineering profession in the interests of the public. At present the provisions of the Act are only applicable to natural persons and, according to legal opinion obtained, the provisions are not applicable to companies or other juristic persons. Companies and other juristic persons that perform work for remuneration which is reserved for professional engineers are therefore able to contravene the Act without any danger of a prosecution being instituted against them, by&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) allowing natural persons in their employment to do engineering work for which such persons are not qualified;</li>
<li>(b) doing work at a lower tariff than the minimum tariff of fees prescribed for professional engineers and in that way supplanting the latter;</li>
<li>(c) canvassing for work in conflict with the professional code of conduct or performing any other act which is in conflict with the prescribed code of conduct;</li>
<li>(d) practising as companies with limited liability as a result of which their clients find themselves in an unfavourable bargaining position if the company should fail to meet its obligations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The object is therefore to eliminate these loopholes in the Act by&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) amplifying the definition of a &#x201C;person&#x201D; to include juristic persons as well; and</li>
<li>(b) amending the Act in such a way that it will be possible to exempt juristic persons who for practical reasons cannot register as professional engineers in terms of the Act, from the provisions of the Act, subject to compliance with certain conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>(iii) The amendment of section 31 of the Act is being envisaged to extend the exemption in terms of the Act so that it may also be applicable to juristic persons. However, since companies cannot comply with all the requirements such as academic qualifications etc., a company may, if it complies with conditions which will in due course be published in the <i>Gazette</i> in terms of subsection (2) of section 31, apply to be exempted from the provisions of the Act so as to be able to practice lawfully as engineers.</p>
<p>In order to afford companies and other juristic persons an adequate opportunity to comply with the provisions of the Act, these provisions will come into operation as from a date to be announced by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>
<p>(iv) To make provision for the establishment of boards of control to enable persons who do professional work closely associated with or allied to the work reserved for professional engineers, and for which an academic training is required, to have a say on the council. This provision will also be enabling in the sense that the members of any profession who wish to establish a control board must set their own house in order by organizing their members into an institute or association before it will be possible to proceed to the establishment of a board of control. A board of control will be autonomous in regard to the arrangement of matters affecting its own members. To ensure that there will be mutual co-operation between the South African Council for Professional Engineers and any board of control on matters of common interest, provision is being made for joint representation on the boards in question.</p>
<p>(v) In order to place the engineering profession in States which formed part of the Republic prior to their independence, on a sound basis from the outset, a new section 31A is being added to the Act with the object, should a State so prefer, of making the Act applicable to such a State as well.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the select committee that was appointed last year which was converted into a commission went into this matter very thoroughly indeed and the result is the Bill that is before us which I think improves the original Act very considerably, or will do so when it is passed. The hon. the Minister has given us details of the measure before us. It is comprehensive, it deals with the question of why minimum fees have been done away with and why a guide is now incorporated instead. In fact, there are only a few new principles involved which the hon. the Minister has pointed out to us. There are, of course, the various clauses that deal with the closing of loopholes in the present legislation and these provisions are to be welcomed.</p>
<p>The provision for the establishment of boards of control for the various professions which fall under the auspices of the professional engineers is to be welcomed, because it means that they can do their own household chores and control their own affairs to a certain degree under the control of the council itself. For this reason, we on these benches, the official Opposition, will support the Bill before us.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#o'connell">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I am right in saying that I believe this is the first occasion on which the hon. the Minister has appeared here in his new capacity as Minister of Public Works. From this side of the House we should like to congratulate him on his participation in today&#x2019;s proceedings.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, quite rightly the hon. Senator Bozas lent his support to the Bill on behalf of the Opposition for which we are grateful. He says that the Bill has received the very thorough consideration of the commission appointed to investigate the whole matter and that it does not require an in-depth debate. However, there are a few aspects which I should like to take the opportunity of raising, being the only professional engineer present today.</p>
<p>I would say at the outset, Sir, that the essence of this Bill represents the coming-of-age of the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Council and at the same time its assumption of increased responsibilities and powers. To me as an engineer this very aspect reflects and symbolizes the dignity and statue of the profession. A question that one might now give consideration to is that of a suitable professional title. This is a matter that we as engineers have discussed and reflected upon in the past. In Europe the common title for an engineer is doctor, but foreigners in Europe who, by virtue of the academic titles preferred in their land of origin, defer from taking the title of doctor in Europe are referred to by the common title of engineer as a prefix to their surnames. In the English-speaking world, following the British and American practice, the title &#x201C;engineer&#x201D; has historically been used too loosely and does not convey that sense of dignity to which this senior profession is really entitled. However, Sir, the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Act does establish a basis for the increasing degree of self-oriented administration that is now being assumed by the profession. The standard of entry to the profession can now be controlled, and one may well look forward to a future in which the word engineer will convey that sense of professional dignity to which it is entitled.</p>
<p>A second aspect that I would like to refer to is that according to the S.A. Yearbook for 1978, some 13% of the engineering profession practise on their own behalf. This is of particular significance as the greater part of the requirements of the Act and the amendments to the Act by virtue of the Bill now before the House, is applicable solely to the engineer in private practice, for instance, in regard to touting, fee cutting, unfair competition etc. On the other hand, Sir, it would appear from statistics that the bulk of engineers in South Africa are employed in private practice. The consulting engineering profession carries the responsibility of maintaining for the whole of the profession in South Africa the highest ethical and professional standards. In South Africa the consulting engineer fulfils the very great needs of our own infrastructure as well as those of quasi-government institutions and to a very great extent those of the infrastructural development of the developing states in the Southern African hinterland. In my view the consulting engineer is not always given full recognition in this regard by all the central Government departments, and I must make use of this opportunity to put this fact to the hon. the Minister. I feel that this section of the profession needs to be protected by means of an equitable and fair distribution of work. The work distribution must not be controlled by the influence of individuals but by some other system. By this process of the equitable distribution of the work, the consulting profession will be encouraged to do further research, to specialize, to computerize and to make a study of all the tools necessary for the very important advances in design technology that we require in this country to keep up with developments in the rest of the world. Indeed, Sir, I would suggest that a fresh look at the consulting engineer&#x2019;s practice with a view to examining its relationship to the needs of the central Government, the methods adopted for allocating work and the incentives for encouraging engineers to practise in foreign countries are factors that should be given urgent attention.</p>
<p>Mr. President, may I take up the time of this hon. House for one further moment to point out that the consulting engineer, in his journeys across the world, has access to countries, by virtue of his profession, to which probably nobody else in South Africa has access. I can quote from personal experience. The engineer is a great ambassador for this country because he has access to overseas countries solely because he can sell his labour there and because that labour and his knowledge are commodities needed by those countries. I maintain therefore that we need assistance for and support of our engineers. In my view there is a great discrepancy in this regard that calls for the careful attention of the Government.</p>
<p>The third aspect to which I would like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention is that although we now have this Professional Engineers&#x2019; Act which regularizes the code of ethics, standards of procedure etc. of the engineer, the infringements of the Act apply solely to engineers in private practice. In South Africa we have the S.A. Association of Consulting Engineers which has its own code of ethics and professional standards. Notwithstanding the fact that these generally duplicate the ethics and standards set out in the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Act, they are applied separately whether or not the requirements of the said Act are invoked.</p>
<p>Finally, Sir, we in this profession are grateful to the hon. the Minister for the interest he has displayed and continues to display in our profession. We are also grateful for the steps taken in this Bill to provide the Professional Engineers&#x2019; Council with greater autonomy that can but lead to better and higher professional standards and increased dignity for the profession as a whole. We on this side of the House heartily support the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I wish to thank the hon. Senator Bozas for his and his party&#x2019;s support of this Bill. I take it that the other party in opposition also supports the Bill. I also wish to thank the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell for his congratulations upon my appearance in my new capacity in this hon. House. I listened with great interest to what the hon. Senator had to say, especially in regard to the standing of the profession as such. May I just point out to him that the Council for Professional Engineers has decided on the title &#x201C;professional engineer&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;professionele ingenieur&#x201D;. It is interesting though that in some Latin-American countries one finds that a professional man who has completed four years at a university and has obtained a degree is allowed to use the title of &#x201C;doctor&#x201D;, whether he obtained his degree in law, engineering or any other professional subject. I think there is a lot to be said for the fact that an engineer should have a particular title. I agree with the Council for Professional Engineers, which prefers the word or the title &#x201C;professional engineer&#x201D; as an identification.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I do not want to deal further with the interesting thoughts raised by the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell, except to thank him and other hon. Senators for their support of this Bill.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill now be read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The Architects&#x2019; Amendment Bill [B. 31 of 1978] was referred to a Select Committee before Second Reading mainly because in terms of the Bill the provisions of the Architects&#x2019; Act, 1970 (Act No. 35 of 1970), would become applicable to companies and juristic persons who perform work which is reserved for architects in terms of section 7(3)(c) of the Act, and certain companies and juristic persons who do not comply with the provisions of the Act would thus be prevented from carrying out the work which is reserved for architects and would accordingly be deprived of their livelihood.</p>
<p>Because the Select Committee could not complete its work before Parliament was prorogued at the end of the 1978 session, a commission of inquiry was appointed to complete the work of the Select Committee. Apart from one exception, namely the recom- mendation that the Minister should prescribe a &#x201C;tariff of fees&#x201D; instead of a &#x201C;minimum fee&#x201D; according to which architects should calculate their fees for their professional services, all the other recommendations of the commission of inquiry have been incorpo- rated in the Architects&#x2019; Amendment Bill [B. 82&#x2014;&#x2019;79] which was read for the First Time on Thursday, 10 May 1979 in the Other Place.</p>
<p>The reason why the commission of inquiry proposed that the Act be amended so that a &#x201C;tariff of fees&#x201D; instead of a &#x201C;minimum fee&#x201D; as at present stipulated by the Act, should apply, stems from the fact that according to a legal opinion which was presented to the commission, the client was contractually obliged to pay an architect the full prescribed minimum fee irrespective of whether the architect renders a full professional service or not Legal opinions which became available after the commission completed its work, however, indicate without doubt that a client and an architect may agree to reduce the minimum fee proportionally in accordance with the service the architect renders.</p>
<p>The view is held that remuneration calcu- lated according to a &#x201C;minimum fee&#x201D; encour- ages competition among architects on the basis of expertise and quality of service which is in the interests of the client in particular and of the profession in general, but that remuneration calculated according to a &#x201C;tariff of fees&#x201D; can lead to unhealthy competition among architects in regard to the tariff at which such remuneration for professional fees is calculated, and this will inevitably lead to a lowering of the standard of the service rendered. In view of the foregoing and the latest legal opinions referred to and the serious objections to the commission&#x2019;s recommendations made by the South African Council for Architects, the Cabinet decided to retain the present principle of having a &#x201C;minimum fee&#x201D; as provided for in the Architects&#x2019; Act, 1970 (Act No. 35 of 1970).</p>
<p>Mr. President, the most important principle changes which have been incorporated in the Architects&#x2019; Amendment Bill are&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(i) To provide that companies and juristic persons, just as natural persons, will be punishable in terms of the Act should they perform remunerative work which is reserved for architects in terms of section 7(3)(c) without having obtained exemption from the provisions of the Act. The Architects&#x2019; Act is primarily aimed at regulating the architects profession in the public interest. At present the Act only applies to natural persons and, according to legal opinion obtained, does not apply to companies or juristic persons. Companies and other juristic persons who perform work reserved for architects for remuneration can, therefore, without any fear of prosecution, contravene the Act by&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(a) allowing natural persons in their employ to perform architectural work for which they are not qualified;</li>
<li>(b) carrying out work at a lower fee than the minimum fees prescribed for architects and in so doing compete unfairly with architects;</li>
<li>(c) touting for work and perform other acts in contravention of the code of professional conduct which applies to architects;</li>
<li>(d) practising as companies with limited liability and when such companies fail to meet their commitments the clients find themselves in a weak position with no recourse.</li>
</ol></li></ol>
<p>It is accordingly proposed to put a stop to such malpractices by&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) extending the definition of a person to include juristic persons;</li>
<li>(b) amending the Act so that juristic persons who for practical purposes cannot register as architects in terms of the Act, can, subject to compliance with certain conditions, be exempted from some of the provisions of the Act.</li>
</ol>
<p>(ii) The amendment of section 31A of the Act which at present applies to natural persons only, is proposed m order to make the provisions applicable to juristic persons as well. As companies cannot in all respects comply with the provisions laid down for natural persons such as academic qualifications, etc., the provisions of the relevant section have been extended to enable juristic persons to obtain exemption from the provisions of the Act subject to such conditions as will be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> in terms of subsection 2 of section 31 A.</p>
<p>In order to give companies and other juristic persons ample opportunity to comply with the Act, the relevant provisions will only come into operation on a date which will be determined by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Government Gazette.</i></p>
<p>(iii) To provide for the establishment of boards of control in order to give persons who perform professional work which is related or allied to the work reserved for architects and for which academic training is required, representation at meetings of the Council.</p>
<p>This provision will also authorize the members of any profession who establish a board of control to get their house in order by means of organizing the members as an institute or organization before the establishment of a board of control. A board of control will be autonomous as far as regulating the affairs of its members is concerned. To ensure that there will be co-operation between the South African Council for Architects and a board of control regarding matters of common interest, provision is made for reciprocal representation on the Council and boards.</p>
<p>(iv) In order to put the architects&#x2019; profession on a sound basis in states which were formerly part of the Republic, a new section 31C has been introduced so that the Act can also be made applicable to that state if it so wishes.</p>
<p>Mr. President, this covers the most important principle amendments as proposed in the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the legislation before us has been inquired into very searchingly by a Select Committee and I therefore do not feel that it is necessary for me to go very deeply into the matter. However, I wish to say that architects provide a very valuable service to the community and have a great responsibility to the community as such. It is indeed necessary therefore that they should be controlled. We must ensure that people who are not qualified are precluded from doing work of this nature and causing their clients a great deal of loss.</p>
<p>When it comes to buildings, it may be just a humble home or it may be a massive structure like a skyscraper in Johannesburg. Such a building will most probably be one of the greatest investments that a man or a body of persons will make during his lifetime or during the existence of the corporate body. The architect, like the professional engineer and the quantity surveyor, will be intimately involved in ensuring that this building is of the best.</p>
<p>It is necessary therefore that the professions should be properly controlled and the legislation before us seeks to do just that. It closes the loopholes which existed in the previous legislation and will ensure that the profession is able to regulate itself in a proper manner in the future. For that reason we support the legislation and have no objection to its passage through this House without being committed.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I should like to associate myself with the statement of the hon. Senator Bozas regarding the importance of the architectural profession and the mutual relationship among the three respective professions. I think he said quite rightly that the matter had been thoroughly investigated by the commission. They have done good work and it is therefore not necessary to discuss the matter at length here.</p>
<p>You will permit me, Sir, to express two or three brief thoughts about the architect. Firstly, I want to say that I find it pleasing that the opportunity has arisen here for the architectural profession as a whole to be reviewed. I believe that the South African architectural profession has become known in various parts of the world for the high standards it upholds and I believe that South Africa can be very proud of this profession. Time does not allow me to elaborate on this, but I should like to point out to this hon. Senate that the architectural profession, that is, those in private practice, are as a whole undergoing a difficult time because of the recession experienced these past two years in the building industry. The moderate economic recovery presently being experienced, as well as the expectations for the immediate future in this respect, will not in my opinion bring sufficient relief because of the fact that there is a time lapse between the economic upswing and the improvement in the building industry.</p>
<p>This time lapse is due to the fact that the production sectors of the economy have a surplus capacity at the moment, and until the surplus capacity has been fully used up, it is not possible for further large expansion to take place. This matter in itself could occasion a discussion in depth, but I do think quite rightly that it is not fitting to discuss it at this stage. I merely mention it.</p>
<p>I want to leave one thought with the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and this is a fitting occasion on which to do so because he has spoken of the weal and woe of the architect&#x2014;that the position of the architectural profession must be kept in mind so that as much help as possible can be given to this profession by awarding as much of the planning as can be undertaken to the private architect</p>
<p>As the hon. Senator Bozas said, this situation also affects the other two profession, viz. the structural engineers, in fact the whole engineering profession as far as the building industry is concerned, and, of course, the quantity surveyors. The three professions are mutually dependent upon one another, and what adversely affects the one profession will have a negative effect on the other as well. But notwithstanding the spirit of my foregoing remarks, I should like on behalf of the three respective professions to thank the hon. the Minister once again for this degree of interest and for the regulation of the whole profession which is now being effected through the legislation before the hon. Senators. We on this side of the House give our support to the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I thank hon. Senators for their support and contributions to the discussion of this legislation. As the hon. Senator Bozas has said, the architectural profession provides a very useful service to society. I also want to refer to the last idea expressed by the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell. He said we must remember that the position of the architect has deteriorated over the past few years because of the economic recession, and that the architectural profession has been going through a difficult time. That is so. I am very well aware of this and I can assure the hon. Senator that in the past few months since I have occupied this post, I have had discussions with leading members of the profession who have brought the seriousness of the situation to my attention.</p>
<p>I can tell the hon. Senator that as far as the allocation of work by the Department of Public Works is concerned, we award approximately 92% of our major building programmes to private contractors. In the nature of things these are private professional practising engineers, architects and quantity surveyors who are commissioned to do professional work. I just want to give hon. Senators the assurance that the public sector is fully alive to the problem; we are fully aware of the special contribution the architectural profession makes to the general building programme in South Africa, and on our part we do everything in our power to see that these three professions receive a very fair share of the public building programme.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The Quantity Surveyors&#x2019; Amendment Bill (B. 30 of 1978) was referred to a Select Committee before Second Reading chiefly because in terms of the amending Bill in question, the provisions of the Quantity Surveyors&#x2019; Act, 1970 (Act 36 of 1970) would also apply to companies and other corporate bodies performing work which was reserved in terms of section 7(3)(c) of the aforementioned Quantity Surveyors Act, and certain companies and corporate bodies which did not comply with the requirements would therefore be prohibited from performing work reserved for quantity surveyors and would consequently be deprived of their livelihood.</p>
<p>Since the Select Committee was unable to complete its work before Parliament was prorogued at the end of the 1978 session, a commission of inquiry was appointed to complete the work of the Select Committee. With one exception, namely the recommendation that a &#x201C;tariff of fees&#x201D; instead of a &#x201C;minimum tariff of fees&#x201D; be prescribed by the Minister, in accordance with which quantity surveyors may calculate their remuneration for professional services, all the other recommendations of the commission of inquiry have been embodied in the Quantity Surveyors&#x2019; Amendment Bill that was read a first time on Thursday, 10 May 1979. The reason why the commission of inquiry proposed that the Act be amended so that a &#x2018;tariff of fees&#x201D; instead of a &#x201C;minimum tariff of fees&#x201D; as is at present laid down in the Act should be prescribed is that a legal opinion submitted to the commission at that stage indicated that the client was contractually obliged to pay the full prescribed minimum fees for professional services rendered even though the quantity surveyor had not rendered the full service. However, subsequent legal opinions confirmed beyond all doubt that the client could in fact enter into an agreement with the quantity surveyor to reduce the remuneration proportionally in accordance with the service rendered by the quantity surveyor.</p>
<p>The view is held that compensation calculated in accordance with the &#x201C;minimum tariff of fees&#x201D; will promote competition among quantity surveyors on the basis of expert knowledge and quality of service, and that this will be in the interests of the client in particular and of the profession in general, but that remuneration calculated in accordance with a &#x201C;tariff of fees&#x201D; would give rise to unhealthy rivalry among quantity surveyors with regard to the tariff at which the com pensation for professional services was calculated, which would necessarily lead to a deterioration in the standard of service. In the light of the aforegoing and in accordance with tee most recent legal opinions referred to and the strong objections to the recommendation of the commission received from the S.A. Council for Quantity Surveyors, the Cabinet decided to retain the existing principle of a &#x201C;minimum tariff of fees&#x201D; as provided by the Quantity Surveyors Act, 1970 (Act No. 36 of 1970).</p>
<p>Mr. President, the most important amendments of principle embodied in the Quantity Surveyors&#x2019; Amendment Bill include tee following&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(i) To provide that companies or other corporate bodies, just like natural persons, will be liable to punishment under the Act if they perform work for remuneration reserved for quantity surveyors in terms of section 7(3)(c) without having obtained exemption from the provisions of the Act. The primary purpose of the Act is to regulate the quantity surveying profession in the interests of the public. At present the provisions of the Act only apply to natural persons and, according to legal opinion, the provisions do not apply to companies or other corporate bodies. Companies and other corporate bodies performing for remuneration work reserved for Quantity surveyors can therefore infringe the Act without risking prosecution by&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(a) permitting natural persons in their service to perform quantity surveying work for which those persons are not qualified;</li>
<li>(b) performing work at a lower tariff than the minimum tariff of fees prescribed for quantity surveyors and, by so doing, supplanting the latter;</li>
<li>(c) in conflict with the professional code of conduct, canvassing for work or performing any other action in conflict with the code of conduct as laid down; and</li>
<li>(d) practising as limited liability companies, thereby placing their clients in a poor negotiating position if the company neglects to meet its obligations.</li>
</ol></li></ol>
<p>It is therefore envisaged to close these loopholes in the Act by&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) extending the definition of &#x201C;person&#x201D; to include corporate bodies; and</li>
<li>(b) amending the Act so that corporate bodies unable to register as quantity surveyors in terms of the Act for practical reasons may be exempted, subject to compliance with certain conditions from the provisions of the Act</li>
</ol>
<p>(ii) The insertion of the proposed section 31A is aimed at extending the exemption in terms of the Act to apply to corporate bodies as well. However, since the companies cannot comply with all the requirements such as academic qualifications, etc., a company may, if it complies with the conditions to be published in the <i>Gazette</i> in terms of subsection (2) of section 31 A, apply to be exempted from the provisions of the Act in order to practice legitimately as a quantity surveyor.</p>
<p>In order to afford companies and other corporate bodies sufficient opportunity to comply with the provisions or the Act, the provisions in question will be put into effect from a date to be announced by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>
<p>(iii) To provide for the establishment of boards of control to give a say on the council to persons performing professional work closely related or allied to the work reserved for quantity surveyors and for which an academic training is required. This provision will also be an enabling one in the sense that the members or any profession who want to establish a board of control must put their own house in order by organizing their members into an institute or association before being able to establish a board of control. A board of control will be autonomous as regards the arrangement of matters affecting its members. To ensure mutual co-operation between the S.A. Council for Quantity Surveyors and a board of control concerning matters of common interest, provision is made for reciprocal representation on the bodies in question.</p>
<p>(iv) In order to place the quantity surveying profession on a sound basis from the outset in States which, before independence, formed part of the Republic a new section 31C is being inserted in the Act with the aim of applying the Act to such State as well if such a State should require it.</p>
<p>That, then, Mr. President, covers all the most important changes of principle in the amending Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. President, like the two previous measures with which we have dealt, this is also an important one in that it governs the third of the three professions, i.e. that of the quantity surveyor. In the building of any large structure it is necessary to have a good team of professional engineers, the architect and the quantity surveyor. If the work of the quantity surveyor is not done well, the client can, in fact, lose a lot of money. The legislation before us improves the existing set-up. The Bill has been before a select committee and a commission; it has been thoroughly gone into and I see no reason to deal with it in greater detail. On behalf of the official Opposition I will support the legislation.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. Senator Bozas and I wish to say that many of the observations I have made in respect of the other two professions naturally also apply to the Bill before the House at the moment dealing with the quantity surveyor.</p>
<p>It will probably not be permissible for me to make reference to an actual speech in the Other Place so I shall say that on a particular occasion comment was made that the quantity surveyor is required to be extremely accurate and precise in his quantities, as failure to do so may place the safety and stability of the structure in jeopardy. This, of course, is not so, Sir. The structural stability of a building or other structure is the responsibility of the structural engineer, provided, of course, that the contractor undertakes the building in accordance with the specifications and design details. The importance of the work of the quantity surveyor lies therein, as rightly set out by the hon. Senator Bozas, that a sound system of contract documentation and accurate quantity schedules places competitive tendering on a sound basis and at the same time permits financial planning within limiting parameters and safeguards the financial entrepreneur.</p>
<p>The one fact that I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister who has referred to the minimum schedule of fees applicable to the quantity surveyor is this: Historically the engineer has undertaken and still does undertake his own quantity surveying. He employs different methods of measurement. The use of the quantity surveyor in the past by engineers has been made difficult by virtue of the necessity to accommodate a statutory schedule of fees for the quantity surveyor within the statutory schedule of fees applicable to the consulting engineer. In recent times the Chapter of quantity surveyors has made a variation to its schedule of fees and has sought to accommodate civil engineering measurements on a different scale. But even so the scale is not acceptable and still cannot be accommodated within the schedule of the fees applicable to the consulting engineer on civil engineering works. This is an aspect that still needs to be gone into further. However, it is my belief that the field of operation of the quantity surveyor will be extended continuously until it fulfils the full needs of the civil engineer as well and particularly that or the structural engineer who may be in charge as the main consultant to the client.</p>
<p>With these few remarks, we on this side of the House would like to lend our support to the Bill now before the House.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The aim of the Bill is to amend various statutory provisions applicable to the Railways. Since the implications of the various amendments are outlined in the explanatory memorandum which has already been tabled, I shall merely refer briefly to the more important aspects.</p>
<p>The Bill provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the amendment of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidation) Act (Act No. 70 of 1957), to enable the Administration to exercise its powers to recover from parties and deceased estates liable costs incurred in the recovery of, for instance, vehicles and bodies from harbour waters.</p>
<p>As in the case of the White, Coloured and Indian staff, it is the intention also to introduce a house-ownership scheme for the Administration&#x2019;s Black workers. The Bill provides for the establishment of such a scheme.</p>
<p>Provision is made, furthermore, for the acceptance of total liability by the Administration for damage caused by burning objects emanating from trains or by servants in the course of their duties, whereas the responsibility for making and maintaining fire-breaks on private property is placed exclusively on the owner or occupier of land adjoining or in the vicinity of railway lines.</p>
<p>Other amendments relate to the disposal of profit or loss arising from the sales or reallocation of dwelling houses repossessed by the Department, the extension of the option to contribute to the New Railways and Harbours Superannuation Fund in respect of periods of previous non-contributory service and the vesting of land and real rights in land acquired or used by Iscor in connection with the Sishen-Saldanha railway line and harbour, in the Republic of South Africa in its Railways and Harbours Administration.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#moll">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. C. MOLL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister has explained briefly to us what this Bill is all about, while the explanatory memorandum clarifies other aspects of it. We on this side will support this legislation but there are one or two aspects with which we are not completely satisfied.</p>
<p>We welcome the provision that in future, it will be possible for Black servants of the Railways to obtain housing loans through the Administration. In previous annual reports of the department there has often been mention of a home-ownership fund for White, Coloured and Indian staff but nothing has been said about a similar fund for Black employees. There has only been mention of housing for Black people and the amount expended in this respect. For this reason we are very pleased that such a fund is to be established for Black employees. There will then also be a home-ownership scheme for Black people. There are approximately 114 000 White Railway servants and approximately 140 000 non-White servants. Provision must therefore also be made for non-White servants and that is why we welcome this provision.</p>
<p>In this regard I want to refer to the definition of &#x201C;servant&#x201D;. The Control and Management Act defines &#x201C;servant&#x201D; as somebody who is employed exclusively in the service of the Administration. There is no mention of whether the servant is Black or White. But in this Bill there is reference to Black servants, while no definition of &#x201C;Black servant&#x201D; appears anywhere in the Act. I should like to know if a reference to a &#x201C;servant&#x201D; does not also include a Black servant, because according to clause 2 it seems as if paragraph (22) of section 2 of the Control and Management Act refers only to Black servants and that the other provisions of the Bill do not apply to Black servants. I should like an explanation from the hon. the Minister in this connection.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposed new section 69 of the same Act relating to fire-breaks, this side of the Senate is definitely not satisfied with this. At this stage we shall not vote against this provision but we feel that it is unjust of the Administration to require farmers to make these fire-breaks. A fire-break which must be at least 8 metres wide from the railway line in a sugar plantation or a forest plantation is a big piece of land. It will mean that the farmer will be heavily out of pocket because he will have to clear his land or else he will receive no compensation from the Administration as a result of fire damage caused by the Administration should he fail to do so. He will only be compensated if he has complied with this provision relating to fire-breaks. I would rather have seen the onus on the Administration because, after all, it is the Administration which is responsible for fires which occur alongside railway lines. I do not say that in every case this is the result of negligence, but the fact remains that such fires are usually caused by the Administration. For this reason I think that the onus which is now placed on the farmer is unfair. I think too that there could be a lot of argument on the definition of &#x201C;inflammable material&#x201D;. What in fact is inflammable material? As I read it&#x2014;and I think this will be the requirement&#x2014;it means that that piece of land must be completely cleared; there must be no grass or anything else growing on it. This can lead to soil erosion and have other consequences and for this reason I really think that these provisions are not fair to the farmer. They will be particularly unfair to the sugar farmer and the timber grower and people carrying on that sort of farming. Fifty metres wide is very wide, especially when one bears in mind the distance for which some farms run alongside railway lines. Fifty metres on either side of the railway line could cancel out a large part of the farming operations on that particular farm and therefore I want to ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider this clause to see if the farmers cannot be assisted.</p>
<p>Apart from that I think the legislation has been clearly framed and it will facilitate matters for the S.A. Railways as well as for the private sector. They can see precisely what is required. We shall support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#o'connell">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we thank the hon. Senator Moll who has expressed a certain amount of support for the Bill before the House. I have made notes of some of his remarks and I should like to deal with them.</p>
<p>I want to say firstly that in my view, the Bill before us contains various interesting and important amendments and, at the outset, I should like to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister on behalf of this side of the House for the explanatory memorandum which sets out the background and motivation for the proposed amendments. This annual omnibus Bill of the Railways&#x2014;as we have come to know this measure&#x2014;which covers widely divergent aspects and factors of the Administration and relates to various ordinary railways and harbours Acts, would be difficult to deal with were it not accompanied by a comprehensive memorandum explaining its advantages. I think I speak on behalf of the whole House when I confirm what the hon. Senator Moll has said and express the hope that this procedure will be followed in the future as it has been in the past.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister will realize, however, that the more information supplied in this way, the more discussion it will engender. I do not intend this afternoon to go into all the details of the Bill, but I do think that certain clauses contain particularly important principles. With your leave, I should like to refer to some of these clauses.</p>
<p>With reference to clause 1 I find it interesting&#x2014;I did not know this before&#x2014;to note that where the Administration is authorized in terms of section 2(26) of the Control and Management Act to recover certain costs which the Administration incurs in the removal of wrecks etc., this does not apply in the case of a motor vehicle found in harbour waters and which has to be removed by the Administration.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment to the Act to provide for this and similar matters is clearly very necessary, and it is fitting and timeous that it should be included in this Bill. I think, Sir, if I might put it this way, that the provision for expenditure to be recovered from an estate will not deter people from committing suicide in this way should they find that this is the most suitable and convenient method. But we leave it at that.</p>
<p>The provision made in clause 2, viz. to introduce a home-ownership scheme for Black servants as is the case with White, Coloured and Indian staff, is, in my view, particularly timeous and has the support of this side of the Senate.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Moll referred to the word &#x201C;servant&#x201D;. I have also looked at this and noted that the word &#x201C;servant&#x201D; appears in various places. If the hon. Senator would look at the clause again, he would see that it is amended by the addition of the words &#x201C;to enter into agreements for the loan of moneys to &#x2026;&#x201D;. That section is underlined. In the same paragraph the following words appear on page 6: &#x201C; &#x2026; its right to recover the amount of such premium from the servant&#x201D;. The word &#x201C;servant&#x201D; therefore appears in the existing Act. The word &#x201C;servant&#x201D; appears again in the final insertion, viz.: &#x201C;Provided further that no servant shall have the right to assign &#x2026; his interests in any property obtained on his behalf in terms of this paragraph &#x2026;&#x201D; There is no reference there to a Black servant. I think the hon. Senator is wrong. I think the English translation &#x201C;servant&#x201D; is a general word which refers to officials of the Railways. I think the word &#x201C;servant&#x201D; is used in that context.</p>
<p>The provision now being made is, in my view, consistent with the new system of leasehold rights which Black communities may now enjoy in a township under the aegis of an administration board. It is also possible for the Railway servant now to obtain loans in terms of the home-ownership scheme and the pension fund scheme. The prohibition on the ceding, pledging or hypothecating by mortgage as well as the execution of any form of judgment is regarded as desirable under the circumstances for the protection of both the home owner and the relevant fund which has advanced moneys for the purpose.</p>
<p>Another clause which I have read with great interest, Sir, is clause 8 which deals with fire control. This is a matter to which the hon. Senator Moll referred. This deals with a historically contentious situation between the owners or occupiers of land and the Administration regarding fires started by trains along the railway lines. This is a very contentious matters and has been going on for many years. I believe, and this is apparent from the explanatory memorandum, that because of complaints and representations, particularly from the agricultural sector, the hon. the Minister has effected the amendments to the existing Act to have a proper rationalization and to formulate a clear policy in respect of the matter.</p>
<p>It seems that the Bill implies a contractual agreement, and I want to dwell on this idea for a moment. I say that it implies a contractual agreement which provides that the Administration on the one hand will assume absolute liability for damage caused by burning objects from trains, or through servants in the execution of their duties, regardless of whether there was negligence or not. On the other hand, the property owner or occupier is liable for the provision and maintenance of fire-breaks with the proviso that where the property owner or occupier fails to comply with the requirements for firebreaks as contained in the Bill, he will be entitled to only 50% of his proven financial loss. In this matter the proving of negligence on the part of a servant of the Administration is no longer relevant but any litigation in future will rest on three legs. Firstly, there is the extent of the damage as such; secondly, it must be proved by the owner or occupier that the burning object which caused the fire came from a locomotive or train driven by a servant of the Administration; thirdly, it must be shown that the fire-break, if it exists complies with the requirements of subsection (3). There are then three legs on which any litigation must rest, viz. the extent of the damage, the proof by the owner that the Railways caused the fire and the provision that the fire-break shall comply with the specifications or requirements contained in the Bill.</p>
<p>†You see, Sir, so far the entire exercise appears to be completely rational and accommodating as an agreement between parties. The hon. Senator Moll has suggested that the clause and the provisions contained herein are unreasonable as far as the farmer is concerned.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Wait a second; there must be provisions in respect of any matter. I do suggest that when we examine the specification for the fire-break, certain problems naturally do arise. I say this in my capacity as an engineer. In my opinion the most important problem which arises is one which has been referred to by the hon. Senator Moll, namely the wording &#x201C;completely devoid of any inflammable material&#x201D;. He suggested there is a problem in respect of the word &#x201C;inflammable&#x201D;, but I do not agree that the problem lies there. There is, however, a problem in respect of the wording &#x201C;completely devoid of&#x2019;. There are certain aspects relative to this wording which may give one cause to wonder about its interpretation in a court of law. The first is that this is like any other contract. This is a contract between parties, a factual contract that the farmer will undertake physically to prepare a fire-break. If he prepares it in some or other manner, the Department will accept full liability for the consequences of any fire caused by the presence of the railway. In a contract of this nature the degree of tolerance in the first instance, and the method of measurement or determination of the condition, or the finish or the degree of compliance with the specifications as set out in the wording of the Bill before us are pertinent. I am saying this in a most reasonable sense, as this most interesting point was raised by the hon. Senator Moll. Let me put it to you this way, Sir, that in every contract engineers enter into the reasonability of the contract is taken into consideration. And when it can be proved in court that a contract is not reasonable, it cannot be implemented. In every engineering contract the wording &#x201C;the degree of tolerance&#x201D; is inserted. For example, if in regard to a road the contract stipulates that the road shall be level in certain sections, we would add &#x201C;to a degree of tolerance&#x201D;, and we would measure this degree with a three metre straight edge and then stipulate that the deviation therefrom could not exceed 6 mm. This is only by way of explanation, Sir. In every contract of that nature there is the question of the degree of tolerance.</p>
<p>The second aspect that comes to mind&#x2014; and this too I regard as important&#x2014;is the relevance or otherwise of a variation from the specification in a situation geometrically displaced from the point of origin of a fire; or, alternatively, the existence of some topographical constraint which eliminates the need for a fire-break. May I put it to you this way, Sir? This simply means that although a fire-break may over its entire length not comply with the requirements, the question is whether that fact was material to the further spread of the fire, or to the fire extending across the fire-break or not. It may be a situation where one has, as a topographical constraint, a deep cutting; in other words, the line might be in a deep cutting or rock cutting, where a fire-break would hardly be required. Or it may be a case where there are sand dunes, or something similar, a situation, in fact, where one would topographically not be required to provide a fire-break.</p>

<speech by="#o'connell">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Why does the hon. Senator not make his speech in due course and in that way make some contribution to the debate? The rest of us regard the matter of the protection of the farmer very seriously. If the hon. Senator regards it as a matter of hilarity that is between himself and the farmers.</p>
<p>To maintain a fire-break completely devoid of any inflammable material would be physi cally very difficult and could possibly be attained only in the strict sense of the words by means of a concrete surface or similar type of fire barrier.</p>
<p>We then come back to the question of how a court of law will interpret this. Patently the purpose of the Bill is an attempt by the department to create an accommodating situation. It has gone to some lengths to find a rational solution whereby the Railways will accept their liability but where, on the other hand, the property owner must be responsible by virtue of the presence of the railway line on his property. We say therefore that one must read into this clause a physical condition relative to the fire-break as being one that will not ordinarily convey a fire. In other words, the intention of this clause is not to describe&#x2014;this is my view and perhaps the hon. the Minister could assist us in this regard&#x2014;a state in which scientists can measure bits of straw and whatever else may be in a fire-break so as to give absolute definition to its being completely devoid of inflammable material, but rather a condition in which the fire-break shall not ordinarily assist the passage of a fire across it. The use of the word &#x201C;ordinarily&#x201D; will probably lend itself to a great deal of interesting discussion on the part of our legal colleagues here. But even then, Sir, the question of reasonability and of an orderly situation is taken into account under these particular conditions. But the emphasis, the word we seek, is to &#x201C;convey&#x201D; a fire. However, I will leave the matter at that.</p>
<p>There are a number of other interesting matters which crop up in the Bill, but these have been dealt with quite extensively in the explanatory memorandum for which we are very grateful. I think we need say no more about them, except to commend the hon. the Minister in respect of one particular aspect, viz. the rationalizing of the means of dealing with the capital budget and the integral form of budgeting which will flow from the provisions of this Bill. With these few words we on this side of the House lend our support to the measure.</p>

<p>Mr. President, we of red meat farming fame have a different name for this filibustery. We say that a gentleman is equipped with an &#x201C;oxophone&#x201D;. An &#x201C;oxophone&#x201D; is a thing which broadcasts something which I cannot tell this House. Before the hon. the Minister gets too upset, I want to tell him I will vote against this Bill. There are several good provisions in the Bill, but to tell us that the farmer now has to take the responsibility for ensuring that there is no inflammable material on both sides of the railway line&#x2014;the hon. the Minister did not even say whether it was only on one side of the railway line&#x2014;which means an area of 100 metres along the railway line, is quite unacceptable. Railways and roads have taken up a tremendous amount of valuable farming property in this country. If we continue in this way many people will eventually have to look starvation in the eye.</p>
<p>*I believe it is the duty of the Railways to accept this responsibility. Because the provisions of the proposed new section 69 discriminate specifically against the farmer, I shall oppose this legislation.</p>

<p>They know that I always have the interests of the farmer in South Africa at heart. I think it is irresponsible of the hon. the Minister, perhaps on the advice of an engineer of the Railways, to introduce legislation of this nature into this hon. House. The hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat said that organized agriculture had been consulted on this matter. I want to know from the hon. the Minister if the liaison committee actually agreed to this and if they have a copy of this piece of legislation. I would very much welcome a definite reply from the hon. the Minister in this regard.</p>
<p>I have no objection in regard to the matter of housing for Black servants. I think this is an enlightened step. I do not intend talking for long on this legislation because it is clear what the position is. If farmers are now expected to give up a valuable stretch of agricultural land 100 metres wide alongside our railway lines, I am not in favour of it. I shall oppose the legislation.</p>

<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, like my colleague, the hon. Senator Moll, I fully support the provision whereby the Administration will now be able to provide money to enable their Black servants to acquire housing. Like him again, I am very disturbed about the provision dealing with fire-breaks. I think that the new proposed section 69 may&#x2014;and I stress the word &#x201C;may&#x201D;&#x2014;be an improvement on the existing situation, but I am not too sure about that. Be that as it may, I wish to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not correct that all steam locomotives are equipped with a spark arrester. If they are not, why is that so? If they are equipped with spark arresters and these are properly serviced, is it not so that the danger of fire is absolutely minimal? If that is so, the Administration should accept full, unfettered and unrestricted liability in the case of a fire which is proved to have been started by a locomotive or a train. The conditions for the making of fire-breaks are defined in the Bill, whereas in the present Act they are not defined. There is no real definition as to exactly what is meant. The proposed new section 69 provides that the 8 metre fire-break must be not less than 45 metres but not more than 60 metres from the centre line of the railway line. What can be grown or produced or how can the land between the centre line of the railway line and the 45 metres be utilized?</p>
<p>The other question raised by the hon. Senator Moll is what can be regarded as being inflammable. When grass is green it is not inflammable, but once it starts drying off it is inflammable. What can that piece of land therefore be used for?</p>
<p>It may happen that I have a farm and that the Administration tells me that they are going to lay a railway line over it and are going to expropriate some of my land. This happened when the Richards Bay-Vryheid line was constructed. Some sugar plantation land was expropriated, but it was in the interest of the country and I am not going to argue about that. However, the hon. the Minister now provides that for 50 metres on either side of the railway line I must have non-inflammable material otherwise I can only get 50% of the compensation in the case of a fire. That being so, it would appear to me that farmers must now claim compensation from the Administration, capitalized over the period, in case they lose 50% of any claim for compensation through damage to their crops, when the land is expropriated. I do feel and I honestly submit that this is far too onerous and would appeal to the hon. the Minister and his department to have another look at this provision. To my mind this provision is unreasonable.</p>

<p>Mr. President, in principle I support this legislation wholeheartedly, but as a farmer I cannot associate myself completely with the new section 69 inserted by clause 8, which puts the onus on the farmer. I should like to make an earnest request to the hon. the Minister to consider the proposed new section regarding fire-breaks alongside railway lines. In this connection I think in particular of the large grassy plains of the Free State where a fire could start because of the wind. The onus in this case should not only be on the farmer. I therefore make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to give urgent attention to this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. President, in point of fact only two matters have been raised here. The one is in connection with the housing scheme to be introduced for our Black servants. The hon. Senator Moll asked why we referred to Black servants, but I want to tell him that we do this for purposes of identification. Provision has already been made for White, Coloured and Indian servants as far as housing is concerned, and that is why this legislation specifically refers to Black servants. The hon. Senator will realize therefore that in the second proviso to the proposed new paragraph (22) we use the word &#x201C;servant&#x201D; so that the provision applies to all servants. At the moment, however, there is no housing scheme for Black servants, and that is why this specific distinction is drawn. I do not think there is any problem in this connection.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of compensation in a case of fire damage. I think the right approach should be to ask ourselves what the position is today. What do the existing sections 69 and 70 provide, and what are we trying to put in their place? To begin with: The measure we have now introduced puts a much lighter onus on the claimant than was previously the case. If hon. Senators will look at the proposed subsection (1) they will see that all the claimant has to prove is that the burning object came from a train or locomotive, or that the fire was caused by something coming from a train or locomotive. When he has proved that, then he has discharged his onus. Up to now it was necessary for him to prove negligence on the part of the Administration, which of course is a tremendously difficult onus. We felt that in respect of the onus as well we should make these provisions much simpler than was previously the case. We now say that he must prove that the fire came from the train, and then the clause goes on to say expressly&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; the claimant shall not be required to prove that the fire was due to negligence on the part of the Administration or its servants &#x2026;</block>
<p>This is an important concession we make here to the claimant. That cannot be denied.</p>

<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>That may well be but, after all, life is made up of give and take. We did negotiate in connection with this matter. Let me say at this stage that obviously I did not conduct all these negotiations personally but I have been assured that organized agriculture was continually kept informed and that negotiations were conducted with the S.A. Agricultural Union regarding the framing of these amendments to the provisions. I am further informed that the S.A. Agricultural Union consented to this.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>I can state categorically that you said so &#x2026;</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I said it in the Other Place as well. The assurance was given to me by the Management of the S.A. Railways; I said so in the Other Place and I have not heard any objection to the aforementioned amendment apart from what I have heard here today.</p>
<p>We must go on then to examine the provisions further. We have a new provision here to the effect that the Administration will assume full liability if it is proved that the fire was caused by the train. That is all that has to be done. Then it assumes complete liability. Then it need not be shown that there was negligence. Only one of the two provisions will apply. The claimant will be fully reimbursed for his damage, as stated here, common law damage; in other words, the damage he proves. He will either be fully compensated for that damage in the case where the fire-break has been properly made in accordance with these provisions, or he will be paid out 50% of his damage. If the farmer does not take the trouble or does not want to fulfil his responsibilities regarding the fire-break, he will still be paid out but he will only be paid out 50% of his damage. This is an instance where an effort is being made to place the responsibility on both the Administration and the land owner. On the Administration&#x2019;s part efforts will of course always be made in the future to avoid fires as far as possible by ensuring that the spark arrester, to which the hon. Senator Bozas referred is functioning effectively where there is any possibility of fire. In other words, the Administration will still have to take precautions against fire because supposing the owner had failed totally to make fire-breaks? That would mean that in the event of fire the Administration would always have to pay 50% of the damage. The risk of having to pay for damage is therefore always present for the Administration, even if the owner of the land is totally irresponsible and does nothing about fire-breaks. One can of course expect that there will be a great responsibility on the Administration to see that fires are not started.</p>
<p>But on the other hand there is a responsibility on the property owner to see that damage is kept to a minimum. That is really what it amounts to, viz. that he must limit his damage to a minimum. That is why provision is made in this clause that if he does not make the fire-break, he will only receive 50% of the compensation.</p>
<p>Sir, if you look at this provision you will see that it is not an innovation. In spite of all the disadvantages which the owner previously faced regarding the onus and other matters, there was a responsibility on the owner to make a fire-break. But the old provisions laid down that an agreement had to be entered into between the Administration and the owner regarding the making of a fire-break. Then provision was also made for a very modest amount to be paid out, one to the other, depending who had to make the fire-break in terms of the agreement. All these involved procedures are being eliminated by this new provision. I want to stress that making the fire-break was always previously partially the responsibility of the property owner, while now we are placing the full responsibility for making the fire-break on the shoulders of the property owner. To counter this the Administration is assuming a very much greater responsibility than it accepted previously.</p>
<p>In subsection (3) provision is made for the width of the fire-breaks etc., and hon. Senators will see that subsection (3)(a) refers to property which is not land on which agricultural crops of any sort, including trees, are planted or sown. In that case the fire-break provisions are such that the fire-break can be smaller; in other words, the portion which must be free of any inflammable material. In cases where there are no trees or crops or such things, which in the nature of things are a greater risk, the fire-break can be smaller. But where the risk is great, because there are tree plantations, crops etc., which entailed capital investment, it is necessary that there should be provision for a wider firebreak to be made, and these are the provisions contained in subsection (3)(b).</p>
<p>Objection has been raised to the provision which states that it must be free of any inflammable material. Now I should like to ask this of the hon. Senators: If I say there should be no inflammable material in that stretch, in other words, grass which can be ignited or anything else inflammable, how can I express it better than to say it must be free of any inflammable material? What else should I say? If hon. Senators object to the fact that a requirement is laid down that it must be free of any inflammable material then I should like to hear other words in Afrikaans or English which give a better and clearer meaning to what we want to achieve than the provision that it must be free of any inflammable material. This means of course that one comes up with trivialities. In the nature of things the courts will have to decide these matters from time to time. I do most sincerely hope that court cases will be largely eliminated by this procedure, but in so far as there will be court cases, the judges will have to decide from time to time, as is always the case, what the meaning and value of words really are.</p>
<p>Lastly, I just want to mention that in respect of the width of the fire-break, the clause specifically provides that a written agreement can be entered into between the Administration and the owner of the land at the request of the latter if he feels that the provisions are too stringent in his case. The clause reads, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Provided that the Administration may on the written request by the owner or occupier of property, in its discretion and if deemed expedient under the circumstances, amend the provisions for the making of fire-breaks as stated above in respect of such property or any part of such property, as the case may be, or substitute such provisions by provisions with different wording.</block>
<p>In other words, we do not say these measurements are the laws of the Medes and Persians; there is provision that the owner and the Administration can negotiate so that an adjustment can be made regarding the provisions which are applicable. In any case these are the guidelines to be followed as a basis for making fire-breaks.</p>
<p>All things considered, Sir, I come back to the point I put at the outset, namely that hon. Senators must ask themselves if this is an improvement to what is presently on the Statute Book? I think this legislation contains all the elements of a great improvement to existing provisions. I have the fullest confidence in recommending that we should give the new provision, which is more easily definable and establishes a simpler procedure, an opportunity to see how it works. Personally I think it contains a large number of benefits for the owner, and not, as has been alleged, only disadvantages. Give this legislation a chance. It is an effort we have made in collaboration with organized agriculture, and I personally have every confidence that it will be a great improvement on what we have had up to now.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>
<speech by="#moll">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. C. MOLL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened carefully to the explanation given by the hon. the Minister, but I am still not satisfied. The hon. the Minister says that this is an improvement, but I think it is just clearer. In the existing Act there is no definition of a fire-break. As the hon. the Minister said, the onus in the past rested partly on the Administration and partly on the farmer. We cannot accept the definition of a fire-break; we cannot accept that the fire-break should be so large. The hon. the Minister has said the Administration and the farmer can deliberate on this, but in the legislation it says it must be 50 metres wide&#x2014;50 metres on both sides of the track. That means 100 metres, and each 50 metres alongside the railway line means a hectare. Sir, a hectare of sugar cane or a hectare of timber represents a lot of money to a farmer. When the guideline of 50 metres has been laid down, I cannot see that much less than that will be permitted. Because we do not feel happy about the matter, I want to move the following amendments&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(1) On page 8, in line 6, to omit &#x201C;subject to the provisions of subsection (2) &#x201D;;</li>
<li>(2) on page 8, in line 14, to omit all the words after &#x201C;(a)&#x201D; up to and including &#x201C;(3)&#x201D; in line 16;</li>
<li>(3) on page 8, in line 17, to omit all the words after &#x201C;damages&#x201D; up to and including &#x201C;damage&#x201D; in line 68.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel this puts the onus on the Administration and that is what we want. I am sure that any practical farmer will agree that the onus should not be placed on the farmer.</p>

<speech by="#o'connell">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the essence of the argument put to the House today is that there should be no responsibility on the owner or the occupier of the land and that the entire responsibility, both for the result of a fire and the prevention of a conflagration at the point of its source if such be a railway line, should rest on the Administration. That is the argument that has been advanced. But that was not my point, Sir. There is a dual responsibility and we on this side of the House feel that that dual responsibility must be shared. The point I made was that the wording of the Bill as it stood carried certain problems with it as to its interpretation in a court of law. As the hon. the Minister said, what clearer way can there be to describe the situation that is required than the wording as it appears here? May I, through you, Sir, put it to the hon. the Minister that very often in place of a specification that describes the exact physical requirements, one has a performance specification. So while we have the wording&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; in the case of property directly adjoining a railway line, excluding property mentioned in paragraph (b), a belt of ground at least eight metres in width which was immediately before and at the time of the fire mentioned in subsection (1), &#x2026;</block>
<p>&#x2026; instead of the words &#x201C;completely devoid of any inflammable material&#x201D; which follow, the clause could continue to this effect&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; maintained in such manner as not to be capable of conveying a fire across its width &#x2026;</block>
<p>After all, Sir, that is the intention and that is how a court will interpret it. I am not suggesting that we change it at this stage but the Administration may consider this suggestion in due course. In any event, the Bill makes provision under the proviso to the proposed section 69(3) inserted by clause 8, as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Provided that the Administration may on the written request by the owner or occupier of property, in its discretion and if deemed expedient under the circumstances, amend the provisions for the making of fire-breaks as stated above in respect of such property or any part of such property, as the case may be, or substitute such provisions by provisions with different wording.</block>
<p>The whole situation is therefore flexible. The Administration can make these adjustments should it be necessary. I therefore leave this thought with the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Minister has tried to justify this clause. In spite of the fact that he had support from that hon. Senator who did not speak factually, I want to tell him that I cannot accept this clause. I wonder even whether the amendments the hon. Senator Moll has moved are acceptable, but I shall consider them.</p>
<p>In the first place the story the hon. Minister tried to sell when he said that it is now so much easier for the property owner whose land borders the railway line to put his case, is not acceptable in my opinion. The other point the hon. Minister mentioned is that the Administration, in its agreement with the property owner, can change this situation. As I know the Administration, and I do not blame them for this, I am afraid that that concession will not be made. Let us be very practical. Here in the Cape the hon. the Minister does not know a lot about grass. But in the Transvaal the Railways have already taken valuable agricultural land. They have already demarcated areas on both sides of the line. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I think he is quite wrong when he says that the property owners had to make fire-breaks previously. That is not correct, Sir.</p>

<p>Yes, I know he comes from the Transvaal, but what does he know about farming?</p>
<p>The fact is that when the Railways decide to make that fire-break between the track and the fence, then the contiguous owner is called on to do his bit in that connection. The hon. the Minister is quite wrong. As far as the practice is concerned, he can consult his officials in this matter. Now an additional area is being given to the Railways because without the assistance of the Railways the owner himself has to make that fire-break. Basically it is an absolute waste of valuable agricultural land.</p>
<p>I agree with the idea which the hon. Senator Bozas expressed here, namely that he hoped the Railways would do something to extinguish those small flames coming from the engine so that they would not cause fires.</p>
<p>The other point is as follows. I do not know why the hon. the Minister thinks it is such a great concession that the property owner no longer has to prove that there was negligence. I do not think fires were caused in the past through negligence on the part of the Railway Administration because I think they are people who are aware of the dangers attaching to this. So I do not think from a practical point of view any concession has been made. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he would do well to look at this clause again.</p>
<p>I should also like to know if this legislation in its present form was submitted to the South African Agricultural Union. I want to tell you that I doubt it, but I shall accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s word if the Administration has conducted such negotiations. I shall certainly raise the matter at the first opportunity at our agricultural congress to make sure and to find out if somebody has been guilty of double talk. I do not want to make any charge against the Railway Administration. I just want to know again from the hon. the Minister whether he can give the assurance that the legislation in its present form does have the approval of the South African Agricultural Union.</p>

<p>That may be. We now have more specific provisions regarding the break. What these provisions I have just read amount to is that if the agreement provides that the Railways should make the fire-break, then the owner of the land has to pay the Railways. In this lies the joint responsibility of the owner for the making of the fire-breaks.</p>

<p>In regard to the proposal of the hon. Senator Moll I want to say the following: In the light of changed circumstances as defined in the new clause, the owner need only prove that the fire was caused by the Administration. Negligence is not an element which figures in litigation. It is accepted absolutely, regardless of whether there was negligence or not, that the Administration has to pay. Notwithstanding all those circumstances these amendments would entail that in all cases of a fire, and where there is damage, regardless of whether the owner raised a finger to try to prevent the damage through making his own fire-breaks the Administration will have to compensate him in terms of these provisions for the damage he has suffered. [Interjections.] With due respect, Mr. Chairman, the Railways do not only belong to me; they also belong to hon. Senators. Do they have no responsibility to the Railways Administration? Are the Railways just an old cow which everybody can keep on milking?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>No, they have already milked the farmers far too much.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>These obligations have applied for years to both the Railways Administration and the property owner. The hon. Senator Moll now wants to move that notwithstanding all the concessions contained in the proposed new clause, the owner of the land need do nothing but has still to be fully compensated. I do not think it is necessary to discuss the reasonableness of these amendments any further, Sir. I really do think this is a great concession.</p>
<p>I want to read the following telex message to the hon. Senator Du Toit&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Voortspruitend uit &#x2019;n vergadering van die Suid-Afrikaanse Landbou-unie wat op 30 Januarie 1979 in Durban gehou is en wat deur amptenare van die Administrasie bygewoon is, het die Landbou-unie die Administrasie formeel in kennis gestel dat die beoogde nuwe benadering aanvaar word mits die wysiging van artikel 69 ook van toepassing gemaak word op alle brande wat deur dienare van die Administrasie in die loop van hul dienspligte op Spoorwegeiendom gestig word.</block>
<p>That is the only information I can give the hon. Senator, Sir, because I did not attend this meeting. But I have had confirmation by way of this telex report that negotiations were conducted with the S.A. Agricultural Union on a particular date and that the union specifically agreed to the provisions of the amendments before us at present.</p>
<p>In our view this is a simplification and a great improvement that has been accepted by all parties, and I ask therefore that we should give the implementation of the change an opportunity and then ascertain to what extent it is successful.</p>

<speech by="#moll">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. C. MOLL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out that in my Second Reading speech I said that any fires which broke out alongside the railway line were caused by a train, or whatever, belonging to the Administration. In no case is the fire caused by the farmer. The Administration is responsible for all fires and accordingly the onus rests on the Administration. I do not maintain that the farmers will not be co-operative. In the past they have always assisted with the making of fire-breaks when asked to do so, although they were not legally obliged to do so. I think therefore that in this case farmers could also be approached.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister said that it would now be easier to show that the fire was started because of the actions of a Railway servant or through something in possession of the Administration. That is true, but what have we got in its stead? In its place we now have a definition of a fire-break which in practice will mean that the farmer will now have an overdrawn account. That is what it will mean. The one is exchanged for the other, but it puts the farmer in a far more disadvantageous position. As I have already said, Sir, the onus must be on the Administration. In my view the farmer will always co-operate, but to put the onus on him and to ask him to give up so much land to the Administration is not being fair to the farmer.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#marais">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. J. V. MARAIS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, as you know, we also have many problems in the Free State with these veld fires which in many cases are started by the Railways. All of us who have worked with steam engines in the past know that the spark arrester may be in perfect condition but after a few hours&#x2019; work a hole is burned in it and it is possible for coals to fall through it and thereby cause a fire on a threshing floor. The same applies to fires starting alongside railway lines, and that is why these fire-breaks are so necessary. I personally feel that the Railways Administration deserves thanks for the effort now being made to take further steps to try to prevent these fires.</p>
<p>This is where a heavy burden rests on the farmer, but to a certain extent they must also act to protect their property. This does not mean that I underestimate the farmers&#x2019; problems but I cannot agree with the hon. Senator Moll when he objects seriously to expensive land having to be sacrificed by the farmer. It is obvious that the more valuable the crops on the land, the better the precautions should be that are taken. That is why it is also necessary, as suggested by the Administration, that there should be a space where these fire-breaks are made to afford protection to the valuable crops alongside the railway line. I want therefore to thank the hon. the Minister for the efforts that have been made. I do not want to infer that further improvements will not be suggested next year, but we should be grateful for this concession.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in spite of the plea of the hon.

You do it at your own risk and on your own responsibility because, of course, it is not only the Railways which sets fire to threshing floors. However, as the hon. Senator Moll has said, they give with the one hand and take away with the other.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to tell the hon. the Minister at once that I accept his assurance, according to the telex report he has just read, that consultations were held with the S.A. Agricultural Union in January in this connection. But if one reads between the lines, one also sees that they have reservations.</p>
</speech>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, but I met those reservations.</p>

<p>Well, I say there were reservations, and now I want to know if the reservations which were met were put to the S.A. Agricultural Union again. After the framing of this Bill were they asked whether this was what they wanted and whether they had any objection to it? I do want to assure the hon. the Minister at once that I am not doubting his word. I accept the telex message he read.</p>
<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister is under a misapprehension. Previously there was an agreement between the Railways Administration and the contiguous property owner that the stretch reserved for the Railways was between the line and the fence, that is the fence demarcating the reserved portion. This section was cleared and became a fire-break.</p>

<p>A fire-break.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>A fire-break Sir, these hon. Senators of Cape fame only know karoo bushes which do not even burn. That was the agreement and how it worked in practice. The farmer whose farm bordered the railway reserve contributed his share to making that fire-break. This is the custom where two parties are involved when a fire-break has to be made. The laws of our country lay this down. If I want to make a fire-break on my land, I first have to advise my neighbour. He also has to do his share, even if it is only to extinguish the fire I have made on his side of the fence so that his own grazing or whatever is not damaged. That is what the position has been in practice. The hon. the Minister, however, now wants an additional stretch of land 50 metres wide on both sides of the railway line which must serve as a fire-break. He has already expropriated valuable agricultural land although we accept that it is necessary to have a railway reserve alongside the railway line. But I should like to ask the hon. the Minister what the purpose is of the reserve alongside the railway line? Why does he want it? What is the purpose of the reserve between the line and the fence? That after all is the property of the Railways. [Interjections.]</p>

But now the hon. the Minister, apart from the piece of land which he has already expropriated with the help of the taxpayer&#x2019;s money wants another 50 metres on both sides of the line to be taken away from the farmer. That is what I am objecting to and why I shall vote against this clause.</p>

<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to hear the hon. the Minister on one aspect of this matter, which has not been debated, viz. the question of soil conservation. The proposed new section 69(3)(b), as far as I can make out, requires that a railway line which passes through agricultural property, plantations, natural forests, or whatever, must be completely clear and laid bare of all vegetation &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-transport">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>
<p>Not vegetation, inflammable material.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Has the hon. the Minister ever seen green bluegum trees burn?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, but it follows that if there is any vegetation it will become inflammable at some stage or another. The hon. the Minister will concede that all over South Africa during some stage of the year the vegetation, whether it is mealielands, sugar-cane fields, plantations or natural forests, are inflammable. This is the position as I know South Africa. It seems to me that the intention is not that there should be a denuding of the land, but that will be the result of this provision. The farmer will have to denude land in order to leave a strip of 50 metres on either side of the railway line clear of inflammable material. He will have to remove grass cover, plantations, etc., and I suggest that this can only lead to soil erosion. Soil erosion takes place when the cover of the soil has been removed. There are vast areas of South Africa where there are gradients and I suggest that one of the effects of this provision will be that an increasing amount of soil erosion will take place throughout the length and breadth of this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out that the hon. Senator Crook refers to a width of 50 metres which shall be clear of vegetation, but this is not the case. The Bill does not provide for that. The proposed section 69(3)(a) provides for a belt of ground at least 8 metres in width which is situated at least 45 metres but not more than 60 metres from the centreline of the railway line.</p>

<p>That is precisely the point I wish to make. The hon. Senator Crook has incorrectly referred to the dimensions. The eight metre strip is in question, and not the geometrical relationship of that strip to the centre-line of the railway line. I think we have stated satisfactorily that in the past it was a dual responsibility and this provision is no deviation from that practice. For these reasons we support the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-transport">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in all fairness I want to point out another aspect in this connection. Section 70 of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidation) Act, (Act No. 70 of 1957) is being repealed by this Bill. Subsection (2) of that section provides for the payment of maximum amounts. Of course, these maximum amounts will now fall away completely. Hon. Senators say we must give and take but this is one example of what we are giving. Because no maximum amount is stipulated the compensation can be any amount. Section 70(3) provides&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">No compensation shall be payable to any person under subsection (1)&#x2014;<br/>(a) if he or his servant or agent contributed in any way towards the destruction or damage in question or failed to take reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate that destruction or damage.</block>
<p>This provision also falls away now. That provision meant that not only had the owner not to have contributed in any way towards the cause of the fire or the resultant damage but that he had also to do everything in his power to prevent or mitigate that destruction or damage.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? Would the hon. the Minister not say it would be reasonable to have an agreement between the Administration and a farmer in terms of which he helps to minimize the damage?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I am coming to that point. I want to convince the hon. Senator Du Toit because I think that as a person who comes from the Western Transvaal he is a reasonable person. This provision falls away completely now and that obligation no longer rests on the owner. In the past the position was that if the Railways could prove that the owner could have minimized or limited the damage, that could be advanced as a reason why the farmer should be paid less in the form of compensation. This provision also falls away now. Section 70(3)(b) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; if the land on which the destruction or damage occurred was not fully protected against any such fire by a fire-break as defined in subsection (5).</block>
<p>If the land was not protected by a fire-break, no compensation was paid. That is how the provision reads today and it is on the strength of this provision that we maintain that over the years the owner and the Administration have been jointly liable. In terms of the amendments moved by the hon. Senator Moll the Administration is deprived of the right to hold the owner responsible in any way. The owner need not do anything now; he can leave everything as it is. If there is a fire the Administration will be responsible for everything. That is the implication of the amendments moved by the hon. Senator. I submit that a very big concession is being made here in favour of the owner. In terms of the proposed new section 69 the only responsibility that rests on the owner is to make a fire-break. If he does that in accordance with the specifications laid down and in accordance with the provisions of an agreement that he has entered into with the Administration, if he has entered into such an agreement, he can claim compensation for the total amount of the damage done. It need only be proved that the damage was caused as a result of a fire caused by a train or by someone on the train.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Moll said a moment ago that these fires have always been caused by a train. But it is not necessarily always caused by a train. The employees of the owner of the land may be having a &#x201C;braai&#x201D; or they may be making a fire to keep themselves warm and so start a veld fire.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#moll">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. C. MOLL</person>:</from>
<p>I concede that.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>That may be the case. But all the owner has to prove is that the fire was caused by the Railways.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Du Toit now wants to know about the stretch of land alongside the railway line that is fenced in. The stretch of land alongside the railway line that is fenced in is the property of the S.A. Railways. That land is expropriated and becomes the property of the Railways but it does not of necessity bear any relationship to the fire-breaks that have to be made. The proposed section 69(3)(b) provides for a fire-break from the middle of the railway line. In other words, it stretches from the centre of the railway line in bote directions in those cases where there are orchards, standing crops or something similar and where the responsibility and the risk are greater.</p>
<p>I want to conclude by saying that the danger of a fire is not equally great in all cases. A fire is possible in those cases where steam locomotives are still used. In other words, where trains use electric or diesel tractive power and travel through sugar plantations, for example, the possibility of a fire is minimal in comparison with those cases where steam locomotives are used.</p>

<p>But the fire-break still has to be made?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>The fire-break can then be suitably adapted by means of an agreement. The owner need only approach the Administration and say: &#x201C;This is a special case and it is not necessary.&#x201D; The Administration and the owner can then enter into an agreement in terms of which the provisions are adapted to suit that particular case.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, there are two weak points in the argument of the hon. the Minister. In the first instance he says it will in future be very easy for the farmer whose property adjoins the railway line to prove that the Railways caused the fire. I do not think the hon. the Minister is being realistic; I do not think that can be done so easily and consequently I do not regard this as such a big concession.</p>
<p>The second point is this: In any agreement between the adjoining owner and the Administration provision is made for a fire-break, is that not so? The fire-break has to prevent anything that may fall from the cabin on to the railway line from causing a fire on the agricultural or grazing land of the farmer. Now the hon. the Minister is asking for an additional area to be declared a fire-break. I say that is unrealistic because when there is a strong wind&#x2014;like the one we have been having here in the Cape during the past two days&#x2014;even those fire-breaks that he now proposes will not prevent a fire on an adjoining property.</p>
<p>One can argue, therefore, that the adjoining land which the Administration has expropriated is sufficient. The farmer can then be asked to add another piece and another and so it can go on. I think it is unrealistic to provide that the landowner should make additional land available for fire-breaks.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Crook has advanced a very valid argument because this has to be done annually. It is no use the hon. the Minister saying that it only has to be inflammable material. The fire-break has to be cleared annually, the vegetation will be ruined and eventually one will be faced with erosion. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to leave the matter as it stands at the moment, namely, that the railway reserve or whatever it is called, that has been expropriated by the Railways be declared a fire-break and that the farmer, as in the past, does his share to see to it that the fire does not spread to his own agricultural lands. I hope the hon. the Minister will consider these representations.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to the question raised by the hon. Senator Crook and which the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell tried to reply to, but I am afraid he looked at the wrong provision. The proposed section 69(3)(b) clearly states, <i>inter alia</i>, that where agricultural vegetation of any kind is involved the belt shall be at least 50 metres in width. This can cause a lot of problems for the farmer. The hon. the Minister has indicated, and it is in the legislation before us, that the Administration will negotiate with a particular owner to change the provisions as far as fire-breaks are concerned where it may consider this necessary.</p>
<p>I think the hon. the Minister has indicated&#x2014;and I shall be pleased if he will confirm this&#x2014;that where diesel or electric locomotives are used, the Administration will willingly enter into such agreements. I refer to the sugar belt from which I come. Now, a 50 metre break on each side, measured from the centre of the railway line, will involve a great deal of land. In some cases it will be very valuable sugar land and this will involve the owner in considerable loss.</p>
<p>As the hon. the Minister has indicated that where electric or diesel locomotives are used this clause will be modified, I should like to know to what extent it can be modified so that I can refer it to the S.A. Canegrowers&#x2019; Association. I think this is important because, where you have sugar cane, circumstances are completely different to those which apply to grazing land, for instance. There are also other valuable crops such as mealie lands, vineyards and so on. I should like the hon. the Minister to give us an indication as to what he would be prepared to accept as a suitable area where diesel or electric locomotives are used.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-transport">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. Senator Bozas has put a somewhat unreasonable question to me. I think every case should be considered on its merits and the clause makes specific provision for an agreement to be entered into according to the circumstances. I think one can take it that there will be a fair and reasonable understanding and that such an agreement can be entered into in those cases where the danger of fire is not very great. In other words, it can be arranged to make the stretch of land alongside the railway line narrower if circumstances justify it.</p>
<p>With reference to what the hon. Senator Crook has said in regard to soil erosion, I do not think that that argument takes us any further. One either requires a fire-break or one does not require a fire-break. I agree with him that if one destroyed the vegetation because of its inflammable nature the danger of soil erosion would be greater than it would be had one not destroyed that vegetation. Everyone agrees that there should be firebreaks along the railway line. One must accordingly combine the two dangers and do something, firstly, to eliminate the danger of fire and, secondly, to limit soil erosion to the minimum. I cannot take it further than that.</p>
<p>I have already read practically the whole of the old section 70 but now I want to read subsection (5) to the hon. Senator du Toit. I have not read it before and shall read it now just to show him to what extent we give on every occasion. It reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">In this section &#x201C;fire-break&#x201D; means an area or areas devoid of inflammable material &#x2026;</block>
<p>More or less the same wording as that used in this legislation&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; which is or are of such an extent and situated in such a position in relation to the land in question, that the said area or areas can reasonably be expected (a) to prevent any such burning object as aforesaid from reaching and igniting any inflammable material on the said land.</block>
<p>In other words, the old section does not provide specifically how wide the fire-break should be. It only says that there has to be a fire-break, and the fire-break has to be so wide that it can reasonably be expected to prevent a fire. In other words, the hon. Senator is not at all sure how wide the fire-break on his farm has to be. That is the position according to the existing section. He makes a fire-break, appears in court and the court tells him that it cannot be reasonably expected that the fire-break was wide enough. There was that uncertainty as far as the old clause was concerned and that is why we are stating it more specifically, not only as far as the Administration is concerned but as far as the landowner is concerned as well.</p>

<p>Let me just repeat the words of the hon. Senator. He says &#x201C;If I entered into an agreement with the Railway Administration&#x201D;. But it is not compulsory to enter into an agreement with the Administration, Sir. The section says an agreement may be entered into. Even if an agreement has not been entered into a firebreak has still to be made and then that firebreak has to be in accordance with subsection (5), namely that it can reasonably be expected to prevent a fire. We are now eliminating that uncertainty, and we regard that as a concession on our part. We provide now that it can be further agreed with the Administration &#x2026;</p>

If there is an agreement and I decide to protect another part of my farm as well, must the Railways not contribute their share towards the making of that fire-break as well? Surely it is a legal agreement if we have an agreement that the Railways will make a fire-break along the boundary of my farm?</p>

<p>The reply is that in that case there has to be an agreement and according to the existing section an agreement is not compulsory. An agreement may be entered into. The Act has all along made a fire-break compulsory. The only thing I want to point out to the hon. Senator is that there still has to be a fire-break and we only want to have greater clarity than in the past.</p>

<heading>CARRIAGE BY AIR AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-transport">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Mr. President, the object of the Carriage by Air Act which came into operation on 22 March 1955 was to give effect to the provisions of the Warsaw Convention of 12 October 1929. The then Union of South Africa was a signatory to this convention which has as its object the achievement of uniformity in the field of international carriage by air.</p>
<p>Uniformity with regard to international carriage by air relates, <i>inter alia</i>, to the uniform determination of the amount of damages or compensation for which an air carrier is liable as the result of the carrying out of his carriage agreement. In this connection article 22 of the Convention lays down certain maximum amounts. The amounts in respect of which an air carrier as such may be held liable are expressed in gold francs, as was then the practice during the dispensation of the gold standard. The amounts may be converted at the prevailing rate of exchange into the national currency of the member state in which the court order in question was given. The provision in question is embodied almost verbatim in section 3(7) of the Act. In fact, the provisions of the Convention in its entirety were appended to the Act as a schedule.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, this matter of the conversion of gold francs into our national currency which is at present creating problems and has to be rectified urgently. In particular the problem was caused as a result of the revaluation of our gold reserves on 11 April last year in terms of which, to mention an example, an award of damages in a South African court may at present amount to R67,27 per kilogram in the case of luggage or freight as compared to R14,10 prior to the revaluation of the gold reserves.</p>
<p>If the extent of the share of the Republic, and especially that of the S.A. Airways, in international carriage by air is taken into consideration, the urgency of the matter becomes clear. On the other hand the Republic also has specific responsibilities in bringing about uniformity as far as this matter is concerned in relation to other member states of the Convention that find themselves in a similar situation to that of the Republic and that have already rectified the matter by way of legislation.</p>
<p>There are various methods that can be used to solve the problem, <i>inter alia</i>, by making use of the Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund. I do not wish to weary hon. Senators with these details. What I do want to emphasize is that we are moving here on a plane on which the Department of Finance and specifically the Reserve Bank are particularly active and it is for that reason that provision is being made for the conversion formula to be determined in consultation with the Minister of Finance. As adjustments may be required from time to time in practice this matter will be controlled by way of Government Notice.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I want to say immediately that we on this side of the House, the official Opposition, support this Bill. This legislation will facilitate matters greatly for the department and we support it as far as uniformity in transport by air and compensation are concerned. It was interesting to hear the hon. the Minister sketch the background and to learn that it is based on the gold franc. We on this side of the House support this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#poorter">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House would also like to support the Bill before us. It is quite interesting that the aviation history of South Africa from a Parliamentary point of view started in 1923 and in 1929 the Warsaw Pact took place. However, it did not in fact affect South Africa until 1930 because it was only then that we in South Africa for the first time flew across the borders of South Africa and actually became involved in the international affairs of aviation. Due to the fact that there was a war on, South Africa was not able to ratify this particular Warsaw Pact until 1946 and at that time these values for the franc were established. I think therefore that it is only right that now, some 33 years later, it is necessary to bring about amendments which have been explained by the hon. the Minister. The original weight of gold which was attached to the franc was something in the region of 65&#x00BD; milligrams of gold. That was the value of the French franc at that time. It stands to reason therefore that as it was attached to a certain weight in gold there should be an amendment brought about which has been implemented by the Bill before the House today.</p>
<p>When reading through the 1946 Hansards one almost finds oneself in the situation where one wonders whether one is speaking of the Senate of today or the Senate of 1946. I found it rather strange and rather interesting to find the names, De Villiers, Van Zijl, Steenkamp, Henderson, Du Toit, Van Rensburg and Vermeulen among the hon. Senators who served at that time. Many of those who are serving today are perhaps relatives of former Senators. Nevertheless it was interesting to read through the debates of 1946 when the 1929 Warsaw Pact was in fact ratified here in Parliament I found it a most interesting exercise. We on this side of the House have great pleasure in supporting the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The amendments to the principal Act have been requested by the Public Accountants&#x2019;s and Auditors&#x2019; Board, and, apart from the amendment to section <i>26bis</i> of the principal Act, make provision for matters concerning accountants and auditors resident and registered in neighbouring states.</p>
<p>In the first place the amendments will enable the board to enter into an agreement with a body of accountants and auditors in any of the Republic&#x2019;s neighbouring states to provide assistance with matters affecting the registration and discipline of registered accountants and auditors and with the registration, education and training of articled clerks and such other assistance as may be required until such states establish their own accountants&#x2019; boards or other controlling bodies.</p>
<p>Secondly, the provisions of the Bill will enable accountants and auditors of neighbouring states to perform work in the Republic. Such an arrangement can be considered a reciprocal act in view of the fact that it is desirable for accountants and auditors registered and resident in the Republic who performed work in neighbouring states prior to their obtaining independence, to continue to perform work in such states for at least a transitional period, especially where work is being performed for clients who have holding companies in the Republic and subsidiaries in the independent states. I have the assurance of the Board that it will extend the right only to accountants and auditors who have approved qualifications.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, in terms of the provisions of section <i>26bis</i> of the principal Act a firm of accountants and auditors with one or more branch offices must inform each client of the whole firm, i.e. each client of each branch, of a change in the name, constitution or address of the firm.</p>
<p>Firms find it onerous and expensive to comply strictly with the present provisions of the Act and therefore clause 3(b) of the Bill provides that if an accountant and auditor or his firm has a branch office and one of the changes mentioned, takes place, he will be deemed to have complied with the provisions of the Act if he or his firm informs the board and each person served by such a branch, of the change.</p>
<p>I am satisfied that the amendment is realistic and in the interests of the accounting an auditing profession and that it will not intrude upon the rights of clients.</p>

<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to support the legislation before us. It is rather important legislation from two points of view. Firstly, it ensures co-operation and collaboration with the neighbouring territories, something that I think is very important indeed. In the past the profession in the Republic has been servicing these areas and will continue to do so, and therefore I think it is only right and proper that this collaboration and co-operation should continue. The fact that it is reciprocal is, of course, welcome indeed.</p>
<p>As far as the second condition is concerned, regarding the giving of notice, it is quite correct that the present provisions are rather onerous because some of these national firms have offices in small towns where perhaps they have 20, 30 or 50 clients, whereas in the country as a whole they have thousands. To have to give a notification to thousands of clients while the matter only affects 50, is asking rather too much. Therefore, Sir, I have great pleasure, on behalf of the official Opposition, in supporting this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;.</p>
<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>
<p>The Bill that is before the House contains amendments to five Acts administered by the financial institutions office, i.e. the Insurance Act, the Pension Funds Act, the Friendly Societies Act, the Banks Act and the Building Societies Act.</p>
<p>Legislation of this nature is, quite understandably, a hardy annual and deals with a wide range of issues. As in the past I shall confine my remarks to the more important ones.</p>
<p>Before coming to amendments affecting the specific Acts, I wish to refer to a reduction effected by the proposed measures in the percentages of prescribed assets and Government securities which insurers, pension funds and banks are required to hold. The reduction is 2% in respect of all such percentages and has been in force since 9 June 1978 when the reduction was originally announced.</p>
<p>When the percentages were increased during 1977, an undertaking was given that the situation would be reviewed as soon as circumstances permitted. I am grateful that this could happen so soon.</p>
<p>Regarding the Insurance Act, a very necessary tightening up of the provisions on the furnishing of guarantees is proposed. It is proposed that the Registrar of Insurance be empowered to determine whether a person is furnishing guarantees on such a scale that he is in fact carrying on the business of furnishing guarantees and therefore must register under the Act. The present test for determining whether a person is carrying on guarantee business, i.e. whether he is &#x201C;solely or mainly&#x201D; carrying on such business, is difficult to apply when a person does not solely carry on such business. Furthermore, a person may not be carrying on the business of furnishing guarantees as his main business activity and yet be furnishing guarantees on a considerable scale, a state of affairs that presently exists. Considerable contingent liabilities arise from these activities and it is in the interest of the public that persons who grant guarantees as a business should be brought under the discipline of the Insurance Act.</p>
<p>In the second place a provision is proposed to curb and prohibit undesirable practices in the insurance industry. The measure proposed has been recommended in principle by the Commission of Inquiry into the Long-Term Insurance Industry, and although the recommendation was in respect of long-term insurance only, it is equally appropriate in the case of short-term insurance. The proposed measure is therefore being applied to the insurance industry as a whole.</p>
<p>The proposed section 23B provides for powers to the Registrar to declare, with the consent of the Minister, a practice or method of conducting business as irregular or undesirable, by way of notice in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> In the case of long-term insurers and intermediaries, prior consultation with the Advisory Committee on Long-Term Insurance is required by the proposed measures before a declaration is consented to by the Minister. The Registrar is also empowered to direct a person who made use of such practices or methods to rectify any state of affairs which resulted from their employment.</p>
<p>In introducing this measure I wish to place on record that it is not being written into the Act because our insurance industry is fraught with undesirable practices. On the contrary, there is every reason to be proud of the way the industry has been and is conducting its business. Insurance is a growing industry where competition for business is keen. In isolated cases practices and methods could be used which are not in the interest of the industry or the public in general. The proposed measures provide the machinery to regulate such practices and methods timeously. Similar measures exist in one or other form in many other countries and there is also a comparable provision in our Banks Act.</p>
<p>The last insurance provision I want to refer to is that dealing with group life insurance affecting persons performing military service.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators will remember that last year legislation affecting existing life policies insuring the lives of military personnel was overhauled by a revision of section 38 and that a completely new approach was introduced in respect of new policies in the new section 38A. The intention with the legislation was to find a balance between the interests of servicemen on the one hand and the willingness of life insurers on the other hand to insure persons performing military service. When overhauling the legislation, the position of group life policies which an insurer may amend or cancel was inadvertently overlooked. Such policies are, as far as their terms and conditions are concerned, intended to be of a short-term nature and to be revisable or subject to cancellation, as the case may be, in the light of the underwriting experience with the group in question. They also never give rise to surrender values. The permanent restrictions imposed by the present provisions are irreconcilable with the idea of amendable or cancellable group life policies. It is therefore proposed, with the concurrence of the Department of Defence, to exempt group life policies which may be amended or cancelled by an insurer from the provisions of sections 38 and 38A. It should be pointed out that other group life policies will not be affected.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, as far as the amendments to the Pension Funds Act and the Friendly Societies Act are concerned, there is only one significant change affecting the firstmentioned Act, but I should like to point out that in the case of both Acts the authority to issue regulations is transferred from the State President to the Minister. The position is therefore being brought into line here with the practice which is generally followed at present. The important change to the Pension Funds Act is to make it possible for a pension fund to make a loan to a member against first mortgage on a surveyed site in a Black urban area against which a leasehold right is registered. Building societies already have the right to grant loans in Black urban areas and the proposed amendment should further enable Blacks to acquire leasehold rights in their urban areas.</p>
<p>I come now to the amendments to the Banks Act and the Building Societies Act. In addition to a reduction in the percentage ratio which a banking institution must maintain in prescribed investments, the Banks Act amendments comprise two aspects. Firstly, the classes under which banking institutions may be registered are being restricted by the deletion of the classes &#x201C;hire-purchase bank&#x201D; and &#x201C;savings bank&#x201D;. The business conducted by these two sorts of banking institutions can at the same time be done by a general bank and, as far as the financial and other requirements of the Banks Act are concerned, no distinction is drawn between the three classes mentioned. There is therefore no sense in retaining separate classes for registration purposes. The few hire-purchase and savings banks will be reclassified as general banks.</p>
<p>Secondly, the capital requirements for banking institutions have been adjusted. At present a banking institution which is not a discount house must maintain capital and unimpaired reserve funds to an amount equal to 10% of its obligations in regard to acceptances on behalf of clients, plus 6% of all its other liabilities to the public. The Technical Committee on Banking and Building Society legislation investigated this requirement and came to the conclusion that there is no reason to establish a higher requirement for liabilities in regard to acceptances than in the case of other liabilities, and accordingly the requirement in respect of acceptance liabilities has been brought into line with that in respect of other liabilities, that is, reduced to 6%. Furthermore, provision is being made for the flexible implementation of the restriction imposed on banking institutions by the Banks Act in regard to their investments in fixed property and shares where this is deemed to be desirable.</p>
<p>In terms of the Building Societies Act a building society can restore and improve buildings on fixed property that it has bought back because of neglect on the part of the debtor, and it can also instal an electricity, water or sewerage system, but where the erven it buys in are undeveloped, it may not effect improvements. At present building societies find it very difficult to sell such vacant erven, even at a loss, but would be able to dispose of them fairly easily without loss and possibly even at a profit if they were allowed to build houses on them. In order to meet building societies in this connection and to enable a building society which has a development company to erect a building on such land through its development company, the powers of both building societies and their development companies are being extended.</p>
<p>The Building Societies Act has also been amended with a view to the promotion of the improved State-aided savings scheme for prospective home-owners, so that the amount in an account under that scheme shall not be taken into account for the purposes of the statutory limit on the amount which a person may have in a savings account with a building society.</p>
<p>Mr. President, various representative bodies interested in the proposed legislation have been consulted and the legislation is acceptable to them. Amendments to the Insurance Act with regard to long-term insurance were submitted to the Advisory Committee on Long-Term Insurance, and representative organizations of insurers and brokers were also notified of amendments to the Insurance Act. The Association of Pension and Provident Funds was consulted in regard to the pension fund legislation, and in connection with banking and building society legislation the Technical Committee on Banking and Building Society Legislation was consulted, as well as the representative bodies of these institutions.</p>
<p>I ask for the support of the House for the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we shall support the Bill before us with certain reservations which we shall discuss in the Committee Stage. The hon. the Minister has stated quite correctly that this is a type of omnibus Bill, a hardy annual, affecting various financial institutions in this country. In the main, Sir, the Bill before us deals with pension funds, insurance, building societies and banks. I think the main provisions are contained in the amendments affecting these institutions. I think too that for the purposes of discussion one should disregard a large number of textual amendments to the Bill.</p>
<p>I say we support the Bill because there are some very good provisions in this Bill. Among others, we support those amendments which reduce the liquid ratios of insurance companies, building societies, banks and pension funds. We support this because we feel it is a measure which will inject extra money into our economy if this is taken up by the public. The measures will therefore help to stimulate our economy through increased consumer spending. In this respect they will help to attain the higher growth rate target and will offset the effects of recent price hikes, the most recent being the fuel price hike.</p>
<p>It is clear from the explanatory memorandum&#x2014;for which I want to express the appreciation of the Opposition&#x2014;that insurers and pension funds and building societies have enjoyed this privilege of relaxed ratios since 9 June 1978. It seems therefore that relaxation of these requirements on the part of banks was the only stimulus which came into effect during the course of this year. I think the hon. the Minister announced this just before his budget speech in Another Place.</p>
<p>There are a large number of concessions which came into effect during the course of last year, and there are other provisions which we welcome, e.g. that building societies and pension funds have been empowered to lend money to leasehold owners of property in Black urban areas. According to reports we have received, the building societies have a fair amount of money available for loans of this kind and one can only express the hope that there are a sufficient number of building stands and properties available for our Black people in urban areas to enable them to make full use of the benefit now being granted to them.</p>
<p>We do, however, also have certain reservations about this Bill. The hon. the Minister may know that we have certain proposed amendments which unfortunately we could not place on the Order Paper, and the hon. the Minister will understand why. It was not his fault; this was due to circumstances beyond anybody&#x2019;s control. In clause 9(1) the hon. the Minister has made provision to combat certain undesirable practices. Our question on this clause is why, in the proviso, certain types of insurance or insurers are excluded from the provisions of this clause. For instance, why must the Registrar only consult the advisory committee in the case of certain insurance undertakings and not in others?</p>
<p>In clause 12, exemption is given to group insurers under the new section 38B, and I must admit that in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum I could find no sufficiently good reason for the exclusion of these group insurance schemes. I see no reason for this, and I do not think any clear reason has been given as to why they should be exempted. I think the hon. the Minister will have to motivate his reasons more explicitly before we can accept this.</p>
<p>I come now to clause 30. If the hon. the Minister will look at this clause he will see that in terms of paragraph (b) a new subsection is being substituted for the existing subsection (2). The existing subsection (2) provided for a transition period in the past when increased liquid ratios were proposed. This transition period was nine months, and during that period to which the present subsection (2) refers, financial institutions were given the opportunity to put their house in order and to comply with the necessary requirements. The hon. the Minister is seeking by means of the amendment to change the percentage requirements without limiting the percentage or limiting the increase, and he may also by, say percentage X, increase the amount without staggering it in the same way as it was done in the existing subsection (2). As was the case with the last increase in 1977-&#x2019;78, we might find that this could harm businesses. The hon. the Minister knows what happens in these cases. Overdrafts are called up and those businesses which are most vulnerable are called upon to pay up first. This causes untold hardship; it causes unemployment and it also causes harm to our economy.</p>
<p>Therefore, Sir, we shall seek to insert certain ameliorating provisions by way of amendments to this Bill. I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that we are not totally against this sort of discretionary power, but I do think in all fairness that it should be limited and the hon. the Minister should, after such provisions have been introduced, bring them to Parliament, <i>ex post facto</i>, if that is the expression, for its approval. We shall bring these amendments to the notice of the hon. the Minister during the Committee Stage.</p>
<p>I believe that the risks attaching to discretionary powers of this nature are much too grave not to have limits attaching to those powers. The hon. the Minister may say that we are dealing with a responsible department and a responsible Minister, but that is all very well. One of the oldest sayings which is still true to this day is that it is human to err, especially in matters of this nature. Even after discussions with his department, I do not think the hon. the Minister can carry this burden without any sort of limitation.</p>
<p>With these few words I should like to tender our support for the Second Reading on behalf of this side of the House, and we hope that in his reply to the Second Reading debate and during the Committee Stage the hon. the Minister will be able to give satisfactory replies to our queries.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is clear from what the hon. Senator Swanepoel has just said that in principle the Opposition is in favour of this amending Bill. Any changes that are proposed often emanate from institutions that have themselves asked for them, institutions that are concerned in the matter. For the rest they are changes that with the passage of time have proved to be essential after certain legislation has been put to the test for a certain time. That is also what has happened in this case and that is why we think these changes are necessary.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel has expressed his doubts in respect of a number of the clauses and we can have a look at those, among others clause 30, when we come to the Committee Stage. I think there is an amendment on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. Senator Webber. The hon. Senator also expressed certain doubts in respect of clause 12 which provides that section 38 of the principal Act which provides for group life insurance schemes, should be excluded. I am not quite sure that the hon. Senator Swanepoel is right when he says that even after reading the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech and the explanatory memorandum he is not yet convinced that that type of insurance should be excluded. I think more than sufficient reasons have been advanced. After all, the hon. the Minister has pointed out that they are of a particular nature. Such a policy has no surrender value, its terms can be altered and it can even be cancelled; it is of a short-term nature and periodically it can be revised. Those are characteristics of that type of policy and I think the hon. the Minister is quite justified in excluding them. As a matter of fact, during his Second Reading speech the hon. the Minister pointed out that this type of policy had actually been included in error, that in point of fact it ought never to have been included. The hon. Senator must remember that last year when the Insurance Act was amended the military risk was removed from it. In other words, insurance companies could sell policies which excluded the military service risk. I believe the idea is that the Department of Defence itself will make provision for that so that those people will be properly covered.</p>

<p>Sir, I too should like to support this Bill in principle. As the hon. the Minister said during his Second Reading speech, the measure proposed was recommended in principle by the commission of inquiry. The hon. Senator Dempsey has just mentioned a point&#x2014;the hon. Senator Swanepoel also mentioned it&#x2014;in respect of which I should like some clarification. According to the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister it is proposed, with the concurrence of the Department of Defence, to exempt group life policies which may be amended or cancelled by insurance companies. I should like the hon. the Minister to elaborate on that and tell us exactly what the standpoint of the Department of Defence is in this connection.</p>
<p>*Sir, I have certain doubts about the important changes that are being effected to the Pension Funds Act. The excuse offered is that building societies already have the power to grant loans to Blacks in urban areas and that the proposed amendment will assist Blacks further to obtain leasehold rights in urban areas. It is true, Sir. Building Societies take risks; they are business organizations. Pension funds, however, are completely different and I am just worried as to whether there will be sufficient guarantees when pension funds are invested in Black urban areas under the 99-year leasehold scheme. Will it be possible to hold them liable? [Interjections.] Sir, the hon. Senator of Zulu fame need not think that I am &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D;. I am just concerned about the safety of the money in the pension funds; it may affect his pension. If all the money in the Parliamentary Pension Fund is lent out and there are insufficient guarantees, everyone of us will be affected. However, I am not unduly worried about the position, Sir, but I shall be pleased to receive some assurance from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Swanepoel has dealt with clause 9 and I await with interest the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply because I have an amendment on the Order Paper. I cannot at this stage see why the provision that the advisory committee be consulted should apply to only certain types of insurance.</p>
<p>My main objection is in respect of clause 12, namely the withdrawal of the military provisions&#x2014;I prefer to refer to them as that&#x2014;contained in sections 38 and 38A covering policies on the lives of groups of persons who are insured and under which the insurer may amend the policy conditions. I want to say right at the outset that I know the policy is issued subject to the condition that the company may alter the provisions, but I am very unhappy about this, Sir. Most of the people who take out group life cover are under the impression that they are fully covered and that the terms of the policy are not subject to alteration. In fact, Sir, over the years we have had many cases where people, particularly people in Government employ, in the employ of the Railways, the Police, and so on, have been most unhappy&#x2014;teachers as well&#x2014;about the sudden changes that have been required by the insurance or assurance company. These people find that when they retire they are required to pay three times the premium they paid whilst they were employed in order to maintain the cover. They are not in a financial position to do so because their income has been reduced. One may say that they should have known what the terms of the policy were before they entered the scheme, but in many cases these group schemes are merely accepted. The new employee is told about the group scheme but he is not fully informed about all the provisions. Most of these people are laymen; they are prepared to accept what the agent tells them and they do not go deeply into the provisions of the policy. It is only later that they find that they have been taken for what I want to refer to and describe as a king-sized ride. Rather than deleting this, the hon. the Minister should effect an amendment forbidding the changing of policy conditions. In other words, once a policy has been taken out the conditions should be fixed and final. I should like the hon. the Minister to consider that.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I neglected at the beginning to thank the hon. Opposition for their preparedness to discuss this measure at very short notice. I appreciate it as it certainly assists me with my own programme at the moment. I am very glad therefore that it has been possible for us to deal with this measure today. I want to record my appreciation in that regard.</p>
<p>I should like to thank the hon. Senator Swanepoel for supporting this measure. It is a sort of small omnibus legislation which arises really in the light of experience that one has with the administration of these various Acts affecting important financial institutions.</p>
<p>The question in respect of clause 9, undesirable practices, is really a technical matter. The Advisory Committee on insurance in fact only deals with long-term business as it stands, and if in fact it were an advisory committee on all types of insurance I should have been only too pleased to accept the hon. Senator Bozas&#x2019;s amendment&#x2014;if we had still drafted the legislation in that way under those circumstances, which I do not think we would have done. However, the difficulty is, as it stands, it will be contrary to the Act if we change it because, as I say, this Advisory Committee can only advise on long-term insurance business in terms of section 2A of the Act. This position arises from the report of the commission of inquiry on long-term insurance business. What I think should happen in the foreseeable future if insurance business continues to increase on the scale it is doing so now&#x2014;and I would welcome it&#x2014;is that the short-term interests in the business should also be in the position where they have an advisory committee. We will certainly give attention to that In fact, the recommendation of the commission was really seen in that light, i.e. that as soon as practicable we would wish to discuss the matter further with the short-term side of the industry which is very important and see whether they did not think the time was arriving where there might be a similar type of body for short-term insurance. We are finding this advisory committee on the long-term side extremely useful. I hope therefore that the hon. Senator will accept that. It is a purely technical matter in that sense, but otherwise I have no objection to his point of view.</p>
<p>*With regard to the exemption for group policies, the hon. Senator Swanepoel has the explanatory memorandum but I do not think all the members have already seen it. I should like to quote a few paragraphs from it because I think this is an important matter. It deals with the war provision, &#x201C;the war clause&#x201D;, as we usually call it. As I have it here, the explanation is as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The proposed section 38B exempts a group life policy under which the insurer has the right to amend or cancel the policy from the provisions of sections 38 and 38A of the Act. Section 38 applies to life policies effected before 21 June 1978 &#x2026;</block>
<p>This is the date of commencement of the Financial Institutions Amendment Act, 1978&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; and contains the following main provisions in respect of these policies:</block>
<ol>
<li>(a) a provision in a policy which excludes or limits liability during war service, or increases premiums in respect of it, is invalid, except if the service is rendered outside the Republic or in any aircraft and the deceased&#x2019;s dependents are entitled to a Government benefit.</li>
<li>(b) If the risk is excluded as permitted, the premiums must nevertheless be returned in the event of death.</li>
<li>(c) Cover once provided in respect of war service or any other military service may not be withdrawn.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is because it is a long-term policy&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Section 38A &#x2026;</block>
<p>This is the amendment which was effected last year&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; applies to life policies taken out from 21 June 1978 and provides in the main&#x2014;<br/>(a) No cover in respect of military service is obligatory, but premiums must be returned in the event of death on military service if no or inadequate cover is provided.</block>
<p>Therefore it is no longer compulsory&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">(b) Cover once provided in respect of military service may not be limited or excluded.<br/>(c) If an extra premium is charged in respect of military service specifically, the amount must be stated in the policy and the total premium reduced by such amount if the owner of the policy requests a withdrawal of the military cover.<br/>(d) A Policy may not be refused to a person on the grounds that he is performing or is likely to perform military service.</block>
<p>It goes on to state&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The provisions as outlined above clearly do not have amendable or cancellable group life policies in mind. These policies are basically of a short term nature and periodically revisable in the light of group experience. Furthermore these policies have no surrender values.</block>
<p>&#x201C;No surrender values&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It is therefore apparent that these policies were inadvertently brought under the provisions of sections 38 and 38A and it is now proposed to rectify the position.</block>
<p>†Mr. President, what we are saying in regard to these group policy schemes, is that in the nature of things they must be capable of adjustment otherwise they are simply not possible. In other words, there must be an element of flexibility in these schemes which are in fact not long term in the sense of the normal long-term life policy. It was in fact really an oversight on our part not to do this last year.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>No, on our part. I think one can put it as clearly as that. If we had thought about it more fully last year we would probably have tried to exclude them from section 38 at that stage.</p>
<p>The Defence Department is in agreement with our point of view that they be excluded and what it in fact means, is that the insurance company now has the discretion. Nothing prevents the insurance company in a group life policy from providing this type of cover if it so wishes. We are leaving it entirely to the insurer. In practice I suppose an insurer would tend to be rather reticent about putting this in because there are technical difficulties by virtue of the kind of policy. This is the point that they, of course, also make to us.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Du Toit quite rightly raised the point of exactly how the matter stands <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department of Defence, and I should like to say that we and in particular the Registrar for Financial Institutions have been having a number of discussions with the Department of Defence in order to provide a really satisfactory policy for servicemen or people subject to military duty and military service. He tells me that they have progressed extremely well and that he expects very shortly that in consultation with the insurance industry and the Department of Defence, they will be able to announce what looks like being a very practicable solution to this. However, the final version is not yet ready to be announced. That is the position. To a large extent it is because of the technical nature of a group policy. I hope the hon. Senator Swanepoel and also the hon. Senator Bozas who raised this point, may feel that they can accept that position. However, we are not saying in respect of a group policy or to the insurance company providing it that they may not provide this or must not provide it. We simply say: &#x201C;If you wish to, you can.&#x201D; We are not insisting, however, because we realize there are difficulties.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, we can discuss clause 30 further in the Committee Stage because there are amendments on the Order Paper in this connection. The hon. Senator Swanepoel also raised this matter and perhaps he will leave it at that for the moment.</p>
<p>I want to thank the hon. Senator Dempsy for supporting the measure.</p>
<p>I have already replied to one or two points but I think the hon. Senator Du Toit too has referred to clause 14 which deals with the 99-year leasehold scheme and the fact that pension funds will be made available in the form of loans to Blacks in urban areas. Mr. President, all that they are being allowed to do is to grant a mortgage bond on the security of property, and a mortgage bond on fixed property, is of course, always very good security. As a matter of fact, the pension funds have asked for it and we could see no reason why we should not accede to their request. We shall watch the position but I think it is a step in the right direction and perhaps the hon. Senator will agree with me. I admit that he is right when he says that a pension fund must be very careful as to what it does with its funds. As far as investments are concerned, a pension fund has to be conservative. Pension funds themselves have already acquired a great deal of experience and are, in fact, conservative. As a matter of fact, our experience has been that the managements of pension funds are very responsible and very careful in whatever they do. But I think it is very important that they have this power and I trust the hon. Senator will also see it in that light.</p>
<p>Mr. President, apart from clause 30 I think I have dealt with all the important points raised.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are changing this. As far as the existing position is concerned it is a question of whether guarantee business is, in fact, wholly or mainly being done. This is some thing which cannot very easily be interpreted and decided upon in practice, as I tried to point out in my introductory speech. The office of the registrar feels that in fact it would be more practicable if it could be left to the registrar&#x2019;s discretion to say whether any business is a guarantee business which should be registered under the Insurance Act. It is a question of what we think is a more practicable way of achieving control because, in fact, guarantee business is very important in relation to the operator of it.</p>

<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate on this Bill, I referred to the question of the so-called short-term insurer, the group life cover, and whilst I appreciate the point the hon. the Minister made in both his explanatory memorandum and his reply, I am most unhappy that insurance companies should be able to opt out of the war risk or war cover.</p>
</speech>

<p>As a group?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>As a group. We have covered the other, because if they do not cover war risk they have to tell the policy holder and if necessary they have to refund the premium. This is quite clear, and last year we supported the amendment. I think we have that absolutely clearly. But, Sir, most of these young men who join a particular service and are covered by a group life policy have over the years to undergo their national service. Generally 90% of them, perhaps 99% of them, are unaware of the condition that the policy can be changed at any time. They are unaware that the war risk can be taken out, and we may well find that whereas they think they have provided for their families, in fact they have no cover at all. I am very concerned about this, Sir. Rather than let the companies holding these group life cover policies off the hook, I feel we should say to them that if they want to increase the premium to cover war risk, so be it. But please, Sir, do not let them off the hook.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to support that point of view. As the hon. the Minister has pointed out, group insurers may provide this sort of cover, but I want to tell you, Sir, that my experience of group insurance is not a very happy one. What usually happens is that people fall for this sort of insurance for the simple reason that they are brought under the impression that cover is provided for them, because they insure as a group, at a very much cheaper rate than they would have to pay if they take out the same sort of insurance as individuals. If the insurance companies are given this sort of exemption, in what position does the man who goes on military service find himself? He finds himself in the position where he is a member of a group insurance scheme but now all of a sudden he finds that he is not covered. What are his options? What are the options open to him? He can now on his own take out an individual insurance policy. He has most probably already signed a stoporder for his group insurance and can now take out an individual insurance policy which, in any case, is loaded. How many people in business can even afford this sort of thing when they go to the border for three months or longer?</p>
<p>I am not so concerned about the young man who goes on military service for the first time, Sir, because I think the number of these young people belonging to group insurance schemes is very much smaller. Many of our young people go straight from school to do their two years&#x2019; military training. But after completion of their service and when they enter employment it is more often than not the case that they become members of these group insurance schemes.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, this is one aspect of the insurance industry that the hon. the Minister should ask the associations to go into because the group insurance scheme is certainly not a very popular one. People have many complaints about these schemes. It is &#x201C;boere-verneukery&#x201D; and nothing less in the eyes and the opinions of many people.</p>

Senator goes into the history of group insurance he will find out that in many cases when people retire they cease to be members of a group insurance scheme. In their old age they then all of a sudden find themselves without any insurance cover at all after having paid into a group insurance scheme over many years.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, there are many such examples. If such people wish to remain members of such a scheme, they have to pay a heavily loaded premium, something which one cannot afford in one&#x2019;s old age because then one has a reduced income, be it pension or interest, and cannot afford it. To exempt them from these obligations, i.e. the military risk, is to my mind not fair. The hon. the Minister will have to advance very good reasons as to why we should not vote against this clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened attentively to the hon. Senator Swanepoel and even if the whole question of group insurance schemes and group policies is perhaps not at issue at the moment, I know that the position in the past was not what it should have been and that some people who were insured under this type of policy were not quite happy. In the light of this debate I am quite prepared to have this matter thoroughly investigated once again. I shall ask the Registrar to go into the matter.</p>
<p>In this case we have something of a problem because, as I have said, these group insurance schemes are not in fact long-term insurance schemes as in the case of an ordinary life policy. Experience has taught us that these schemes have to be adjusted from time to time and that they have to be amended, something which one cannot do unilaterally in the case of an ordinary life policy. The Registrar has asked me to emphasize in particular the fact that the special insurance with which we are dealing at the moment and to which I referred a moment ago in answer to what the hon. Senator Du Toit said, is also a group insurance scheme to some extent. The difference is, however, that the Government will be the underwriter. The policy that is being offered in consultation with the Department of Defence is therefore a much better policy. We shall still have further discussions but as a result of this it will not be necessary to adjust some of the existing group insurance schemes. I think we shall have to see how they fit into things. Perhaps it will not be necessary to make drastic adjustments either. However, we are going very thoroughly into the matter.</p>

<p>Will the hon. the Minister just repeat what he said?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Certainly. I was talking about the special insurance that we were in the process of arranging in consultation with the Department of Defence. It is a kind of group insurance scheme but it is a type on its own. The difference is that the Government will underwrite it and as a result adjustments may not of necessity have to be made. It depends on the type of some of the existing group insurance schemes and the exact nature of the cover they offer. Perhaps it may not be necessary to adapt them drastically. It will depend, however, on the nature of the specific group insurance policy. As far as other group insurance schemes are concerned, the position is mainly as I have already explained. The insurers who are very anxious to be of assistance agree that it will be necessary from time to time to make adjustments in the light of changed circumstances, for example, changes in interest rates which affect their investment policy or perhaps the risk itself that they run. The position is fairly flexible, therefore, and I wonder whether the hon. Senator will not give us an opportunity first to finalize this special policy for servicemen that we are in the process of drawing up in consultation with the Department of Defence. We shall consider this aspect very thoroughly, especially in the light of this discussion. If there are further reservations I am prepared early next session to raise the matter again because it is a very important one. We can try to find an early opportunity of doing so. That is the position at the moment and it is very difficult to take it any further because the matter has already been very fully discussed with all parties concerned and it is felt that together with the Department of Defence we should go on with this amendment in the light of the development that has taken place in the existing position.</p>

<speech by="#scheepers">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak against clause 12. I think it is most unfair to induce people to go in for group insurance and then, when they retire, they arc required to pay premiums which they cannot afford. The hon. Senator Fick asked who was involved. I know that the Permanent Force contributed to one group insurance scheme run by the same company, and I think the hon. Senator Du Toit will confirm that teachers were also involved. Both of us knew teachers who were involved and who also fell for this. I know of an officer in the Permanent Force who paid premiums which were increased from time to time in small amounts which he could afford. Prior to his retirement he was paying R36 a year for this group insurance but on retirement he was notified that he could remain a member but that he had to pay R44 a month. Nobody going on pension, particularly the sort of pension this category of person receives, can pay such a high amount.</p>
<p>There are exceptions, however. In the case of the garment workers we have a small group insurance scheme which provides life cover. It covers the whole family, and the amount is very small. It has had to be increased by a few cents a week on occasion, but when a member retires or if he leaves the industry and enters another industry he can remain a continuation member by paying three months, premiums in advance, and he pays the same amount which applies at that time. At the moment it is 28 cents a week, and this a person can afford. Even if it rises to 35 cents he can afford it, but when it rises from R3 to R44 it is impossible for anybody to pay that.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I am rather at a loss this afternoon to understand the motives of the hon. the Minister in effecting this particular amendment. I seek guidance, and I mean this in all sincerity. As I read sections 38 and 38A of the Insurance Act I understand them to have been inserted with the express object and purpose of protecting the family of the man who gives his life for his country; in other words, the man who goes on active service and is killed. Those two sections, 38 and 38A, were inserted to provide that no insurer could at any time try to repudiate liability for paying out benefits to the beneficiaries of a holder of a policy who was killed on active service. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that that is the underlying principle behind those two sections of the Act. Today we have the situation where the hon. the Minister is asking us to add a provision to the Act to the effect that the provisions which are there for the protection of servicemen shall not apply in the case of a group life policy.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>May not apply.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>May not apply? I am sorry. Actually it says &#x201C;shall not apply&#x201D;; whether it is &#x201C;may&#x201D; or &#x201C;shall&#x201D; possibly makes no difference; it is probably the same thing in this context. These provisions shall not apply in the case of any life policy which is a group life policy as we understand it. But, Sir, there are two conditions that pertain because there are different types of group life policies. Fortunately, I belong to a scheme&#x2014; and I have belonged to it for an awfully long time, having taken out two policies under a group life insurance scheme in the 1940s when I was still in the Public Service&#x2014;that does not allow for any amendment, and although I left the Public Service a long time ago, I still enjoy the benefits which accrued to me at that time. But the hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that there is a second type of group life scheme and I submit that is why he has two provisions in here. This is our problem with this particular clause. The group life scheme to which I belong is not covered by this provision because the insurer does not have the power to amend any of the insurance provisions or to cancel the policy.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>So my case and the case of those persons who belong to the same group life scheme is clear. No restrictions will be placed on us. But the hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that there are other group life policies to which mainly members of the Police Force, members of the Permanent Force and trade union members as well, subscribe and belong. It is particularly persons who are in lower-paid employment who belong to a group life scheme of this nature where there is the condition that the insurance company may amend the policy provisions or cancel the policy.</p>
<p>I believe that the Government has a responsibility today to protect those people. But by the introduction of this particular amendment the Government is in fact withdrawing the protection of sections 38 and 38A from those particular people because this amendment reads that sections 38 and 38A shall not apply to any life policy under which these two conditions pertain, firstly, that it is a group life policy and, secondly, that the insurance company may amend or cancel the policy. I believe the hon. the Minister should have another look at this. I agree entirely with everything that has been said&#x2014;that we should get down to the root cause and that is not to allow any insurer the power to amend the provisions unilaterally or to cancel the policy. But that is not before the House at the moment, Sir. The question before the House at the moment is the protection which is being afforded to our boys on the border, whether they are in the Permanent Force or whether they are national servicemen. I believe the hon. the Minister should have another look at this. I want to ask him whether he will not consider either withdrawing this Bill or giving us some undertaking that he will take another look at this provision before it goes to the Other Place because I do not believe that it is the intention of the Government to remove that protection from servicemen. I think this provision is wrong in the Bill. I commend that thought to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to confirm what the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers has said. The hon. the Minister may not remember it but I drew his attention to the case of three teachers in the Transvaal who had retired. He referred the matter to the Registrar but nothing could be done about it. The Registrar said that they had not read the conditions printed on the back of the policy sufficiently carefully. I know teachers are not people who think very far, but they ought at least to be good at reading. [Interjections.] Are there still teachers here? It is a fact, as the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers has said, that at that stage the people simply cannot afford to pay the higher premiums that the insurance companies ask. While the case was still pening, before he could make a choice, one of those people died and his estate did not benefit at all. I think that the people we are really worried about are our young men doing military service on the border. Perhaps the Defence Force can come to a suitable arrangement with the insurance companies. Because of the assurance that the hon. the Minister has given us that he will do everything he can, I am prepared to support the clause.</p>

<speech by="#fick">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. J. FICK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as group insurance is concerned there are certain facts that must be borne in mind so that we will not be tempted to summarily condemn all companies that have been concerned with group insurance in the past&#x2014;and it only concerns this Bill now&#x2014;as if they were or are indulging in some form of roguery. The basic idea of group insurance which, as far as I can remember was fairly popular towards the end of the &#x2019;fifties, was to offer substantial cover to large groups of people, particularly young people, at a cheap rate and at a time when they could not afford to pay high premiums. It is exactly at that time of their lives, when they still have children at home, when they have many obligations, debts and so forth, that insurance is necessary, particularly if the breadwinner dies. It is true, however, that one read the conditions properly, one would know that with the passage of time the premiums could either be increased or revised. That is true. But the attitude of the companies was that that initial low premium was the salvation of these people at the time, otherwise they would have been without any cover. And even if they were to withdraw from the scheme at a later stage because of the conditions or because they could not afford the higher premiums at a time when they ought to be able to do so, the companies felt that they had nevertheless served their purpose by providing those people with the necessary cover. To this extent that type of policy is similar to the type of short-term insurance policy that a person takes out to insure his motor-car, his house and so forth. If nothing happens, all well and good. In the case of short-term insurance, one would lose the premiums one has paid in any case, but one has always known that one has had the necessary cover at a time when it was most needed.</p>
<p>Therefore when these group insurance schemes were originally introduced they complied with the basic principles underlying that type of short-term cover. I am merely mentioning this, Sir, without suggesting that it did not create a very difficult position for certain teachers and others when the premiums were increased. Had I been an insurance broker I would in such a case immediately have said to those people: &#x201C;Cancel it immediately. You can get another type of cover.&#x201D; I merely wanted to mention this, Sir, in all fairness to many honourable companies who set out their policy conditions very clearly in their contracts. Unfortunately, many people did not read those conditions. And when certain conditions came into operation at a later stage and people found themselves in the invidious position to which the hon. Senator Swanepoel has referred, many nasty things were said about those companies, companies which had rendered a very good service to those people, a necessary service as regards cover. In fact, those companies were doing those people a favour. I simply wanted to mention that in all fairness, Sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to say much in connection with what the hon. Senator Fick has said because I do not think we are dealing here with the principle underlying group insurance. We are only dealing with it to the extent that it offers cover for people doing their military service. The hon. the Minister has mentioned a scheme&#x2014;I hope I under stood him correctly&#x2014;that is still at the drawing-board stage, a scheme that will be worked out in co-operation with the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance.</p>

<p>And the industry itself. It is a scheme in respect of which the State will be the underwriter. Even if that is, in fact, the case and even if the hon. the Minister introduces legislation of that nature early next session&#x2014;which I hope he does&#x2014;there is, at this stage and until such time as that legislation is introduced, no cover for our young men on the border who are insured under these group insurance schemes.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, the hon. the Minister is now going to exclude these group insurance schemes from the provisions of the existing section 38A. That will mean that the people who are insured under such a group insurance scheme will for all practical purposes be without cover unless they take out private insurance until such time as the scheme which still has to see the light of day comes into operation. I hope the hon. the Minister understands what I am getting at. The fact that the hon. the Minister is now going to exempt these insurers in terms of this clause will enable them not to honour the obligations laid down in the existing section 38A in respect of those people who are insured with them under a group insurance scheme.</p>
<p>There is another matter that I want to raise, Sir. The hon. the Minister has said that in essence this new scheme will be a group insurance scheme in which the State will only be the underwriter. I think the hon. the Minister should in all fairness afford the other group insurance schemes the same opportunity to offer similar cover at the same premium rate, because we cannot give preference to one group insurance scheme, particularly one in which the State is involved, over and above another scheme if the question of competitive premium rates enters the picture at all. I am mentioning this merely so that the hon. the Minister can bear it in mind because I can foresee the anomalies that will arise. People will say that the State has introduced a group insurance scheme from which their particular group insurance scheme is excluded.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, it is still not clear to me why group insurance schemes are being excluded. In most cases group insurance schemes offer insurance for the economically active life of a person and I do not regard that as short-term insurance. I regard that as long-term insurance. Whether or not anyone wants to quarrel about that, one&#x2019;s lifespan is long-term, I think. Even if the hon. the Minister and perhaps the insurance industry itself regard it as short-term insurance I do not think that that is the case.</p>

<p>If that is so it puts the matter in another light entirely. But in discussing this amendment to the legislation the hon. the Minister said in his introductory speech&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Hon. Senators will remember that last year&#x2019;s legislation affecting existing life policies insuring the lives of military personnel was overhauled by a revision of section 38, and that a completely new approach was introduced in respect of new policies in the new section 38A.</block>
<p>If the military authorities do not at this stage themselves have an insurance scheme to which the military personnel contribute a small amount I feel that it would be unwise to accept this legislation. I would be pleased if the hon. the Minister could tell us what the actual situation is.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in reply to the point raised by the hon. Senator Du Toit, I should just like to explain that there is no doubt that quite a few of our young people who are serving on our borders are covered in some or other way. It is a matter between themselves and their insurance companies. I shall not be able to give him the ratio to the total but, as I have already said, quite a few of them are covered.</p>
<p>I should also like to tell the hon. Senator Swanepoel that in respect of this new scheme which is being drawn up&#x2014;and very good progress has already been made for we did not start with it just recently; we have already reached an advanced stage&#x2014;it will not be necessary to introduce legislation in that regard, i.e. the scheme in which the State Act acts as reinsurer. The hon. Senator will remember that we made provision for this in enabling legislation last year&#x2014;I think it was in the Finance Act. As soon as we have the final scheme before us therefore, we can quickly approve and implement it.</p>
<p>†Mr. Chairman, I cannot help thinking that to an important extent we may be talking at cross-purposes. I am completely at one with all hon. Senators when they express their concern for the man on active service and when they maintain that he should be in a position to obtain reasonable life cover. I think the whole House and myself are <i>ad idem</i> on this point. Indeed, that is why we, together with Defence and the insurance industry, have been making these concerted efforts, and the talks and negotiations have been extremely constructive and valuable. But in regard to group policies we face the position where in these policies it is stipulated that the policy can be amended or even cancelled. Let us just put the active serviceman aside for the moment and look at my problem. When we amended section 38 last year we should, strictly speaking, have excluded these group policies which in writing make provision that they may be amended and even cancelled, because we are now clashing with a contract entered into between the person who takes out the policy, the insured, and the insurer. We should have regularized the position in that case, something we did not do. That is all we are trying to do now and, quite frankly, we have to do it. As I, and also the registrar and our law advisers see it, we must do that. We cannot put that insurance company in an untenable position. The insurer has entered into a contract with the insured person who has agreed to the provisions contained in the contract. Let us assume that the policy (contract) can be amended in different ways and that it can even be cancelled. But now, because the State has amended something else, we have or may have put the insurer in a position where he may have to forgo the whole actuarial basis of the policy and be forced to continue its operation without amendment or cancellation. That is the position some of the insurers will be in. I appeal to hon. Senators therefore to try to appreciate that position and to realize that as far as this Bill is concerned we are now trying to regularize the position. At the same time, however, we are going ahead with all speed to put something very much better in its place for the persons concerned. We are making excellent progress and, in fact, will give priority to this new scheme being worked out with Defence and the industry just as soon as we have it in its final form.</p>
<p>I know my time is up, Mr. Chairman, but I want to point out that that is the dilemma I find myself in, and it does not affect my very strong feeling that we must meet these people. We are, however, trying to do so in a proper way, but we cannot do it by in fact insisting that the law must state that a scheme shall continue unchanged while in fact the contract between the insurer and the insured provides that the policy can be changed and even cancelled. I hope hon. Senators will see that position.</p>

<heading>DIAMOND CUTTING BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-mines">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Since its acceptance, the Diamond Cutting Act. (Act No. 33 of 1955), has never been amended or adjusted. Many of the provisions of the Act have become outdated and obsolete and no longer meet today&#x2019;s needs. Among other things, the Act has not yet been decimalized and there are glaring deficiencies that make effective control over the diamond cutting industry impossible. There are irregularities and malpractices in the industry which, owing to inadequate legal authority, cannot be eliminated or checked.</p>
<p>Since 1955 the diamond cutting industry has remained virtually static and has even shrunk, because the number of large diamonds on which the South African diamond cutting industry was based has gradually dwindled, and the quantity of small diamonds which could not be processed in South Africa has gradually increased. In the middle of 1976, for example, there were only 1 050 White artisans in the diamond cutting industry, and this number would in time have dwindled further and the industry as a whole would have decreased in size until eventually it would virtually have disappeared, unless steps could be taken to process a large quantity of small diamonds in South Africa.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1976, after a strike of nine weeks by White artisans that completely paralysed the diamond cutting industry, a start was made with the processing of small diamonds, viz. diamonds ranging from 0,50 carats to 1,50 carats, by Coloured and White operators who had not undergone the customary period of apprenticeship. Since then, the diamond industry has more than tripled. Whereas there were approximately 40 diamond cutting industries in 1976, by the end of 1978 there were 51 factories employing, apart from about 1 100 White artisans, approximately 2 500 Coloured, Asiatic and White operators, whereas in addition, approximately 400 automatic cutting machines, minded by operators, were already in operation. It is estimated that by the end of this year approximately 3 500 Coloured operators will be employed and the number of automatic cutting machines will number approximately 800.</p>
<p>To illustrate the growth of the diamond cutting industry I might mention that as against the 642 000 carats of uncut diamonds processed by the industry in 1975, by 1976, 694 000 carats were already being processed, in 1977 approximately 944 000 carats and in 1978 approximately 1 200 000 carats. The money value of the uncut diamonds processed in the years mentioned is approximately R134,25 million, R155 million, R218 million and R294 million respectively. It is conservatively estimated that in 1979, 1,4 million carats of diamonds to the value of approximately R450 million will be processed in South Africa.</p>
<p>It will be clear to hon. Senators from this data that there has been a tremendous increase in diamond cutting activities in South Africa. Apart from the far greater volume of diamonds processed here, an entirely new type of labour is being admitted to the industry. This sets new requirements and creates new problems which cannot be effectively dealt with under the existing outdated legislation. It has therefore become necessary to revise the legislation and adapt it to the changed circumstances. Therefore this Bill at present before the House repeals and replaces the Diamond Cutting Act of 1955.</p>
<p>A few glaring deficiencies in the existing Act that must be rectified, are&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) the scope it affords the diamond cutters, owing to inadequate definitions, to export semi-or partially processed dia monds as cut diamonds. There is inadequate control of the export of cut diamonds. In a recent case in which a diamond cutter was charged with having attempted to export as cut diamonds semiprocessed diamonds which should in fact have been classified as rough diamonds, the accused was found not guilty and discharged. What this amounts to is that no steps can be taken to ensure that diamonds are fully cut. In fact, therefore, there is at present no legislation by means of which to exercise proper control of diamond cutting;</li>
<li>(b) the existing loopholes for the illegal export of rough diamonds by diamond cutters owing to inadequate control and outdated penal provisions which in many respects hinder the operation of other legislation, for example the Precious Stones Act of 1973 and the Diamond Export Duty Act, 1957. Exploitation of these two loopholes could cost the State millions of rands per annum in foreign exchange;</li>
<li>(c) the ineffectual control of the employment and movement of employees in the diamond cutting industry;</li>
<li>(d) the lack of co-ordinated marketing of cut diamonds, for example in South Africa there is no recognized diamond market such as in Belgium and Israel, despite the fact that the South African diamond cutting industry has existed from as far back as 1928;</li>
<li>(e) the total lack of statutory provisions by means of which to impose restraint on under-invoicing of cut diamonds. There is no doubt that this malpractice costs the country a large sum in foreign exchange annually; and</li>
<li>(f) the lack of statutory powers to restrict the sale of diamond cutting works to totally foreign interests.</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter shortcoming is due to the fact that as the Act stands at present, there is nothing to prevent diamond cutting factories being sold to foreign persons or bodies. What then happens in practice is that diamonds sold locally at a 10% discount are processed here and then exported at a value which only makes provision for the purchase price plus production costs. The profit on the cut diamonds is taken by the foreign enterprise which possesses the factory abroad, and is not returned to South Africa in the form of foreign exchange. In essence, what this amounts to is that the State is subsidizing the cutting of diamonds by such foreign enterprises to the detriment of the country. Provisions in this Bill now provide authorization to prohibit the sale of the controlling interest in diamond cutting factories to foreigners in such instances.</p>
<p>I want to put it clearly that there is no effort or intention to discourage the investment of foreign capital in the local processing of diamonds. However, there are malpractices in regard to the sale of diamond cutting factories which must be restricted in the interests of the State. Hon. Senators must bear in mind that in order to encourage the local processing of diamonds, local cutters purchase diamonds at a price 10% lower than the London price at which all other cutters from other countries have to purchase diamonds. In fact this 10% is donated to the local cutting industry by the State because the State forfeits 15% export duty on all diamonds sold locally. Apart from that, producers of diamonds sold to the cutters, also benefit by 5% at the expense of the State. The advantage of a discount on the London price to local cutters is intended to encourage the local processing of diamonds. This is in place of the so-called processing subsidy&#x2014; that is the tax concession&#x2014;which is received by any other enterprise, for example mines and refineries that process minerals locally or refine them to a greater or lesser extent. Therefore the discount does not constitute unfair preferential treatment for diamond cutters, but then South Africa must derive the benefit, and not foreign persons or bodies that have no assets here or any loyalty towards South Africa.</p>
<p>The diamond cutting industry and the trade in cut diamonds is an extremely sensitive enterprise. In order to bring about greater co-ordination and improved co-operation among the State, diamond producers, the cutting enterprises and employees, a more representative Diamond Cutting Board, on which all these interested bodies will be represented, is being established. At present the Diamond Cutting Industry Board only consists of five Government officials and is regarded on the one hand as a bureaucratic and on the other as an obstructive institution to which the diamond producers, diamond cutters and diamond cutting employees attach little value.</p>
<p>The bigger board is being clothed with wider powers to control and develop the diamond cutting industry effectively without in any way derogating from the authority of the Minister, the S.A. Police, etc. The board can devote itself to the development of the industry into the important earner of foreign exchange which it ought in fact to be. South Africa is the only important diamond producer that is also an important diamond cutting centre. It is in South Africa&#x2019;s interests that its diamonds are utilized to the full and I believe that this Bill is now establishing the foundations on which a sound and disciplined diamond cutting industry can be developed. In order to permit of adjustment from time to time as needs arise and to facilitate essential adjustments, provision is made for the promulgation of regulations covering a very wide field.</p>
<p>In terms of the Bill, statutory power is being granted, <i>inter alia</i>, to assist the Minister of Finance and bodies and persons under his control to exercise exchange control over the export of cut diamonds by way of the promulgation of regulations by the Minister of Mines in consultation with the Minister of Finance, in order to exercise due control over the export of diamonds and, if necessary, to subject diamonds intended for export to impartial valuation in certain instances. As a whole, the Bill is aimed at establishing proper order and discipline in the diamond cutting industry, an industry which is continuing to grow and is of increasing importance, without smothering it.</p>
<p>The penal provisions have been drastically revised in order to bring the penalties for offences, many of which are just as serious as and even more serious than illicit trade in rough diamonds, into line with the penal provisions in other Acts, <i>inter alia</i>, the Precious Stones Act, 1973.</p>
<p>The Bill has no financial implications for the State. Except for minor indirect expenditure, the administration of the legislation as a whole will be financed from funds levied from diamond cutting factories by the Dia mond Cutting Board and from licence fees payable to the board in terms of provisions of the Bill.</p>
<p>This Bill enjoys the approval and support of all the interested parties, viz. the interested diamond producers and the employers and the employees in the diamond cutting industry. The Bill has also been submitted to all other Government departments with an interest in the matter and is accepted by them in its present form. The Bill does not contain any controversial principles and I therefore have no hesitation in submitting it to the House as an agreed measure.</p>
<p>Mr. President, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill I make so bold as to say that this is actually legislation that has been held in abeyance for a long time. This legislation enjoys general support and at this stage it is most necessary for us (a) to save a large amount of currency, (b) to eliminate shortcomings, and (c) really to encourage the industry to take the important place in our economy that it ought to take.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, when I looked at the title of this Bill it struck me that I have a brother by the name of Diamond and that he sometimes makes cutting remarks, particularly when he talks about some of the activities of hon. Senators opposite! I wondered whether this Bill was intended to control his &#x201C;uitlatings&#x201D;! However, when I read the Bill I realized it was a different kind of diamond we were talking about, namely the diamond that is called a &#x201C;gem&#x201D;, and that, of course refers to the gems of wisdom that come from these benches. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>Joking aside, Sir, the diamond industry is a very important industry to South Africa. As the hon. the Minister has said, it was something like a quarter of a century ago that the original legislation was introduced to control this very important business. It is correct that it should be properly controlled and that new legislation should be introduced and that that legislation should be effective. The hon. the Minister has made it quite clear that this Bill seeks to control malpractices and to close loopholes that have existed over the years. The hon. the Minister has referred to the lack of control that exists and the loss of income to the State through under-invoicing and other malpractices that exist at the present time. He has referred also to the question of the encouragement of the local diamond cutting industry with which I think we on these benches agree.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to have heard from the hon. the Minister that all the interested parties have been consulted and that they have agreed on this measure. It is important to consult them and when we can obtain the agreement of all the people concerned, it shows that we probably have very good legislation.</p>
<p>I should like to refer to one or two of the clauses. The one to which the hon. the Minister has referred, deals with the Diamond Cutting Board. This board will now consist of at least eight and not more than 10 people appointed by the hon. the Minister. When one looks at the categories of people from which the members will be appointed one can accept that this will be a very representative board and one which should be able to look after the interests of all concerned in the diamond cutting industry very well indeed.</p>
<p>I think the regulations have been satisfactorily drawn except in one respect, and that is why I have an amendment on the Order Paper. Clause 14 states that the Minister &#x201C;may&#x201D; require the books to be audited. In my opinion experience has shown that the books must be audited and that is the reason why I have put the amendment on the Order Paper.</p>
<p>I want to come back to the figures quoted by the hon. the Minister to show that the value of the diamonds that will be cut in this country during the current financial year will be something of the order of R450 million, which is not a small amount in anybody&#x2019;s language. Approximately 1,4 million carats will be cut.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has also said that the larger-sized diamonds from which the gems have been cut in the past are gradually petering out and that more and more small diamonds are being cut. He also referred to the increase in the number of Coloured people who are employed in this very important trade. I am very pleased that we have been able to provide employment for these people and that in terms of this legislation they will be adequately looked after.</p>
<p>I feel that I must associate myself with those hon. members in the Other Place who appealed for the establishment of a diamond market in this country at the first available opportunity. The hon. the Minister did refer to this in his remarks and I do not wish to elaborate very much more on this. However, I do feel that this is an important factor because if we could sell the diamonds in South Africa instead of having to use markets in Europe, we would perhaps draw more trade and encourage the industry even further in this country.</p>
<p>I do feel that the legislation before us is very comprehensive. It is good legislation. It is something that will encourage the local industry, block loopholes and discourage misdemeanours, and I have great pleasure on behalf of the New Republic Party in supporting this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. President, we on this side support the hon. the Minister in regard to this legislation. I do not want to make a long speech about a matter which I support. I have acquired a good deal of practical knowledge about diamonds and I could speak all afternoon on the diamond industry if I wanted to. The only comment I want to make is that I find it noteworthy that in a country like Israel, which does not produce a single diamond, diamond cutting is the third largest industry today. I do not see why we in South Africa who produce diamonds cannot expand that industry so that we cut as many diamonds as possible in this country.</p>
<p>We know the success achieved in processing our gold into Kruger Rands. I think we can all learn a lesson from this as far as the diamond industry is concerned. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on giving attention to the question of diamond cutting after taking over this portfolio. I hope that this industry will expand under his competent control so that we can process our own products. I think we could become the largest producer of jewels in the world because we have the gold, platinum and diamonds and the necessary basic minerals.</p>

<p>Mr. President, having listened to the hon. Senator who is an absolute authority on the diamond industry in all its facets, I do not want to argue with him.</p>
<p>I rise merely to support the legislation because I think it is very important for South Africa. We heard recently how the oil producers were threatening us but, fortunately, we have minerals like gold, diamonds, etc. with which to resist them. I am very pleased to be able to support this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-mines">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I thank hon. Senators for their support for this legislation and I want to make just one remark. What we now have before us in the form of legislation is really a culmination of an earnest endeavour extending over a long period to rid this industry of a number of evils and also to expand it. If hon. Senators will be patient for a moment, I should like to explain to them that the cutting of small diamonds is a new development of very great importance. What is actually happening is that the total quantity of large stones is diminishing; in other words, there is a downward curve. The average size of larger stones is also becoming smaller. Because mining methods and the methods of recovery have changed completely, more small stones are being mined. In other words, in future the world will have to be satisfied to accept the fact that large diamonds are disappearing while composite stones, the so-called &#x201C;clusters&#x201D; are taking their place. This tendency is becoming more marked.</p>
<p>South Africa possesses a large quantity of these small stones. In the past we did not really pay much attention to them but specialized in the more sophisticated cutting of large stones. In the future these large stones will become so scarce that the industry will simply either disappear or become much smaller. The fact that we are now changing over to cutting the ever-increasing quantity of small stones means that we are not only injecting new life into the industry but also that many more people will be employed, as I have already indicated.</p>
<p>It is therefore a very big development. As far as I am concerned, one of the shortcomings that we in South Africa have, unlike Israel and other countries, is that we do not have a large diamond market, that is, a place to which people come from all over the globe to purchase South African-cut stones. That, as I have just said, is a shortcoming and I hope the industry will develop in this direction. The hon. Senator Dr. Loock quite rightly pointed out that Israel which does not mine a single diamond, exported small diamonds last year to the value of R1,4 miliard. More than 30 000 people work in Israel at present as cutters of small diamonds. In fact, they process 85% of the world&#x2019;s small diamonds. I hope South Africa will also take its rightful place in this sphere.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Bozas has an amendment, Sir, but in my view we need not even debate it during the Committee Stage because I shall reply to it now. The hon. Senator suggests that there should be an obligatory audit of the books. Mr. President, the bookkeeping involved here is not complicated and will not cost a lot of money. The Bill provides that the Minister can do this. I myself, and I think any other Minister would do it as well, will give instructions that the books are to be audited if necessary. But the hon. Senator is correct; if the Minister can apparently do it, why then is it not laid down in the Bill? This Bill seeks to give the Minister some protection and is rather negative, while the hon. Senator wants it to be more positive. I do not think it makes such a big difference but because of the goodwill and the support which the Opposition have given to the Bill I shall accept the amendment. For the 5% benefit which acceptance will bring about, I accept the amendment. At the same time I should like to give my reasons to those who might want to argue against me. Although I myself have introduced the Bill in its present form, I agree that it may be advisable to include that further obligation, and that is why I shall accept the amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>As hon. Senators are aware, the National Institute for Metallurgy (NIM) was established in 1965 as a State research institute with the aim of promoting metallurgical research in the Republic.</p>
<p>In terms of section 1 of the National Institute for Metallurgy Act, No. 90 of 1965, the word &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; includes the territory of South West Africa. When the Act came into operation in 1965, the Black States that have already achieved their independence from the Republic had not yet come into being, and consequently until a few years ago NIM was able to carry out research in terms of the Act in the Republic, including Transkei and Bophuthatswana. Transkei and Bophuthatswana have in the meantime become independent and Venda is going to follow suit in the near future. It may be expected that South West Africa will also become independent in the near future. In the past NIM has sent some of its officials to Rössing in South West Africa for relatively long periods to carry out research at the uranium mine there.</p>
<p>†As it seems unlikely that the Governments of the independent Black States will be able to establish their own research institutions within the foreseeable future and as NIM is authorized to undertake research only within the borders of the Republic, it is proposed that Act No. 90 of 1965 be amended so as to empower NIM to carry out research outside the Republic in certain circumstances, in any country which requests such research&#x2014;in other words, not only in the Black States which have recently become independent. The research will take place at the request or with the prior approval of the Minister and on the terms and conditions approved by the Minister. NIM is prepared, on request, to undertake research in another country on condition that it is indemnified against losses which may be suffered in consequence of any act or omission of the Government of such a country. Provision is therefore made in the Bill for the issuing of such an indemnity by the Minister of Mines with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance. Parliament passed similar measures during the 1977 session whereby the CSIR was authorized to undertake research outside the Republic.</p>
<p>*The same allowances, such as housing allowances and holiday savings bonuses, as are paid to officers and employees in the Public Service are also paid to the employees of NIM, with the approval of the Minister of Mines and the concurrence of the Minister of Finance. Every time an adjustment in the allowances of public servants is made, the corresponding adjustment in regard to the staff of NIM has to be approved by two Ministers. It is therefore proposed that the Act be amended to provide that NIM may pay its staff the allowances which would have been payable to them if they had been officers and employees in the Public Service. Such an amendment will facilitate the administration of staff matters. Hon. Senators will note that it is also proposed that the wording of the section in question, namely section 7(2), is also being improved in two other respects, and this is being done in order to state clearly that the remuneration of officials and employees of NIM, and the conditions of service to which appointments are subject, may be adjusted from time to time. Similar measures were passed during the 1976 Parliamentary sesstion in regard to the remuneration, payment of allowances to and amendment of conditions of service relating to the staff of the CSIR.</p>
<p>It is desirable that NIM should be authorized to receive assistance in regard to its research by officers in the Public Service seconded to NIM in terms of section 13(6) of the Public Service Act, 1957. It is also desirable for it to be possible for an officer or employee of NIM to be seconded to the service of the State or another State or any other board or body in connection with research. NIM often undertakes projects on behalf of and in co-operation with State institutions, other statutory boards etc. It may happen that the most practical method of carrying out such research is by seconding an officer of NIM to the service of another body. Legal authorization would also be necessary before an officer of NIM could be seconded to one of our neighbouring States, for example, in connection with research.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the measures proposed in the Bill are not of a contentious nature and I trust that they will enjoy the support of all parties in this House.</p>

<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the National Institute for Metallurgy has done some very valuable work in the past and has been a great asset to South Africa. It has been operating in neighbouring states and in South West Africa and it is only correct that it should help the independent Black states, which were part of the Republic in the past, and continue to help them. The same applies as far as South West Africa is concerned.</p>
<p>Furthermore it is quite right that this institute which has the knowledge should be able to help with research in other territories with which the hon. the Minister may enter into such an agreement.</p>
<p>The officials and employees of this institute have expert knowledge and have been conducting research for a number of years. They have produced excellent results and their help can only be beneficial to other countries. At the same time the experience which they gain there as a result of their research can also be beneficial for South Africa. On that particular score therefore nobody should have any qualms about supporting this particular provision.</p>
<p>As far as clause 2 is concerned, I do not think that anybody can have any complaints. This clause provides that in the event of the adjustment of the allowances of civil servants, such adjustments can be brought about automatically in respect of the employees of the institute instead of having to obtain ministerial approval. This is an improvement. There is also the provision that special allowances may be paid under certain circumstances and we support this provision without reservation because one cannot always equate the work of a research worker in an industry like this with the work of a clerk. There is therefore every justification for differentiation in this respect.</p>
<p>I also think that nobody will object to the provision whereby the staff of the institute can be seconded to any other State department. With these few words, on behalf of the Opposition I support the measure without reservation.</p>

<heading>OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES IN MINES AND WORKS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-mines">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to a general increase in the compensation payable in terms of the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act of 1973. Hon. Senators will recall that compensation payable for accidents was adjusted earlier this year and that the hon. the Minister of Finance also announced an increase in social pensions. The position of workers in mines and works suffering from occupational diseases and those who run the risk of contracting such a disease, had therefore to be reconsidered. A decision was taken to grant a 10% increase in all benefits. This is within the means of the State account from which pensions are paid and is also within the means of mines and industries that are responsible for new benefits.</p>
<p>The other amendment being proposed is a simple one, and is being included while the opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>The position of a mineworker who contracted ordinary, infectious tuberculosis but has been cured of it, is that he may, in terms of the existing wording of the Act, be permitted to perform this work for at most 100 hours in any period of 30 days. The restriction, which was aimed at protecting cured sufferers from tuberculosis from excessive exposure to dust, gives rise to practical problems, and what is now being proposed is that the director of the Medical Bureau should himself have the discretion in every case, on the basis of the medical evidence, to decide on the periods for which cured tuberculosis sufferers may perform risk. work It therefore goes without saying that the Director will be able to adjust the period to the man&#x2019;s physical condition, but particularly to the nature and degree of the risk to which he will be exposed. In addition, medical science has made progress in regard to the cure of tuberculosis and therefore greater flexibility in the legal provision is called for.</p>
<p>And so, Mr. President, as this Bill is intended to adopt a situation to the advantage of the workers, I take the liberty of moving this motion in the hope that it will also receive the full support of this House.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I hasten to assure the hon. the Minister that we shall give this our unreserved support. The provision for the improvement of the benefits paid to the people suffering from occupational diseases by up to 10% is something we have no quarrel with. Of course, we would have even less quarrel if it were 20%, but we realize we must be realistic and we accept that the improvement will be to the benefit of those people whose health has suffered as a result of their occupation.</p>
<p>As far as the second clause is concerned, Sir, where the limitation of 100 hours has been removed over a period of 30 days, I have no quarrel at all with the hon. the Minister. As he has said, each case will be treated on its merits and the director there will be able to assess each and every individual case as the facts justify. This is an improvement on the existing provisions. With that I tender our support for the legislation without reservation.</p>

<p>I would assure you, Sir, and the hon. Senate that in this Bill there are no departures in principle from the Act of 1959, i.e. the University of Cape Town Act, 1959. The amendments embodied in this Bill are simply modernizations and administrative provisions to make for the better operation of the university. In fact, many of these amendments are modelled to an extent upon the constitutions and the acts constituting the newer universities, although this is a very old university indeed and one with a very proud record. Of course, as time proceeds and as circumstances change it is necessary to modernize and streamline and all the provisions here which are set out in the preamble are in fact modernizations and streamlining of the existing Act.</p>
<p>There is no departure in principle from the existing Act. I can assure the Senate of that fact. I therefore do not intend to take up the time of the Senate by going through the whole Bill and explaining each of these amendments, but I shall very happily do so if there are any questions in my reply to the Second Reading.</p>

<heading>CAPE OF GOOD HOPE SAVINGS BANK SOCIETY AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Cape of Good Hope Savings Bank Society, the oldest savings bank in South Africa, commenced operations on 25 June 1831 in a double-storied house in St. George&#x2019;s Street, Cape Town. The deposits it received amounted to R5 000 within five days, and on 7 July 1831 it made its first loan of 15 000 rix-dollars, the equivalent of about R1 800, to one E. W. Morrison against security of a first mortgage on his house in St. George&#x2019;s Street, Cape Town.</p>
<p>Right from the start the bank conducted its affairs in a logical, cautious and conservative manner, and had particular regard for the small man. It was this sound policy which entrenched the bank over a period of almost 148 years in its position as one of the safest financial institutions of its sort in the Republic of South Africa.</p>
<p>The bank was established before the emancipation of the slaves and the start of the Great Trek This pioneer bank is unique in this respect that it has no shareholders and the largest portion of its profits goes to reserves. Since 1938 approximately 10% of its net profits each year have been distributed among approximately 150 charitable, aid and training institutions. The total amount paid out over the past 39 years to these praiseworthy institutions amounts to R300 475. To date, special donations have been made to each of the following universities, viz. the University of Cape Town, the University of Stellen bosch, the University of the Western Cape and the University of South Africa.</p>
<p>On 1 May 1967 the bank opened the first of its new series of branches in its own new premises at Parow, Cape. The bank now has eight offices spread throughout the Cape Peninsula. They all have computer programmes for depositors&#x2019; accounts and offer exceptional banking facilities.</p>
<p>The period since the passing of Act No. 33 of 1934, the present legislation, and the drastic changes that have taken place in practices and methods implemented by banking institutions, have made it necessary to review the statutes of the bank and to amend them once again. The reason for the aforementioned amendments is briefly: Change in the behaviour and attitude of clients; change in competition for funds; change in legislation and monetary policy. The bank not only does business in a fluid and highly competitive market but will also shortly alter its role from that of savings bank service to that of a general bank when it is reclassified by the Registrar of Banks in the near future.</p>
<p>The bank acknowledges the need to comply with the changes on which clients insist and wishes to show positive proof that it is changing with the times. Because banks throughout the Republic of South Africa have become active in regard to the institution of new improvements and systems during the past ten years, this bank is also anxious to do so, especially in order to comply with the requirements of the more sophisticated client. The bank is therefore obliged to find new and improved services to attract a client and his business and to retain them. To bring this about, the bank has now found that changes to its legislation are necessary. In addition, the amendments proposed are aimed at rationalizing the bank&#x2019;s articles and adjusting them within the framework not only of the new bank and the new Companies Act but also of sound and modern business principles.</p>
<p>With this object in view the bank has proposed the present legislation and its amendments, which I shall not read out now as they are self-evident, to achieve the objective of becoming a modern commercial bank. For this purpose the proposed amendments to its constitution relate to affairs additional to those the bank is at present authorized to conduct and are in no respects undesirable, particularly when it is remembered that the bank will shortly be reclassified from a savings bank to a general bank.</p>

The Cape of Good Hope Savings Bank Society is an institution which has assumed a special place in our history here in the Cape over the years. It is a conservative institution. I know that is so because my own wife, who is a South African of Scottish extraction, supports this bank. She is a conservative woman and so the statement of the hon.

<p>The amendments contained in the Bill are modernizing, but the modernizing is conservative.

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The University of Port Elizabeth which has made remarkable progress since its inception in 1965 is the only bilingual university in the Republic of South Africa and this particular characteristic is highlighted by the very fine spirit that prevails on the campus of the University of Port Elizabeth among the students of the two White language groups.</p>
<p>This university is widely supported by students from the Eastern Cape and from elsewhere in South Africa, and also as far as the canvassing for funds is concerned. The University was opened in 1965 with 320 students and today the students number almost 3 000 while at the last graduation ceremony in 1978, 693 diplomas and degrees were conferred upon students. We of the Eastern Cape can proudly testify to the fact that in the academic, cultural, sporting and various other fields the University of Port Elizabeth is playing its part.</p>
<p>The amending Bill before this hon. House today relates to the various agreements concluded in accordance with the provisions of the National Education Policy Act of 1967, Act No. 39 of 1967, by the University of Port Elizabeth and the Provincial Administration of the Cape Province for the training of primary and pre-primary teachers at the Graaff-Reinet training college and the Port Elizabeth training college, as well as for the training of students to obtain a degree and a higher education diploma in woodwork and metal work at the Graaff-Reinet training college.</p>
<p>As a result of the experience gained in carrying out the duties as provided for in the agreements, it has been found necessary to effect certain changes to the principal Act in order to improve general administration and management and to eliminate certain anomalies. The proposed amendments are mainly concerned with the delegation of power by the council, the composition of the senate, the delegation by the senate of some of its activities and the appointment of lecturers. All the amendments appearing in the Bill, therefore, are regarded as being important and necessary and consequently I trust that the Bill will enjoy the general support of this hon. House.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I also rise to give my support to this Bill. As somebody who has been connected with a university for a long time, one is also necessarily interested in the growth of other and younger universities. As the hon. Senator so rightly said, the University of Port Elizabeth is one of those which have grown most rapidly within recent years.</p>
<p>What impresses me particularly about this university is that where others simply started at a certain place and then grew without there being any sort of master plan in terms of which this happened&#x2014;and we can say that of most of the universities&#x2014;Port Elizabeth had the special advantage that it had an extensive area available so that planning could take place as far as one could see into the future. Each time I go to Port Elizabeth it is always a privilege for me to have a look at how systematically the university has grown. Each time new buildings have been erected. The sports fields have already been laid out and I can foresee in the years to come, when that master plan has been completed, it will be one of the most impressive sights to see, this University of Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p>It is in this spirit that I support the few amendments moved here this afternoon. I see the necessity for them. I think it is already the custom at other universities for provision of this nature to be made for the smoother running of the administration of the university. We on this side wish to congratulate the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell on the introduction of the Bill. We were also pleased to hear from the hon. Senator Horak that the Opposition supports the Bill.

Delport, Esq., M.P., on whose capable shoulders rested the task of preparing and introducing this Bill in the Other Place.</p>
<p>*It would also be fitting to mention on this occasion that Mr. Delport is a member of the council of the University of Port Elizabeth, that he has played a special role at the university since its inception and that he is still playing a major part in promoting the interests of this very important educational institution.</p>

<p>On a previous occasion I made mention of steps envisaged with regard to agriculture to promote the optimum density of population considered necessary in the national interest in outlying areas. The White depopulation of certain rural areas has given rise to concern for a number of years now, and it has reached the stage where measures to combat it can no longer be delayed. For reasons known to hon. Senators it is necessary for a strong farming community to remain in the outlying rural areas. Uncertain rainfall, unsatisfactory farming income and other problems&#x2014;chiefly of an economic nature&#x2014;are considered to be the main reasons why farms are abandoned.</p>
<p>In November last year a committee consisting of representatives of interested State departments, the Land Bank and organized agriculture was established with terms of reference to investigate this matter and to come forward with proposals concerning what should be done by the authorities to ensure an optimum density of population in the outlying areas which should enjoy a high priority at this stage in the national interest. Subcommittees to deal with the various aspects of the problem were appointed, and the subcommittee in charge of agricultural aspects has already presented its first recommendations to the Government. The areas investigated to date are the areas extending 50 km into the interior from the northern and north-western borders of the Transvaal and 30 km into the interior from the eastern border of the Transvaal south of the Kruger National Park and north of Swaziland.</p>
<p>The steps already approved by the Cabinet comprise the introduction of special measures providing financial support, to encourage farmers at present farming in the areas mentioned to stay there, and to attract new farmers to the area. An obligation will, however, be placed on the receiver of the financial benefits to occupy and control his own property or have it occupied and controlled by a person approved by the Minister of Agriculture. It is realized that these measures alone will not have the desired results and therefore it is necessary and important to compel all agricultural landowners in the areas concerned to make arrangements, within a given time, for the satisfactory occupation and control of their land.</p>
<p>The proposals in this regard already approved by the Government also mean that legislation has to be passed through Parliament to give effect to them. The Bill at present before the House was drafted for this purpose and I trust that it will enjoy the full support of everyone.</p>
<p>†The Bill provides for the designation by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> of areas in which the proposed special measures will be of force and effort. Financial assistance in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1966, will be available to farmers in a designated area on more favourable terms than those which apply to the rest of the country. The rate of interest applicable to loans granted by the Agricultural Credit Board in a designated area is being reduced from 5% to 4%. Loans to approved persons who are not owners of agricultural land to purchase farms in a designated area will carry no interest for the first two years. During the 3rd, 4th and 5th years interest at the rate of only 2% per annum will accrue and become payable and as from the 6th year the interest will be 4% per annum. The capital amount will become repayable as from the 9th year in 25 annual instalments.</p>
<p>Farmers on uneconomic units who have obtained loans in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1966, to increase their farms to economic farming units will pay interest at the rate of only 2% per annum for the first two years and during the 3rd, 4th and 5th years interest at only 4% per annum. The capital and interest at 4% per annum will be repayable in 25 annual instalments as from the 6th year.</p>
<p>In order to assist farmers with existing loans in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1966, the rate of interest payable in respect of such loans is being reduced from 5% to 4% per annum. This reduction will however be subject to recommendation in each case by the Agricultural Credit Board.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the desired results in regard to the occupation of all farms in a designated area provision has been made for special measures in this respect. It will be obligatory for owners of agricultural land in such areas to have their properties occupied and managed in the manner prescribed by the Minister by regulation as from a date to be fixed by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i> Present owners of land will however be given ample time to comply with this obligation. Provision has therefore been made for the promulgation of regulations which will be applicable to each and every farm in a designated area. These regulations will empower the Minister to have proper control over the occupation and control of agricultural land within designated areas and will carry stiff fines in the event of contravention or failure to comply therewith.</p>
<p>*The Government is considering the payment of some form of financial assistance to farmers in designated areas, but a final decision on this matter has not yet been reached. A statement in this regard will therefore be made in due course.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. C. MOLL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want to assure the hon. the Deputy Minister at once that the official Opposition fully supports this Bill. We have often discussed this matter in the past and we realize what the depopulation of the platteland means for South Africa. Now that we have heard that the hon. the Minister consulted organized agriculture as well and that they are in favour of this Bill, I can confirm that we are also in favour of it. The concessions and conditions contained in this Bill are particularly favourable and will serve as a magnet for people to live in the border areas once more.</p>
<p>South African statistics show that the number of farming units decreased by approximately 25% from 1960 to 1977 and that even the quantity of agricultural land decreased from 91¾ million ha to 85 million ha. We had therefore to do something to improve this situation and in my view the Government has now introduced a Bill which will halt this tendency. In connection with stockbreeding the same tendency is discernible.</p>
<p>Mr. President, many farms on the borders are uninhabited because of the fact, as the hon. the Deputy Minister so rightly said, that farming is not a paying proposition. Possibly farming in other parts of South Africa is also not so profitable, but another reason is that the values of farming units on our borders have not risen as rapidly as those of the inland farming units. As a result people in the interior, far from the borders, find it easier to obtain credit than those on border farms, something which is self-evident. This of course also leads to inflation because in areas further from the borders, in other words, the interior, the value of farms is rising at a very quick rate.</p>
<p>In my view many people will make use of these favourable conditions, but in the first place we must bear in mind that many of the border farms are owned by large companies or rich people who do not themselves farm there. Perhaps some of these people will make use of these concessions to exploit people who would like to farm there. That is why I think we will have to be very careful when valuations of land are made there to ensure that people who buy farms there for speculative purposes will not benefit.</p>
<p>One of our former colleagues in this hon. House, for instance, farms on one of these border farms and, for the reason I have just mentioned, i.e. the depreciation in value of the land, he is having an uphill struggle. Twelve years ago he could have sold his land for twice the price he can get for it today. But the fact remains, he is still living there and is one of those who wants to stay there. If this sort of person can therefore also be assisted by the Bill it will mean a lot to South Africa and the South African farmers, especially the loyal farmers who want to remain on the border farms.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I realize that certain areas must receive preference. For instance, the hon. the Deputy Minister spoke of certain Transvaal border areas, but I think we must look a little further and plan more widely. I do not say that more areas must be proclaimed but I think that certain areas in Natal, for instance, should be considered. I did not hear the hon. the Deputy Minister mention Natal, but Mozambique lies on the northern border of Natal and there are also portions of Natal which border on Lesotho. I can assure the hon. the Deputy Minister that some farmers have already left farms bordering on Lesotho. I feel therefore that even at this stage we should see if something cannot be done to help the farmers in those areas. Probably the only reason why this has not yet been brought to the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister is because farmers do not readily leave their farms in Natal because the soil there is particularly good and offers good grazing. For those reasons the farmers stay on their farms. In spite of the fact that border areas in Natal are better agricultural regions than certain parts of the Transvaal, farmers nevertheless do not want to stay there. I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to go into this aspect.</p>
<p>There are a few provisions in the Bill on which I should like more clarity. In clause 3 mention is made of land which can be deproclaimed. What will the position be of a farmer who makes use of the assistance he is now being given to purchase a farm and that farm is then deproclaimed? The real reason he has purchased the land is because of the provision in this Bill.</p>
<p>Clause 5(3) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">When the outstanding amount referred to in subsection (1) is recoverable on account of assistance rendered in respect of agricultural land situated partly within and partly outside a designated area &#x2026;</block>
<p>I think the concept &#x201C;partly within and partly outside&#x201D; will give rise to problems. How can a farm unit be situated partly within and partly outside a designated area? I should like more clarity on this matter. I concede that clause 6 provides that such people will receive assistance in respect of immovable property. We welcome the concessions made in respect of debt on immovable property.</p>
<p>In terms of clause 8 farmers who at the moment own land in those areas will be told, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out, to occupy such property. The Agricultural Credit Board can prescribe to such people that they must occupy the property. I agree with the principle but it does not sound quite democratic. This provision will have to be implemented very carefully because I know the reason why many people bought farms in those areas. However, I support this provision. Clause 8(5) contains the penalty provision in terms of which a fine of not less than R500 or imprisonment for a period of not less than one month can be imposed. But the proviso lays down that any person found guilty of such an offence shall for a period of 90 days after such conviction not be liable to further prosecution for such an offence. It might be worth the trouble for people to pay a fine of R500 every three months and I feel therefore that further consideration should be given to this matter.</p>
<p>With these few words I say again that we on this side of the Senate welcome this Bill. I think it will mean a great deal to South Africa to have a greater density of population on our border farms.</p>

<speech by="#berg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House would like to support this measure. We want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that we are very much concerned to see that agricultural land is retained for the agricultural industry. This measure makes it possible for agricultural land to be used for a dual strategic purpose. I think therefore that the people who are going to settle there not only deserve the sympathy of all the inhabitants of the Republic of South Africa but should also enjoy the support and appreciation of all of us. We are grateful therefore that the hon. Senator Moll has supported this measure. If land in these areas is offered on an experimental basis, we can perhaps look at other regions at a later stage to see whether the same cannot be done there. I had the privilege of being a member of the then Bantu Affairs Commission, and the hon. Senator Moll is quite right when he says that people who own agricultural land away from the border areas have more creditworthiness than people on farms bordering directly upon foreign territories. I do therefore have sympathy with the representations made by the hon. Senator, but it is not for me to reply to them. I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister will reply.</p>
<p>We are not only safeguarding agricultural land by means of this measure. We shall also have more farmers there who will farm productively. We freely support this Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want to assure the hon. the Deputy Minister at once that I support this legislation. In this connection I should like to pay tribute to the Steyn Commission because, as I read the Bill, it seems to me it is the result of the recommendations of that commission. I had the honour of giving evidence before that commission and earlier this session I moved a private member&#x2019;s motion which I think might have contributed somewhat to the promotion of this matter.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter raised by the hon. Senator Moll, i.e. that certain steps envisaged might not be democratic, one must concede that possibly that will be so. But when one takes the situation in the border areas into account, one must bear in mind that this measure, as the hon. Senator G. P. van den Berg said, really serves a dual purpose. Not only will agricultural land in those regions be utilized but the measure will also be instrumental in ensuring that those regions are not completely neglected. I support the legislation wholeheartedly, and I am sure that the farming community in South Africa and organized agriculture will do the same. I also look forward to the implementation of the further recommendations of the commission.</p>
<p>There is another matter which actually falls under the Department of Defence, but the hon. the Deputy Minister of Defence stated in reply to the private member&#x2019;s motion I moved that preference would be given to young men who had already completed their military training. I should like to give strong support to that standpoint because such people will not only be good agriculturists but they will also contribute towards making our borders more defensible.</p>
<p>As the hon. Senator Van den Berg said, this measure will serve a dual purpose and it will also give protection to people living this side of the Liesbeeck River. With these few words I support this Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister-of-agriculture">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I should like at the outset to thank all hon. Senators for their support for this measure. I should also like to reply to a few questions put to me.</p>
<p>I think the hon. Senator Moll displayed a good knowledge of what is happening in the country in respect of the reduction of farming units. The fact that the number of farmers is diminishing is a cause for concern to all of us. But one must be very careful when making such a statement, especially when one realizes that our agricultural production is steadily rising. In spite of the decrease in the number of farmers, our farmers have become more efficient. But I do agree with the hon. Senator that in the outlying regions we shall have to do all we can to ensure that those regions are inhabited. I believe that the purpose of his speech was also to show that we must prevent the number of farmers in these regions from diminishing.</p>
<p>Regarding the hon. Senator&#x2019;s question about exploitation by large organizations and rich people, I think this is a very relevant aspect and we will have to give it very thorough attention. We shall have to use all our powers to see that such exploitation does not take place. But I can tell the hon. Senator that when an application is made for financial assistance for the purchase of this land, it will of necessity be submitted to the Agricultural Credit Board. They will be able to ascertain immediately if the price at which the land is offered is higher than the prevailing price for land in that area. I thank him for the suggestion and I shall definitely give this careful consideration.</p>
<p>Regarding extension of the areas, I should like to point out to the hon. Senator Moll that section 3 provides that the area may be extended by way of proclamation. The Steyn Commission found that the two designated regions should receive the first and highest priority at this stage as a result of circumstances known to everybody here. In my view these regions will shortly be extended to wherever may be necessary. I want to go even further and say that if the funds are available this can in due course be applied to all the borders of our country. I think this will be a logical result of the legislation&#x2014;that it will in due course be applied to all border areas. But one must be very careful in this respect not to designate too many areas at the start so that one can determine what funds are necessary. This is a new measure and one must first find one&#x2019;s feet. I think perhaps in a year or two we shall probably know precisely what the financial implications are and what further regions are needed.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator put a question in connection with section 3. When an area is no longer regarded as an outlying area or an affected area, it can be deproclaimed. I may just tell the hon. Senator that in that case the contract which the man originally entered into at the time of registration of his mortgage will continue until such time as the mortgage is cancelled. That is definitely so; it is a contract concluded with the State and he will enjoy that benefit until the mortgage has finally been repaid.</p>
<p>As far as section 5(3) is concerned, I want to tell the hon. Senator that it can happen that a person owns a unit which falls outside the proclaimed area but which might not be an economic unit. He is then permitted to acquire a unit within the proclaimed area. Those benefits only apply within that area which is proclaimed. This is simply to avoid a man&#x2019;s having a unit 70-80 km from the border and then applying for a unit within the proclaimed area thus deriving benefits from both those regions. This only applies to the region which has been proclaimed.</p>
<p>Regarding the remark about the obligation to occupy I should like to agree with the hon. Senator Van den Berg and the hon. Senator Du Toit. We shall have to impose this obligation on people, but I can give the hon. Senators the assurance that this provision will be very carefully implemented. Of course, it is an infringement on the right of the individual, which we do not lightly undertake in this country, but because of the high priority which this measure enjoys, it will be necessary at some time or other by way of proclamation to compel people to occupy that area. I think we all agree that one must impose this obligation. In spite of the fact that it will be carefully implemented, the obligation must be there and there will be heavy penalties if it is not complied with. It would make the whole operation futile if there were large areas which were not occupied. The whole operation regarding the benefits attaching to the settlement of people would be completely futile if that obligation were not imposed on people who own land there. I hope the hon. Senator will be satisfied if I repeat that it will be carefully implemented.</p>
<p>My thanks too to the hon. Senator Van den Berg. I know he has a wide knowledge of this matter, as has the hon. Senator Du Toit, who, in fact, gave evidence before this commission. I thank both of them for their support in this connection. I should also like to associate myself with the hon. Senator Du Toit who thanked the Secretary for Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, the chairman of this committee, for the speedy and efficient manner in which they tackled this matter. I remember that this matter was initiated in October last year and it is really a record that they produced such a fine report which has led to legislation being passed within a year.</p>
<p>Together with the hon. Senator Du Toit I also feel that the other measures which will have to be taken to make a success of the whole operation will have to be dealt with in due course. Perhaps it might even be done during the next session.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I should like to support the hon. the Deputy Minister. It might perhaps be undemocratic to a certain extent to deproclaim certain areas but provision is made in the Bill for the individual&#x2014;and agricultural land is very highly prized in South Africa&#x2014;if he wants to utilize an agricultural unit, to have the option of appointing a manager or ensuring that it is occupied. I do not think this will give rise to any objections by agriculturists.</p>
<p>As the hon. Deputy Minister has said, it would be futile to expropriate areas and then have large areas in-between which are not occupied, inhabited or properly utilized. It would hamper the whole operation and nullify it. Therefore I should like to support fully what he has said. I think it is necessary and I think any right-thinking person will concede that it is absolutely necessary.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. J. V. MARAIS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I do not think there is a single farmer or exfarmer in this hon. Senate today who feels more satisfied than I do about this Bill. As farmers we find it disturbing that when there is such an enormous hunger for land in this country, it cannot be satisfied. That possibility is now being created through this legislation, and for this we owe a debt of gratitude to the Minister of Agriculture and his deputy. I think this is one of the most farsighted ideas that has come to the fore recently in regard to agricultural matters.</p>
<p>There is a deep yearning to farm in every farmer and anybody connected with farming, and even in some city-dwellers, and the pioneer blood in our Afrikaner people, no matter what language they speak, is always there. The longing is in that pioneer blood to develop things for themselves. A wonderful opportunity is being created here to give expression to that longing to a certain extent There is also the further thought that it will protect our home and if those areas are occupied by people who are properly trained. They have been trained in defence. The young men who come back from border duty at the end of their period of service must establish themselves somewhere, and some of them have the inclination to go in for farming. This is a golden opportunity for them to be able to do so. I trust that this undertaking will be more successful than anything else that has been undertaken recently.</p>
<p>I just want to say to the hon. Deputy Minister that this could be an expensive undertaking. I want to warn those concerned with this undertaking that a vast number of means of production and development will be necessary. If the land is undeveloped, if water has to be provided, if the land has to be fenced, and so on, it will cost a lot of money. If the people are established there and they are not properly equipped to run their farms, they will be disappointed because they will not be able to continue with their farming as they would like to do. We must understand that a lot of things will be needed. The people who are settled there will have to have intensive assistance for the first few years.</p>
<p>But I see that the legislation makes provision for the first five years and we are very grateful for that. I should like to thank the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. the Minister sincerely for this Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister-of-agriculture">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, in conclusion may I just say that as far as the reservations expressed by hon. Senators regarding the infringement of democratic rights are concerned, there are specific financial benefits for the man who wants to farm there. Special steps are taken and the interest rate the people have to pay is well below the prevailing interest rate; even below the interest rate of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators will also remember that in the last part of my introductory speech I referred to the fact that the Government was presently considering measures to give other financial assistance. I cannot spell out today what those measures will be, but hon. Senators can take it that there will be considerable further financial assistance, over and above all these benefits. That being so, the Government surely has the right to impose certain obligations on those people in regard to occupation. That is what it is all about. I think it is justified in the circumstances.</p>
<p>I just want to tell the hon. Senator Marais that he is worrying about nothing. The Government will not put this undertaking into operation, especially not the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure which actually headed the committee, if it is not sure that the farmers already settled there are making a decent living. It would make the whole operation futile if one did not ensure that people could make a decent living there. We in the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure are determined to make a success of this whole operation. I can give that assurance with all the emphasis at my command.</p>
<p>For interest&#x2019;s sake I may just say that since the legislation was introduced for the first time by the hon. Minister of Agriculture in the Other Place numerous inquiries have been received. We believe therefore that things will start happening very quickly once the Act has been promulgated. I believe that we shall soon be reaping the fruits of it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>To answer that question, may I just say that where people own large units, the idea is to divide those farms into economic units&#x2014;units which are regarded as fully economic units. Steps will be taken in due course in regard to occupation so that there will be a provision in regard to each unit concerning its occupation. The further financial measures to be introduced will be based on economic units as well. We hope that the position will develop so that people who own enormously large units will sell voluntarily. If voluntary co-operation cannot be obtained, expropriation may be considered in respect of very large units. In this way we shall attain the objects of the legislation, viz. a greater density of population. I hope that answers the questions of the hon. Senator.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>As a result of projects run by the former Department of Information a large number of activities were undertaken with which the State became wittingly involved. Whether we approve or not is another matter. Whether this was right or wrong is also another matter. The fact is that it was done and the Information Service of South Africa finds itself in the position where we can scarcely expect our officials to undertake the liquidation and management of projects and companies which should never have seen the light of day. The officials of the Information Service, and I do believe of almost any other State department, are not schooled and trained to practise business administration and run private companies in the private sector. The position is that there are quite a large number of companies in which the State has obtained shares. Again, whether that is right or wrong, is not relevant for my purposes at this stage. Shares and rights have been acquired, and they have been acquired with taxpayers&#x2019; money. It is now my function and that of the Information Service to decide how best we may deal with that situation. One finds situations in practice where it might be necessary for the State&#x2019;s shareholding in, say, Company A, to continue for another month, or three months or six or nine months. I must point out that they might even have to continue for another year or two. Hon. Senators might ask why. This is money injected into the private sector; these are shares which in many cases are under the control of boards of directors. There are also innocent shareholders; they are innocent shareholders in the sense that they acquired shares in good faith. The State cannot take a blanket decision at this stage to summarily terminate shareholding and interests acquired everywhere, because then not only will the State and the taxpayer suffer further loss but innocent shareholders and directors might also possibly suffer loss.</p>
<p>Secondly, foreign interests were acquired in certain institutions, organizations and companies. Where interests were acquired in companies which function abroad, one must of course bear in mind that those companies function in terms of the law of the land in which they are registered and sited. This entails a complicated study of the law in the field of company management in the country where a company is registered and in which we have acquired interests. Once again I think it is unfair to expect officials of my Information Service, who are really concerned with modern communication techniques and the psychological combating of action against South Africa, to become experts who have to travel overseas and ascertain there what our rights and obligations are in possible companies and how best we can comply with those rights and obligations and make them payable, depending upon what is in our interest. This calls for expert knowledge. We obviously have no jurisdiction beyond our borders. We cannot make a law which is valid overseas. That we cannot do. But what we can do, and that is the object of the Bill before the House, is to set up a board to which we shall grant certain powers and with which we shall provide the means to enable them to the best advantage and with the least prejudice&#x2014;the two concepts are either side of the coin&#x2014;to deal with and manage the interests of the State and any assets, rights and claims that have been acquired with State funds. That is the crux of the Bill, and that then is the reason for the establishment of the State Trust Board&#x2014;to take control of this complicated matter and to manage such matters and wind them up, as I have explained to you.</p>
<p>The activities of the State Trust Board are defined. I do not want to go into finer details with you but I think hon. Senators would like to know what the main aspects, aims and objectives of this State Trust Board really are. In the first place the main objective is that all rights and assets of the State, as well as all obligations incurred by or resulting from an agreement entered into or purported to have been entered into by or on behalf of the former Department of Information, shall be transferred to the board.</p>
<p>It is further provided that all rights and assets arising from or acquired through the lending or making available of secret State funds by the former Department of Information, whether directly or indirectly, to any individual, organization or company, shall similarly be transferred to the board. We are thus effecting a transfer of all the assets concerned as well as a cession of all rights concerned, to the board, while the board in turns takes on all the relevant obligations of the State. It is only right that one should not only transfer the rights and claims, assets and interests of the State to the board but that one should also make provision for possibly <i>bona fide</i> and innocent members of the public who feel aggrieved or who have been prejudiced and feel there has been a breach of contract or who for any reason might feel they have a claim against the State, to subpoena this State Trust Board so that they may obtain through normal court procedure what is rightfully theirs.</p>
<p>In the second place I want to mention that the board shall enforce such rights and liquidate such assets as may be transferred to it or deal with them in such a manner as to be least prejudicial to the interests of the State. I think it is important that we should bear that in mind, because by means of this expression we are establishing a norm for the board. It must act in such a manner that the State&#x2019;s interests will suffer the least possible prejudice. It is therefore implicit in the obligations of the board that the best interests of the State have continuously to be the guideline in respect of action taken by the board. I should like to add to this idea that the board must act in such a way that the State&#x2019;s interests suffer the least prejudice, that what we actually mean is that in practice one is confronted with a situation where the board serves the State&#x2019;s interests by taking a decision which might be financially prejudicial but which nevertheless is in our interests. A financier might say: &#x201C;No, you should rather have carried on with this thing for a month or two and you would have made a profit of R50 000 or R100 000.&#x201D; I want to make it clear therefore that &#x201C;least prejudice&#x201D; must be interpreted as a norm which the State Trust Board must also follow to avoid political prejudice for the whole State, for all of us, for South Africa&#x2019;s reputation and good name. &#x201C;Least prejudice&#x201D; might also entail that one had to sacrifice R50 000 or R100 000 if it meant that had one continued with a project to reap the profit, one could have caused harm to the country to the tune of millions of rands.</p>
<p>I should like to mention further that should the board be of the opinion that certain rights or assets resulted from the expenditure of secret State funds, a certificate issued by the board to this effect shall be proof that the rights and assets were generated or arose by this means. The onus will rest on the person who maintains the contrary to prove such an allegation. The decision to legislate to shift the onus of proof was not taken lightly. This assurance I should like to give to hon. Senators. It is always borne in mind that it is a fundamental principle of South African law that the onus of proof rests on the person making the allegation. Thus in the case in question the onus should have been on the board to prove that certain assets and rights did in fact originate from secret State funds. As a result of the factual situation, viz. that the transactions in question were in most cases so obscure with the very object of making it impossible to prove that they were founded with State funds, and because the issue here is the recovery of public money, it was decided contrary to normal practice to shift the onus of proof. I want therefore to assure hon. Senators that the decision was not taken lightly but that in the specially unique circumstances of the aftermath of the activities of the former Department of Information, the State might well suffer severe losses if it did not have this remedy available.</p>
<p>Just to give you one example. We could have the position of a man overseas at the moment, perhaps a foreigner, he need not even be a South African. Say, for instance, millions accrued to him from money which the former Department of Information put at his disposal and which we cannot recover from him because he is abroad and falls under the jurisdiction of another government. It may be, however, that such a man has assets in the country. It might even be that the State has a claim for a few million rand against such a person outside our country, while he might have assets in South Africa which could be liquidated through legal channels. Therefore the State must be able in some way to subpoena him&#x2014;and I shall come to this shortly&#x2014;in such a way that the subpoena would be regarded as valid by our courts. Or, if necessary, if there is a reasonable and fair indication that the assets have also been acquired within South Africa with State funds, the board can issue a statement to the effect that in its view that is the case. Then the State will acquire such assets, unless our friend comes back from abroad or wherever he might be and proves here that that is not the case. These are remedies which the board needs. I mention for the information of hon. Senators that the decision to provide these remedies was not taken lightly. We do not lightly deviate from our tried traditional norms and legal principles. But in my view we must give these remedies to the board.</p>
<p>In addition to the statement which the board may issue to the effect that certain assets were acquired through the use of secret funds, unless the contrary can be proved, the board also has authority to subpoena in the following manner. A subpoena can now be published in each of the four provinces in an English and Afrikaans newspaper circulating in that province. The time allowed for appearance will then be 21 days after publication of that subpoena. In the light of what I have already said, I think hon. Senators will agree with me that we really had no other choice but to do this. What is at issue in this case is the <i>audi alteram partem</i> rule, viz. that a man must be given notice that action is to be instituted against him so that he can defend himself if he so desires. That is why we have the rule that court documents and process in litigation are normally served by the deputy sheriff on a defendant, and the deputy sheriff then submits his return to the court as proof that the defendant was in fact served with notice of the action to be taken against him. In this case again it is a remedy we must give to the board. If we do not give this remedy to the board, we will have the situation that claims against certain persons can never be instituted for want of proof that we can serve the subpoena on the man. But he knows about the assets he has acquired. From the point of view of reasonableness therefore&#x2014;I am now speaking informally&#x2014; he knows of the improper or unauthorized expenditure, but he hides away or travels around or carries on in such a way that a subpoena cannot be served at his address. In the meantime, it may be urgently necessary to act in order to protect the interests of the State.</p>
<p>Another main feature of this Bill is that a trust account will be set up for the board. Funds will be deposited in that trust account which the State Trust Board may collect by way of claims or otherwise, as I have already indicated to hon. Senators, as well as funds which Parliament might vote to defray the running expenses of the State Trust Board. I do not know what those costs are going to be, Mr. President, but in the nature of things we shall try to keep them as low as possible. The State Trust Board will consist of at least three and not more than five members and it can co-opt experts. We have tried to make those provisions as flexible as possible so that the State Trust Board will not be restricted in regard to any assistance it may obtain.</p>
<p>Mr. President, to sum up then: We need this mechanism. Within the normal framework of the State set-up we do not have such a mechanism, for the simple reason that we have never previously had to contend with a phenomenon or activities like this. We have no practical experience of this sort of situation but if we appoint expert people to this State Trust Board, people who, for instance, are qualified in business administration or accountancy, etc., we shall, I think, be establishing for all of us, i.e. the State and the taxpayers of South Africa, a mechanism by means of which we shall be able to rectify what went wrong and off the rails in the former Department of Information in the quickest and most orderly fashion.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I see very well the necessity for this Bill which the hon. the Minister has introduced, even the necessity for the somewhat far-reaching modifications of our common law with respect to certain aspects of the processes upon which this board will embark. I understand this necessity very well. But, Sir, I must obviously express my very deep regret that there should ever have been the necessity for a Bill of this sort. I will say no more about that.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has been left with a position in which he has an Augean Stable to clean up. He has to clean up this stable which was not of his making, but he has this onerous task. For this task he has seen fit to suggest in this legislation the appointment of <i>a</i> State Trust Board, and I agree with the hon. the Minister that this is probably the best way of doing it. I agree with him that the Public Service and its agencies are not equipped and neither do they have the time to do this sort of work that the board will be expected to do. Therefore the mechanism of a board of this sort is understandable in these circumstances, the circumstances of this Augean Stable with which this hon. Minister is saddled through no fault of his own at all.</p>
<p>I cannot help remarking though that we in this country are suffering from a tremendous shortage of skilled professional manpower, and it is the unfortunate situation now that we are going to have to devote the time and energies of from 3 to 5 very skilled, professional people who will sit on this board to conduct what, in the best of possible terms, is a rescue operation. The whole thing is a pity but I will not say anything more about that either. We shall support this legislation, Sir, because it is necessary. There is no question about it; it is necessary.</p>
<p>I cannot help remarking though upon the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude in regard to clause 4. The hon. the Minister explains that what has to be done must be that which shall be least prejudicial to the interests of the State. Sir, this is a psychological reaction to everything that has gone before, because one could really say &#x201C;what has to be done shall be most advantageous to the interests of the State&#x201D;. It means the same thing.</p>

<speech by="#schoor">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. M. VAN SCHOOR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, on behalf of this side of the House I wish to express our wholehearted support for this measure and to thank the hon. Senator Horak who, on behalf of that side of the House, has expressed their support for it. He is quite right, in fact, when he says that the less one says about this measure the better. The reason why it is necessary to establish a body such as this is to clean up what he called an Augean Stable. What was done in the past I prefer to call a kind of James Bond undertaking. However, we do not want to elaborate further on this because this is not the occasion on which to do so. The winding-up of these undertakings will be undertaken by a small&#x2014;and I welcome this fact&#x2014;but expert organization, namely, a trust board that can call in expert assistance so as to obviate the possibility of a bigger department being created in order to trace and examine all the machinations of the former Department of Information.</p>
<p>Mr. President, we do not intend asking the hon. the Minister to make any statements which he does not see his way clear to make at this stage, but we naturally take it that this trust board will be established as soon as possible once this measure is on the Statute Book and that it will have sufficient data before it I take it also that that data will be supplied mainly by the Pretorius Committee that investigated the question as to which projects should be continued with, which have been liquidated and in respect of which we find ourselves in difficulties. We trust that this board will go to work as soon as possible and that it will not be necessary for example, for it to start with its own detective agency.</p>
<p>There is one aspect, however, that worries me and perhaps the hon. the Minister could give us some assurance in this regard. Sir, once again we are faced with the old argument that arises in respect of every one of these undertakings, namely that, we trust that the media will give this trust board ample opportunity and freedom to complete its work and in due course to make its findings public in the form of reports tabled in Parliament. We trust that the actions and undertakings of the State Trust Board will not in turn become the subject of speculation, guesswork and scandal-mongering or whatever it may be. As a matter of fact, I hope that the State Trust Board that is to be established in accordance with this legislation will be regarded as a body that has to administer in the best interests of the country the undertakings that have given rise to its establishment. We on this side of the House welcome this measure wholeheartedly and trust that the Film Trust Board&#x2014;unfortunately I cannot get away from the James Bond idea&#x2014;I mean the State Trust Board will be able to finalize its work as soon as possible and that we shall be able to rid ourselves of the hump that we have been carrying for such a long time.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I rise to say that I on my part also support this legislation. Like the hon. Senator Horak I regret that it has become necessary but that is something else again. I think the hon. the Minister has made out a good case for the establishment of a special body to carry out the functions as detailed in the legislation before us. I think he has set out the reasons particularly well. I feel it is a little unfortunate because of the mechanics with which we are faced this afternoon that I have only just in the past two or three minutes received the amendments that were accepted in the Other Place. I do not blame anybody for that, because it is the time of the session when this sort of thing happens. I can also understand that the legislation must not be delayed. I am pleased to see in particular that the hon. the Minister has accepted the amendment on clause 4, because this is the clause which worried me especially. The clause will now have the following proviso&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Provided that wherever practical the Board shall observe the regulations of the Treasury and the Tender Board in the disposal of rights and assets of the State.</block>
<p>I am more than happy that this amendment was accepted and it is only a pity that this Bill was not enforced at the time when <i>The Citizen</i> was disposed of. If it had been, <i>The Citizen</i> would have been put out to tender.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#schoor">

<p>Did you want to tender?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>The hon. Senator has a fine sense of humour, but the point is that the amount paid for <i>The Citizen</i> by the Perskor group was, and I only say this from what I have read in newspapers, a good deal less than might have been obtained if it had been put out to tender. As a result of this the public, the taxpayer, which I am convinced the hon. the Minister is trying to protect as much as anybody else, may have lost a good deal of money. For this reason I think the clause is a very good one. Now that assets of this sort will have to be disposed of through the Tender Board I think the public will at least be spared another <i>Citizen</i> affair, where this newspaper was disposed of by the holders, which were in fact the State at that time, for an amount which was probably a good deal less than might otherwise have been obtained. I would like the hon. the Minister to confirm that my contention is correct, viz. that if this provision had been in force at the time this would have been the only method in which <i>The Citizen</i> could have been disposed of.</p>
<p>I do not intend to deal with other matters because they are all in the melting pot. Quite frankly, I do not know in respect of which of these the State is trying to recover money. I leave that to the board and the various commissions which are studying the position. With these words I support the legislation. I am sorry that it had to come before us, but I agree that there is no other way.</p>
<p>The only other matter I wish to raise is to ask for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that this board will be wound up as soon as it has completed and has fulfilled its functions. One is often faced with the situation that a body of this nature is established and that it seems to be self-perpetuating. It goes on and on and never seems to come to an end. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to assure the House that the moment he believes that all the duties that could be fulfilled by this board have been completed, that he will bring it to an end. That way I hope we will one day see the total end of this unhappy affair. With these words I support the legislation.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#rensburg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the few thoughts I have to express in connection with this Bill, could perhaps be more fruitfully expressed at the Committee Stage but because I am not so sure that there will be a Committee Stage I wish to express them now.</p>
<p>As the hon. the Minister has rightly said, this Bill provides for something that is completely new in our legislation. We all realize that this is something new and I think I am speaking on behalf of everybody when I say that I trust it will never again be necessary to come forward with a similar measure. With reference to the legislation that still has to be introduced in this House, I am convinced that something like this will never again be necessary.</p>
<p>I want to say a few words in connection with clause 6(2)(c) and clause 7(3). Clause 6(2)(c) provides for the State Trust Board to have all the affected shares transferred into its name. As the hon. the Minister has rightly said and emphasized, in this instance we are dealing to a large extent with companies that are registered overseas. It is fairly common practice for a company to provide in its memorandum and articles of association that no company or corporate body shall acquire shares in it, only individual persons. We know that many companies provide in their memorandum and articles of association that only citizens of or persons resident in the country concerned shall be entitled to hold shares in that company. However, there is a method of circumventing this provision. I wonder whether it is not possible in due course to provide in this legislation that all affected shares shall be transferred not only into the name of the State Trust Board but also into the name of a nominee of the board. Such a nominated person can then be a citizen of the country in which the company concerned is registered, whether it be Switzerland, America, Great Britain or any other country. The board can then work in conjunction with such a person who will then hold the shares on behalf of the board. There is a danger that a company with a large shareholding in a certain undertaking may prevent the State Trust Board from having the affected shares transferred into its name. Judging from newspaper reports many of these transactions have been so astutely engineered that one can very easily find oneself at a dead-end. I should like to suggest a possible amendment to the hon. the Minister which he can perhaps put into effect in due course. I foresee that we shall very soon come up against problems such as this.</p>
<p>Reference is made in clause 7(3) to &#x201C;any process&#x201D; and how it is to be served. The words &#x201C;shall be deemed that such process was duly served upon the defendant&#x201D; are also used. The difficulty I foresee in this connection is that we shall not only be dealing with a defendant but in many cases with witnesses as well. I think we shall in due course have to state clearly that any process will also include the summonsing of witnesses. We could perhaps have attached that meaning to &#x201C;any process&#x201D; but elsewhere in the subsection it specifically provides that &#x201C;such process was duly served upon the defendant &#x2026;&#x201D; Here the summonsing of witnesses is excluded from the meaning of the expression &#x201C;any process&#x201D;. We want to be able to serve process not only on the defendant but on important witnesses as well.</p>
<p>It may happen that it is difficult to trace witnesses and that it will not be possible to serve summonses on them immediately. I wonder whether by such an inclusion we shall not succeed in getting hold of such witnesses.</p>
<p>I wish the hon. the Minister every success in the application of this measure. It is something new and I trust it will never again be necessary for him to come forward with something like this. However, this is important legislation and I trust that any loss that the State may have suffered as a result will to a large extent be made good by means of this legislation.</p>

<p>I also want to sympathize with the hon. the Minister that it has fallen to his lot to clear up this matter. Finally, I want to express the hope that the board will complete its task as quickly as possible and that it will be disbanded as quickly as possible.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-foreign-affairs">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I should like to thank hon. Senators for the positive and constructive manner in which this debate has been conducted. It has taken place in a calm, peaceful atmosphere, with an appreciation for the necessity for this measure. I thank them for their attitude and I hope this will be the hallmark of all future discussions on this matter which is really behind us now.</p>
<p>In the first place I want to thank the hon. Senator Horak for his positive approach, and also the hon. Senator Van Schoor whose query, actually, was whether, when the State Trust Board had completed its task, sufficient particulars would be available so that at any time we could scotch any suspicion-mongering, if I understood him correctly. My problem is, as hon. Senators will see when we come to the Committee Stage, that there is in fact a provision which will make the tabling of documents possible. But I must say that this is a matter of principle. I felt I had to include a safety valve in this measure because normally I would not have introduced a measure like this into the Parliament of South Africa. Normally any case could have been dealt with within the State machinery and the relevant State departments by means of toil and sweat and struggling to cope with the available manpower drawn possibly from three, four or five departments. One would just have laboured on; shares might have had to be transferred into the names of individual officials; then again those rights would have had to be ceded to the State Attorney; he would have locked them away in a safe and in this way we would have collected exhibits. And if such an official died we would have to prove to the executors in his estate that those items did not belong to him, as his wife might have thought, but that they belonged to the State, and so on. Normally we could have struggled on and sent officials overseas from time to time when problems arose. Problem situations might have arisen in regard to the law in other countries. We might have had situations where our officials might have become directors of private companies and would therefore have been exposed to the service of a subpoena. If an official were subpoenaed the State would have to provide him with an advocate through the State Attorney and in this way we could have struggled and ploughed on. There was no legal obligation on me to make this law. The decision to make a law is the Government&#x2019;s so as to bring about efficient, open straight and effective administration. That is part of the programme of clean administration, even though its origins spring from negative causes. An efficient administration is tested at its best in a time of resistance, in a time of adversity. A man who can quickly and efficiently deal with a flat tyre can soon be on his way again, much sooner than the man who sits and moans and does not know how to loosen the nuts. That is my contention.</p>
<p>I was not therefore, with due respect to hon. Senators, under any obligation to introduce this Bill. I could have ploughed on and there would have been no obligation on me to call on my officials or the officials of Information, State Security, the Treasury, Finance the State Attorney, or whoever, to submit reports. There would then have been no such obligation as having to compile a report after a period and to table it here. I would not have been under that obligation. The only obligation there would have been on the State would have been to do our work to the satisfaction of the Auditor-General, and that is written into our law. The Auditor-General has that right.</p>
<p>I have accordingly provided in clause 10&#x2014; and I have gone out of my way in this regard&#x2014;that documents may be tabled, with only one safety valve, viz. that if I am convinced that our security or our relations with other countries might be affected, we need not do it. That was suggested by hon. members of the Opposition in the Other Place, and I accepted that suggestion. But hon. Senators will understand that such a State Trust Board is not another commission of inquiry. If we want further commissions of inquiry then hon. Senators must make out a case and say what their allegations are and then the Government must consider them apart from this legislation. But this is a State Trust Board comprising experts in the field of business administration and the field of accountancy, with a certain object in view, viz. to help me ensure that the taxpayers&#x2019; money is jeopardized as little as possible in future or that it is controlled to the best advantage of all of us. That is what it has to do. It cannot order fresh inquiries where legal knowledge and legal decisions will be needed. The police are there for that purpose, or the Advocate-General or other institutions. I am interested now in one objective. I want to put the sadness and the misery of the past behind us and I want the State&#x2019;s interests to be controlled in an orderly fashion; I want my officials and information service free of suspicion. They are still under the shadow and the cloud that resulted from the conduct of other people, conduct of which they are innocent. It is against those undercurrents, that they have to represent South Africa and they are doing their duty superbly and with great honour and integrity, but we must clear the way for them.</p>
<p>When a report is submitted and contains nothing that will harm our relations with other countries, I shall publish everything and lay the report on the Table and say: There are the accounts; so much has been recovered and we spent so much to get it back. I hope we do not have the same experience other people have had. A dentist told me the other day that he had handed his accounts over to an attorney for collection and that the attorney had collected arrears to an amount of, I think, R7 000, but had then sent him an account for R8 000! The attorneys also have to live. [Interjections.] I do not say that is necessarily true, Mr. President. I hope we will not end up in that position, but even if we did, hon. Senators must still concede that I have set up a well-equipped and proper mechanism to get the work done. And when the work has been done we shall table it. All I am asking for is the one safety valve of only having to table that which is not a threat to the State, something which will affect our security and disturb our foreign relations.</p>
<p>†As far as the hon. Senator Winchester is concerned I should also like to record my appreciation for the positive approach adopted by him today. He asked a question which I not only have no wish to avoid, but to which I would like to give a straightforward answer. I am afraid that his interpretation of that particular amendment in connection with clause 4 is not quite my understanding of it. As a matter of fact, the hon. member who moved the amendment in the Other Place stated categorically that he agreed with my interpretations. At first I did not want to accept this amendment and I explained the reason which I should like to repeat here. This Board can, for argument&#x2019;s sake, find itself in the position that in strict compliance with Tender Board regulations and Treasury regulations in a given case, it is unable to fulfil its basic function, viz. to act to the best advantage of the interests of the State in the wider sense of the word. There was the example I gave earlier. Should this board decide that a certain project has im plications of such a nature for the State that its continuance would cause us harm, although some material benefit might be derived from either selling or maintaining the project for a limited period, it would nevertheless be proper for the Board to terminate the project.</p>
<p>Such a decision technically speaking might clash with some regulation. The Tender Board or the Treasury might say: &#x201C;Regulation A(3), or whatever it may be, provides that you should have given two months&#x2019; notice before you did that, or you should have advertised the proposition.&#x201D; In such a case the board must be in a position to say: &#x201C;Look, at that particular moment, I considered all the alternatives and it was impossible to comply with Tender Board regulations or with Treasury regulations without incurring great damage to the country&#x2019;s interests.&#x201D; My point of view is that this board ought to function in terms of and according to civilized norms and standards applicable in this country and with which we all agree. In any case, that should always be the standard. I just wanted to make that clear so that I do not mislead hon. Senators in any way. As a result of that I intend moving, in order to make the position clear in the amendment moved in the Other Place, that the words &#x201C;at its discretion&#x201D; be inserted after the word &#x201C;board&#x201D;, because I was assured in the Other Place by the mover of the amendment that the board would, in effect, have the sole discretion to decide when to follow Tender Board and Treasury Regulations.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Then we have no difference, there is no divergence of views, and I thank the hon. Senator for his contribution this afternoon.</p>
<p>*The hon. Senator Van Rensburg raised some interesting points, especially those in connection with clause 6(1) in regard to the shares we are trying to obtain because the board, for instance, might appoint or nominate some person in another country to protect our interests there by taking possession of shares which must be registered in our name. As I read the provisions, Mr. President, it is implicit in the authority granted to the board to do just that. If the board feels that that is the way in which the State&#x2019;s interests will be least harmed, then, in my view, the State Trust Board already has the authority to act in that way. I thank the hon. Senator for his suggestion; it is a positive suggestion, but it is already implicit in the provisions.</p>
<p>As far as the question of granting power to the board to call witnesses is concerned, that is something we have seriously considered. We considered this very carefully, but I should like to explain the position in this way to the hon. Senator: The board can also be subpoenaed; it can also be the defending party in an action. Suppose a <i>bona fide</i> claimant summoned the State Trust Board for breach of contract arising from the winding up of certain projects. There could be someone&#x2014;I do not know if there are such people and if they will come to light&#x2014;who says that there has been a breach of contract. He could say he accepted Dr. Rhoodie&#x2019;s word in good faith and he could make a sworn statement and produce evidence that Dr. Rhoodie had said to him: &#x201C;Here is an agreement which guarantees my salary for three years and now you are terminating my services.&#x201D; If that agreement can be proved in a South African court then such a claimant can prove his case. We must be reasonable. Just because irregularities have taken place, the State cannot reply with irregularities. We must as far as possible remain true to our norms of decency, fairness and reasonableness. We cannot become sadistic and try to eradicate everybody who might even indirectly have had dealings with the former Department&#x2019;s affairs. We must get this matter behind us in an orderly way. If we now give this State Trust Board the right to subpoena witnesses, then at least it is possible that when the State Trust Board is summonsed, it in turn will be able to summons the claimant who has served summons on it because it will then have the power to subpoena witnesses. Then you have the untenable, the unfair position that such a claimant who subpoenas the State Trust Board can be subpoenaed by the State Trust Board to appear before it and give evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I thank all the hon. Senators for their contributions. I thank them for the positive and constructive manner in which they have dealt with this measure. With your permission, Mr. President, I should like to conclude by saying that the enemies of this country have a big advantage whereas we are suffering a setback. All of us, White, Black, Coloured and Asian, would like to move away from this matter and enter a new era, a new era in which we can give our full attention to our security, our economic development and our political dispensation. As Minister of Foreign Affairs who is perhaps not as involved with internal politics as other members of the Cabinet, I should like in conclusion to make a friendly appeal to hon. Senators: Let us give these powers to this board and let us accept that it will wind up matters in good faith. It will submit a report and the Auditor-General is there. Let us get the sad saga of the Department of Information behind us by means of this administrative procedure and let us look ahead so that we can give our attention to what is important for South Africa&#x2019;s peoples. Otherwise, Sir, we are going to be tied down, and this effort will not only be a weak administrative action but afterwards we will be liquidated by our enemies.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to direct a question to the hon. the Minister which relates to subsection (1). This refers to an affected company. Can the hon. the Minister tell us whether any companies which are defined as affected companies in terms of this definition have in fact been identied; if so, how many companies are there and what amount, according to his information, is involved and can be recovered in the event of proceedings being successful against such affected companies?</p>

I can only say that on the basis of information that is available to me at the present moment, I estimate that there will be about 20 at this stage with the possible addition of another 18.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to move a further amendment because, as hon. Senators can see, the clause has already been amended. I explained the amendment earlier today. The further amendment reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">In B. 109A&#x2014;&#x2019;79 (Assembly) (MS.), in the proviso, after &#x201C;board&#x201D;, to insert &#x201C;at its discretion&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you will appreciate that we on this side of the House are subject to some difficulty as regards this Bill. In the first place the Bill did not appear on the Order Paper and the first knowledge I personally had of this Bill was when it was placed before me. I take it the hon. the Minister will forgive me if I ask certain questions the answers to which might be obvious if I had studied the Bill properly.</p>
<p>The second point that I bring to the notice of this hon. House is that as far as my Bill is concerned there is not reflected therein any wording relating to any amendment that was agreed on in the Other Place. It is not in the Bill that I have before me. I am therefore at a disadvantage as regards that point as well.</p>

<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>I thank the hon. the Minister, and I thank you too, Sir, for the provision of the full text.</p>
<p>I now wish to deal with a point which I think arises out of clause 4 of the Bill. It is a point that has already been referred to by my colleague, the hon. Senator Winchester, and relates to the sale of <i>The Citizen</i> to Perskor. I think it is generally accepted throughout the country by people who are well disposed to the Government and also by the Opposition that it was a mistake to have sold <i>The Citizen</i> at the time it was sold. It was a further mistake to have sold this particular asset in the way that this was done and to the particular company to which <i>The Citizen</i> was sold. I understand clearly from the hon. the Minister that the Government is conscious of the fact that there is a responsibility upon it to receive into the coffers of the State the largest amount of money possible under the circumstances in order to make retribution for the mistakes of the past. With that sentiment I think we on this side of the House agree completely.</p>
<p>I would ask the hon. the Minister to consider the suggestion that I now want to make: That this amendment which he accepted in the Other Place and the amendment that he has just moved be again amended to make this provision retrospective at least to the beginning of this year. This will have the effect of cancelling by statute the deed of sale that was entered into with Perskor in respect of this asset, <i>The Citizen.</i> This asset cost the taxpayer of this country something like R32 million in all. That is what we had to pay out because of this particular blunder by the former department.</p>
<p>From information I gleaned from newspapers, it appeared that the Argus group of companies was prepared to pay a larger amount for <i>The Citizen</i> than was paid by Perskor. If this is correct&#x2014;I cannot vouch for its correctness although I saw no denial of that allegation that was made in the English-language Press&#x2014;then the State and the taxpayers will benefit by this amendment being made to this extent: I take it that if the Argus group was prepared to pay a higher amount than was offered by Perskor and which was accepted as the sale price, the State and the taxpayers would benefit by the difference between the amount that was accepted and the amount that was offered and I suggest might again be offered by the Argus group. It will bring about the very thing that the hon. the Minister wishes to bring about.</p>
<p>I suggest too that it will have another great advantage, and that is that as a result of this particular transaction there has been a tremendous amount of criticism of this Government coming as it did on the heels of all the disclosures that were made of corruption etc. in this unfortunate department. I would say therefore that if the hon. the Minister would accept a further amendment to the amendment that was accepted in the Other Place to make it retrospective I think he would be killing two birds with one stone. Firstly, he would be benefiting the coffers of the State, which he obviously wants to do, and secondly, he would be making reparation in respect of what I consider was a very unwise and unfair thing to have done considering all the circumstances of the Information scandal.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-foreign-affairs">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened attentively to the hon. Senator. Once we have laid down for the board as a norm that it should dispose of State assets in a way that is least prejudicial to the interests of the State, that is a basic objective and norm for the board to work on. I cannot give the board retroactive powers. That is impossible.</p>

<p>You mean you cannot &#x2026;?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I cannot give the board functions with retroactive effect. The board has still to be established. Apart from the fact that I think it is a bad principle, I do not necessarily agree with the factual exposition of the hon. Senator. He said that according to what he had heard, according to newspaper reports, a certain newspaper group was prepared to pay more for <i>The Citizen</i> project than Perskor in fact paid. I have some knowledge of that situation. I am sorry that the hon. Senator found it necessary to introduce this subject into the discussion of clause 4. In that particular case, as far as I remember&#x2014;and I am not basing my knowledge on newspaper reports but on direct knowledge as a result of discussions with my colleagues in the Cabinet&#x2014;the basic objective was to save the taxpayer as much money as possible. As far as I can recollect, the Government in fact wanted to be relieved of contractual obligations and indemnified from possible claims which could have amounted to many millions of rands. It was a complicated matter requiring urgent action. It was thoroughly investigated by officials. It was not simply a political governmental decision. We had at the time, the assistance of the Pretorius Committee. Mr. Pretorius was a former Secretary to the Treasury. So it was not as if the Government had suddenly decided to get rid of a hot potato and in so doing, to show favour to a particular Press group in this country. The norm that we wanted to uphold was to save the taxpayer money, and the most money, and it was against that background that the decision was made. Recommendations were made by public servants who are known for their integrity and who have served the country and the State well for many decades. It was on the basis of their recommendations and in the light of the reports submitted by them in regard to various alternatives that the Government opted for that one particular decision. The sole criterion was how to save the taxpayer the most money; That was the sole reason.</p>
<p>I have listened attentively to the hon. Senator and to give him a short reply&#x2014;I regrettably cannot accept his suggestion.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply most interesting and fascinating, and I am not going to quarrel with the content of that reply except to say to him that he is as well aware as I am of the atmosphere created by the sale of <i>The Citizen</i> to the Perskor group.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, but in support of the argument advanced by the hon. Senator Crook in regard to retrospectivity of what I said in the Second Reading, I want to say this to the hon. the Minister. He is aware of the atmosphere that was created by the sale of <i>The Citizen</i> to Perskor. I am not going to quarrel with any of the things he said about the investigation that took place or in regard to the quality of the people who did the investigation. I accept that the hon. the Minister says all that and I accept what he says. Would he then not accept the view that it would be wise for the State to make this type of information available which would loll this whole thing stone dead? It would kill the unpleasantness or the doubts that exist in people&#x2019;s minds.</p>

I understood the hon. the Minister to say that the board has still to be established and that therefore he cannot do so. Well, for the life of me I cannot understand &#x2026;</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-foreign-affairs">

</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>No. I am merely giving one of the reasons the hon. the Minister gave. Are we to debate this or are we not? I am trying to debate this under great difficulty. The hon. the Minister gave that as a reason. In my submission, Sir, that is no reason at all. I might be wrong and the hon. the Minister might be right. But I cannot see what the board&#x2019;s not as yet having been established has to do with the matter whatsoever. This Parliament can make whatever laws it likes, Sir, and it could make this matter retrospective. If it was made retrospective it would, in our submission, do a great deal of good to this country. That was all that I said. There has been criticism, not only from the English-language Press, considerable criticism, but also from the Afrikaans-language Press arising out of this sale, and all I asked the hon. the Minister was whether he was not prepared to make this provision retrospective. He has indicated that he is not prepared to do so and that is something that I suggest is unwise on his part My own feeling is that if he were to do so, he would be doing the Government a tremendous amount of good because it would indicate clearly at least to the English-speaking people in this country that the Government was not doing this with the intention of having a newspaper that supported the NP in the English language so as to prevail upon English-speaking people to support the NP.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened to what the hon. Senator had to say. He reminded me of that famous bird which flew backwards, not to see where it was going but to find out where it had been. What the hon. Senator is suggesting, is an absurdity. If we were to make it retrospective would it not mean that there would have to be some legal action to declare the sale of <i>The Citizen</i> illegal? The function of this Trust Board is not to legalize acts that have already taken place illegally but to investigate existing businesses and to liquidate them. What the hon. member suggests will bring about a whole new process which is not the function of this Bill. We will be going backwards like that famous bird and draw in all sorts of unpleasantness. This will not be in harmony with the tone of the debate up till now. It is not the function of the Trust Board to declare the sale of <i>The Citizen</i> illegal or a non-event retrospectively. If it has to be declared a non-event, how is that going to be done? One can land up in the Supreme Court with actions for damages brought against one and there can be all sorts of other eventualities. I do not think that what the hon. Senator Crook is suggesting is wise from a legal point of view. I do not think that what he suggests can be enforced. I think he is entirely off the beam in this respect.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-foreign-affairs">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, may I just explain once more. I want to make one thing clear. If the hon. Senator supports the principle that a number of actions must be undone retroactively, he must ask for a Bill to deal with that principle. He must then endeavour to obtain support for such a Bill and debate it here. As far as the present measure is concerned, he, not I, referred to the clause as it has been amended. He quoted it, although he did so out of context the first time. I corrected him and afterwards he accepted my version. The amendment is to the effect that the following proviso be added to clause 4, viz.: &#x201C;Provided that wherever practical the board, at its discretion, shall observe the regulations of the Treasury and the Tender Board in the disposal of rights and assets of the State.&#x201D; It is, therefore, the board that has to observe at its discretion Treasury and Tender Board regulations. How then can this board accept Tender Board regulations retroactively? How does one do it? That is why I said that from a purely logical and legal point of view the amendment suggested by the hon. Senator cannot be accepted. I went further and explained my attitude on the merits and the facts of the matter. I have again listened to what the Senator had to say, but unfortunately I cannot accept his suggestion.</p>

<p>Yes, why don&#x2019;t I leave? They would wish me to leave, Mr. Chairman, so that they can have their own way.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I did not rise to cause any sort of row whatsoever, but to speak in all sincerity with the hon. the Minister who is, it appears, a person who is prepared to listen and not, like some Senators who may feel free to leave.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, we are dealing here with a provision of the Bill which provides that the object of the board will be to dispose of the rights and assets which will be transferred to it. You will allow me to refer to clause 6, Sir, which provides that the rights and assets shall be transferred to the board. It would appear from my reading of clause 6 that the rights and assets and liabilities of the State that are transferred to the board are those which will obtain at the date on which this Bill becomes law. That will be the date on which the State President assents to this Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-foreign-affairs">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>And such rights as may still be discovered.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Correct, and such rights as may be discovered in the future. But a question arises, Sir, and that is whether the objects of the board should not also include an investigation into past transactions which have been concluded&#x2014;the hon. Senator Crook mentioned one of them and the hon. the Minister knows that there are many more&#x2014;in which the State suffered loss, with a view to the possible recovery of some of the loss which the State suffered. The hon. Senator Crook mentioned one example only, and I do not think it is necessary for me to go into detail regarding the example. I think we must ask the hon. the Minister for clarity on that particular point. He agrees with me that clause 4 provides that the object of the board shall be to dispose of the rights and assets and fulfil the obligations which shall obtain on the date on which this Bill becomes law. He has further accepted the fact that any such rights and assets which may come to light in the future will also be within the scope of the objectives of the board and that the board can deal with them. But the question remains as to any rights and assets which the State may have&#x2014;I say &#x201C;may have&#x201D; advisedly&#x2014;in respect of transactions which have been concluded and whether or not those are also covered by the board.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-foreign-affairs">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the answer is to be found in the definition of &#x201C;application&#x201D; in clause 1, and I shall read it&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x201C;application&#x201D;, in relation to secret State funds, means the lending out or making available by the former department of such funds to any individual, organization, company or other body of persons, whether directly or through the agency of another individual, organization, company or other body of persons; &#x2026; and that is coupled to the concept of &#x201C;secret State funds&#x201D; which is now defined as&#x2014; all money, except any money appropriated for the former department by any appropriation Act, applied for any project initiated by the former department, any interest and any other income which at any time accrued or accrues to any person by virtue of the application of money received by him from the former department.</block>
<p>Those two concepts are found again in clause 6, to which the hon. Senator referred.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">

<p>From where was the hon. the Minister quoting a moment ago?</p>

<p>The definition of &#x201C;secret State funds&#x201D;, as amended. I also quoted the definition of &#x201C;application&#x201D; in clause 1. Those are the two concepts we have defined, viz. &#x201C;secret State funds&#x201D; and &#x201C;application&#x201D;. You will find the same phraseology used in clause 6 of this measure.</p>
<p>I cannot take it any further. I want to establish a board that can act effectively and efficiently and clean up, wind up, and recover for the State what belongs to the State in the shortest possible time. Should there be any need for claims or investigations of the nature mentioned by the hon. Senator, that is a different matter as far as I am concerned. We now need a mechanism, Mr. Chairman, and unless we establish it soon the State may lose a lot of money. That is all I can say.</p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause, as amended, agreed to.</p>
</speech>
<p>Clause 6:</p>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 6 deals with the rights, duties and powers of the board. I shall read the first portion of the clause to indicate what those are&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">All rights, assets and liabilities of the State created by or arising from any agreement entered into, or purporting to have been entered into, by or on behalf of the former Department, or which arise from the application of secret State funds, are hereby transferred to the board.</block>
<p>It is clear, for instance, that the loan of over R800 000 to one Pieterse in connection with a company that he controlled the object of which was to make cinematograph films, will be affected. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether there is any possibility, as far as he is aware, of recovering the enormous sum of over R800 000 from Pieterse. We have of necessity very little knowledge of what has gone on. The only knowledge we have has been obtained from the Press.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech that it was intended to recover moneys not only from persons and companies and the like in this country, moneys which in terms of the Bill it was apparently intended to recover, but also to recover moneys from overseas. That is what I heard the hon. the Minister say. I trust that this falls within the Bill.

As far as I am concerned the only means by which an action can be commenced against McGoff, for instance, to recover moneys that he has evidently received, will be by founding jurisdiction according to law. According to law jurisdiction can only be founded against McGoff if an attachment of his property is made in this country. [Interjections.] Then I would like the hon. the Minister to refer me to any authority at all where the courts of South Africa&#x2014;the courts of the Transvaal, the Supreme Court of the Transvaal or the magistrates&#x2019; courts there&#x2014;can issue summons and bring before the courts of South Africa one McGoff who lives in the United States. One cannot do it.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-foreign-affairs">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>There are ways and means that could be employed to try to recover money from Mr. McGoff. I do not say we would be successful, but we could try to do so in the United States. A case could be made there if we had sufficient evidence. There may be other ways and means to try to recover money.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Cannot you reply to me in terms of the rules? When I am finished my argument perhaps the hon. the Minister could then reply.</p>
<p>What I want to know from the hon. the Minister is whether it is not possible to found jurisdiction by attaching McGoff&#x2019;s property, if he has any property in this country, and then proceeding in the courts of South Africa against him in order to recover in whole or in part the amount which he has been found to be liable to this country for, and then by such attachment to satisfy the judgment in whole or in part. That is what I want to ask the hon. the Minister. In my submission it is a perfectly valid question, you will agree with me, Sir. I should like the hon. the Minister to reply to me, not while I am standing on my feet but when I sit down. [Interjections.] I understand too that there are moneys &#x2026; This debate is being conducted in the most extraordinary manner. I came here to get information.

<p>Clause 12 (contd.):</p>
<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, before the debate on this particular clause was adjourned, I had indicated the objection of this side of the House to the withdrawal of the war risk clause from any life policy at all. In discussions the hon. the Minister has indicated that this was perhaps not altogether fair on the particular companies who had entered into the group life cover on the basis that they could change the conditions of the policy at any time. Nonetheless, I think it is incumbent upon us to ensure that people who are doing their national service and guarding our country and our future should be covered and that they should know that they are covered. Therefore, I move the following amendments standing in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">(1) On page 16, in line 1, to omit &#x201C;Sections 38 and 38A shall not apply to&#x201D; and to substitute:<br/>Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 38 and 38A, an insurer who has issued<br/>(2) on page 16, after line 6, to add:<br/>may require an increased premium to cover any war risk on the life of any member of the group.</block>
<p>The purport of these amendments is to ensure that the war risk cover remains, but it does give the company holding the group life cover the option of increasing the premium to cover any particular extra risk which it has not bargained for. I feel that this adequately safeguards the interests of both the company and the insured person. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept the amendments.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I have given careful consideration to these amendments and I am afraid I have some difficulties with them. I wish to say immediately that there is of course no question that there are types of cover available to ex-servicemen now and that many of them are in fact covered in some way or other. As I explained previously, we are not satisfied with the overall position. That is why the Registrar of Insurance has taken the initiative for some time now, in consultation with the Department of Defence and the insurance industry, to thrash out what we believe will be a very satisfactory insurance policy. They have made very good progress and we shall be in a position to announce this scheme quite soon. There is, therefore, no question about the importance of this matter to this side of the House.</p>
<p>As far as group policies are concerned, when we last discussed this a few days ago, I explained our difficulty. If there is a contract between an insured and an insurer in which it is stipulated that that policy can be amended or even cancelled, then it is not for the State <i>ex post facto</i> to interfere and to try to upset that contract. That would be completely wrong. That is one of the main difficulties we have in trying to change this.</p>
<p>Coming to the amendments of the hon. Senator Bozas, it seems to me that what he has in mind is that sections 38 and 38A will apply to group policies except that the premium can be increased in respect of the war clause, as we call it. As I say, I have difficulties here. Apart from the necessity to alter premiums, to exclude group policies from sections 38 and 38A, my difficulties are really twofold. Firstly, section 38(5) provides that an insurer, who relies on the provisions of section 38(3) and in doing so does not meet a claim in respect of the war risk which may be excluded, namely, service outside the Republic or anywhere in an aircraft, shall refund the premiums paid to the member concerned. This treatment is obviously not possible in respect of group life policies where no reserves are accumulated out of the very nature of the policy unlike the case of normal life insurance policies. Secondly, section 38A contains in effect a similar provision in subsection (1) which compels insurers to pay out in cases where the military risk is excluded an amount at least equal to premiums paid. This provision also militates against the concept of group life policies where no reserves are accumulated and therefore cannot be given effect to.</p>
<p>I am quite sure that we do not differ in our approach, but the hon. Senator&#x2019;s amendments are impractical because in fact they give a quality to these policies which does not exist. It means therefore that the insurance company itself is not in a position to make these financial provisions.</p>
<p>Having taken full account of this interesting discussion my approach is that we should approve of the position as it is now being proposed and let us put this new policy into operation as soon as possible, which is our whole objective. I hope the hon. Senator will agree with me when I say that the proposed insurance policy while including certain qualities of group policies, will go further and will meet the requirements extremely well. I am sorry that I have these practical difficulties with the amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the difficulties of the hon. the Minister but I come back to the position of the young man who has started work and has become interested in a group life policy. Because he has not been told otherwise, he is under the impression that his life is covered and so he does not take other precautions to cover his life. This is not only theory because I know what happens in practice. I wonder how many hon. Senators in this Chamber have read in detail the contract provisions of their life policies. I would say not even 20%, and this is the problem. The agent comes along and says: This is a group life policy which the company has negotiated. For this and that premium you can have your life covered. The person then just signs. He is totally unaware that the war risk clause can be excluded. He is totally unaware that the policy can be cancelled. During the Second Reading debate I said that some of these people are taken for king-size rides. I say this advisedly. Mr. Chairman, I feel if any company is going to opt out of the war risk clause, then they must give due and timeous notice to the person concerned. If the hon. the Minister is unable to accept the amendment&#x2014; he has indicated that he has difficulties and I appreciate them&#x2014;and the clause is going to go through as it is in the Bill, I ask him to ensure that the registrar issues instructions one way or another to all companies that if they are going to evade the war risk, they will have to give notice to that effect in writing by registered post to the particular person whose life is insured. At least then those people will know that their lives are not covered against war risk and will have to take appropriate action.</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I must add my voice to the plea to the hon. the Minister to consider this amendment put by the hon. Senator Bozas. The hon. the Minister conceded when we last debated this matter that the whole intention of the amendment to section 38 and the insertion of section 38A, was to provide for the protection of servicemen, of persons doing military service in the service of their country. I put it to the hon. the Minister that last year when we amended section 38, we did in fact interfere with the contractual relationship between an insurer and a person who had taken out insurance when we provided that there should be no increase in premium and that there should be no deletion of the war clause. But there was at that stage an interference in what was an existing contractual relationship in many cases.</p>
<p>I submit that what we are asking now is simply that that principle should be extended again. Let us look at the particular nature of the insurance policies we are considering. These are policies known as group life policies which are issued by certain firms to certain groups of persons who are connected in one way or another, generally through employment. Because of the advantage which the company has of being able to sell its policy to a large group of people and because of administrative savings, the insurer allows it at a lower premium. I do not believe that there is any other benefit which pertains to the persons who are insured, other than a financial one; it is a pecuniary benefit they derive in the form of lower premiums. That point was made very clearly by the hon. the Minister the other day, and let me say right away that we accept this. Therefore, the second part of the amendment moved by the hon. Senator Bozas to allow the insurer to put himself in a position where he should be compensated for the additional cover which he is now asked to take, means that there is in fact an interference in the contract which has been struck between the insurer and the insured.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>No, not by the Government. What I said was that the amendment moved by the hon. Senator Bozas will in fact entail an interference in that contract between the insurer and the insured. We accept that; that is what we intend. But we believe that as long as you compensate the person whose interests are affected by the interference, that interference will be justified. Secondly, we believe that this interference is justified by the exceptional circumstances with which we are dealing, and those are the circumstances where a young person is in the service of his country, defending his country, in time of war.</p>
<p>Under those circumstances, Sir, I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister. If he has not had time to consider this amendment fully we will accept that situation and we will not press it now. But perhaps he will at least give us an undertaking that he will have another look at it, that he will ask his advisers to have a look at it in the light of the fact that while we are interfering with a contractual relationship in the amendment we are allowing the person whose interests are prejudiced to compensate or recompense himself for that prejudice by increasing the premiums. I ask the hon. the Minister to look at it again before he takes this Bill to the Other Place.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to meet the hon. Opposition on a matter like this because there is no difference in our approach. I can however assure the hon. Senator Bozas and the hon. Senator Webber that I do have serious practical difficulties. We have given considerable attention to this question from the moment we first saw the amendment. I have been in personal touch with the registrar and his office and they also looked at it very thoroughly this morning. I have since talked to them again. I would like to direct the attention of the hon. Senator Webber to the amendment effected last year, i.e. the insertion of section 38A. That did not, of course, interfere with any signed contract between an insurer and an insured. It would be wrong on the part of the Government unilaterally, after the event, to change a long-term insurance policy between an insured and an insurer by passing legislation subsequently to provide that a clause in that policy had to be changed.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? As I understood the amendment last year to section 38&#x2014;not section 38A; section 38A was a new section that was inserted&#x2014;it precluded an insurer from enforcing the no military service provision in an insurance policy contracted before 30 June 1978.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>That was section 38 but section 38A gave the insurer the discretion, from that date onwards, to decide whether or not he would include the war risk clause. Some include it and some do not. What we are aiming at in the insurance policy that is now being fashioned is, in fact, to provide what will be compulsory insurance for these people on favourable terms. That is the whole object.</p>
<p>I am quite prepared to look at this again, Mr. Chairman. I am prepared to talk once again to my advisers, as the hon. Senator Webber calls them, and if I can find any way of amending this in the spirit of this proposal without arbitrarily trying to upset what is in fact a contract between the insurer and the insured, I will do it. I cannot give an absolute assurance but I will certainly look at it again and if that is possible in the light of further consideration, I will move the amendment in the Other Place. But that is as far as I can possibly go.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me say right at the outset that I do not expect a reply from the hon. the Minister, but I rise merely to place on record our attitude towards this particular clause. This is something which we welcome as a tremendous step forward; it is in line with other changes that have been brought about in Government thinking. We have the situation now for the first time where a Black member of a pension fund may obtain loans from that pension fund in order to provide a home for his family. Sir, we welcome this; we believe this is a step in the right direction and we hope that we will see a lot more of this type of legislation for which, I may add, we have been asking for a long time.</p>
<p>Clause agreed to.</p>
</speech>
<p>Clause 30:</p>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause which amends section 18 of the Banks Act could almost be called a barometer of the economic climate of the country. I see the hon. the Minister nods. I assume that he has taken my point there. The hon. the Minister has the power either to stimulate the economy or, if it is running too hot, to cool it down, and this is the clause that he uses either by adding money into the economy or by taking it out.</p>
<p>I do not believe that it is necessary right now for the hon. the Minister to increase this amount and, in actual fact, he has decreased it. There is in fact a surfeit of money in the Government coffers if we are to believe what we are told, but what is needed at the moment is encouragement to the private sector to get on with the business of developing the country. For that to happen it must have finance available. Finance must be available for development and that is precisely what the hon. the Minister intends with this amendment to subsection (1) of section 18.</p>
<p>The new subsection (2) to section 18 of Act 23 of 1965 proposes that&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Minister may from time to time by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> alter the percentages mentioned in subsection (1).</block>
<p>I put it to the hon. the Minister that he has a responsibility to Parliament and Parliament has a responsibility to the banks and to the public of South Africa. Therefore I feel that we can justify the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s asking for this power to alter the percentages because of the system that we have in this country where Parliament disbands for six or seven months in the year and the executive is left to run the country. He is not unreasonable in asking for the power the alter this rate at any time. I believe, however, that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s power to do so should also be subject to the control of Parliament because, as I say, he has a responsibility to Parliament. We feel therefore that he should not have an unfettered power to increase the prescribed amount that banking institutions shall maintain in prescribed investments. We believe that he should be limited to the maximum amount which he has applied up to date, and that is the figure of 15% which stands in the Act at the moment.</p>
<p>We believe further that when the hon. the Minister exercises this discretionary power he should report to Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity. In this regard I submit that his reporting to Parliament is one thing but the opportunity of Parliament to debate the use of that discretionary power is another matter. It is for that reason that I wish to move amendment No (2) which stands in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On page 22, after line 56, to add:<br/>(3) Any alteration made under the provisions of subsection (2) before the date upon which Parliament meets for the first time for the dispatch of business in any session during which the Minister introduces the Appropriation Bill shall, unless Parliament otherwise provides, lapse thirty days after the end of the session during which the Minister introduced such Bill, but without detracting from the validity of such alteration before it has so lapsed.</block>
<p>This will sound very familiar to the hon. the Minister and in fact it is taken from the Sales Tax Act.</p>

<p>That is where it comes from. I bow to the hon. the Minister. I acknowledge his parenthood. The thought originated with him and I simply picked it up.</p>
<p>I believe that he should have introduced that particular thought into this measure as well because I believe it is as valid in this case as it is in the case of the Sales Tax Act where he has a discretion to increase or to reduce the rate of that tax.</p>
<p>Before my time runs out I would also move, coming back to the first part of my argument, amendment No. (1) which stands in my name on the Order Paper and which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On page 22, in line 56, after &#x201C;(1)&#x201D; to add:<br/>Provided that the amount of prescribed investments which a banking institution shall be required to maintain in the Republic shall not exceed an amount of fifteen per cent of its long-term liabilities to the public in the Republic: Provided further that the amount of prescribed investments consisting of securities issued by the Government of the Republic and which rank as a prescribed investment shall not exceed eight and a half per cent of the said long-term investments</block>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I would not like to say that the amendments moved by the hon. Senator Webber are unreasonable. I do not say so at all. I think the hon. Senator Webber has put his case perfectly reasonably, if I may say that too. Of course, the last thing that one wants to do here is to by-pass Parliament. That is not in my mind here at all. In the light of experience over many years, we want to see how we can devise these things so that they operate reasonably smoothly and with a certain flexibility that we have found to be extremely valuable. It is interesting that for instance the International Monetary Fund from time to time sends out missions to member countries to look at the economy. The IMF reserves the right to put out reports and recommendations to the governments of member countries from time to time, and that is what they have done to us. In last year&#x2019;s report, which in our opinion was an extremely valuable report, the International Monetary Fund in fact commented on the very little discretion a Minister of Finance has in South Africa to alter any financial ratios, taxes or whatever. They actually recommended that we should do something about it, even to the extent of giving the Minister of Finance powers to alter certain taxes. I was not prepared to accept that recommendation. Taxes, after all, are obligatory imposts imposed by Parliament on the population, and in my view one has to be very careful not to put the power to change those taxes too easily into a Minister&#x2019;s hands. All we did in that regard was to take the power to enable the Minister of Finance to alter loan levies between sessions of Parliament because that is not strictly a tax. A loan levy is really a loan which has to be repaid within a certain period at interest. It is true that it is a compulsory loan, but it is not a tax in the sense of a compulsory impost that one never sees again. I merely mention that because it is part of the philosophy.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the hon. Senator is quite right, this is an important issue because, after all, what would happen if a government were going to run wild and simply say to a pension fund or to insurers or banks: &#x201C;You have been making available so much of your investments to the Government in this way through prescribed investments, for instance 15%, but from tomorrow it will be 20%&#x201D;. That could cause havoc. But, obviously, that is the last thing we wish to do. All we are trying to do here is to introduce a certain measure of flexibility so that the Minister can, when changing conditions make it important to do so, take some of these steps quickly.</p>
<p>In the case of insurers and pension funds I have not tried to take these powers, the reason being that there we have an advisory committee that concentrates on long-term business which, of course, is the business that accumulates these huge funds, and the advisory committee has not made any move to advise me to do this. Until the advisory committee feels that in the case of insurance and pension funds, which are the very big ones, these steps should be taken, I am reluctant to raise the matter and that is why I have left well alone.</p>
<p>But the banks are in a rather different category and the registrar informs me that the banks have no objection to this. We have kept these ratios rather low and we want to continue to keep them low. In fact, we shall be confirming the reduction of last year if this Bill is passed and, obviously, unless conditions become extremely tight financially, I would certainly not wish to raise these percentages. In fact, it can only be to our advantage to reduce these ratios because it gives a bit more stimulation to the economy and it certainly means that one is leaving more money in the hands of the private sector, which is what I am very keen to do.</p>
<p>So I do not think there is any danger that we can go the wrong way in this respect, but all of us in the financial authority&#x2014;as we call it&#x2014;in Government feel that the time has arrived that where the banks are not concerned about this we should take the further discretion to be more flexible. The Minister should be given more flexibility and it is in that sense that we are doing this. I must say that we regard this as being of some importance in the general formulation of financial policy. It is certainly not an attempt on my part in any way to steer this outside Parliament. In fact there are many opportunities in Parliament in budget debates and on other occasions to raise a matter of this kind if there is any unease about it. I hope the hon. Senator will see it in that light. Without the trade or the industry itself approaching me, I certainly do not wish to interfere with the current position of the big savers, viz. the insurers and the pension funds, and that is why I have left them severely alone.</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. the Minister for that clear and concise explanation of the attitude of the Government. Whilst we feel that these amendments are essential we are not going to press the issue, but I think a word of warning would be timely right now to the hon. the Minister. I am going to cite a particular case and I cannot recollect whether he was in fact the Minister of Finance at the time. There is, therefore, no question of a personal blame being attached.</p>
<p>From what he said just now, the hon. the Minister will appreciate the untold harm that can be done to the economy, to business and to business confidence within the Republic by the injudicious use of this power. I want to quote the example of Marshall Industrials, a firm which was large in Natal. The hon. the Minister will have a personal knowledge of this firm. This firm went into liquidation through liquidity problems which were created by the banks calling in certain overdraft facilities because the banks had been forced to do so by higher authority through the Reserve Bank, starting with the Minister of Finance. In that case we had the situation where 22 000 people were suddenly thrown out of employment. But the situation today is such that not only are all the shareholders going to get their money back but they are also going to get a dividend. There was nothing wrong with the company at all except for the one question of liquidity. Its liquidity problem was caused directly by action through the banks. That is the sort of example I just want to draw to the attention of the hon. the Minister and to say to him that a heavy responsibility rests on him. In the past it was on Parliament, but that responsibility now rests on him. I know that the country will be looking to him to exercise that responsibility judiciously.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I take the point but in fairness I would say that that situation in respect of Marshall Industrials did not arise as a result of prescribed investments. I would like to draw the hon. Senator Webber&#x2019;s attention to the fact that a similar kind of provision and approach, a very important one, exists in the case of the Reserve Bank in determining the liquid asset requirements of banks. That is not put before Parliament and the reason is that it is regarded as a highly technical financial matter in respect of which I think probably the whole financial world would feel the Reserve Bank is acting with absolute discretion and responsibility. I hope very much that the hon. Senator will agree that if it can be continued on this limited basis just for the banks, we can do so with equal responsibility on that score. I am glad the hon. Senator feels that he does not have to press this, but I wish to repeat that I certainly take the point the hon. Senator raised.</p>

<p>Yes. I wish to pose the following question to the hon. the Minister. Does the hon. the Minister believe that the principle that building societies should in fact become developers of land is a good one? I have no firm convictions in this regard except that the thought comes to mind that if building societies do become large-scale developers there will be less funds available for the normal borrower, viz. the private householder who wishes to build or buy. Building societies could justifiably say to them that they had used all their available funds for developing their own schemes. This thought worries me quite considerably and I would like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s opinion on it.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very glad the hon. Senator raised that, because that is not the intention. Many building societies, as the hon. Senator knows, have their own property development companies. Provision for this is made in clause 32(b). This clause seeks to provide for special cases, viz. when a building society finds that there are arrears on loans affecting vacant land and that it has to buy back that land. The question then arises as to what to do with that vacant land. Many building societies have difficulties in disposing of these rather useless assets. Representations have been made for some time that in those cases where they are obliged to repossess land and they are not able to sell it, they should be allowed to build on it so that the opportunity of selling it will be so much better. It is in those restricted cases that we thought we ought to give in to their representations.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President I rise to raise a small matter with the hon. the Minister, a matter that I have in fact discussed with him from time to time. My purpose in raising the matter now is to have it placed on record so that people who do read Hansard can at least have a look at some of the things we might say about it and form their own opinion.</p>
<p>The matter refers to the special riot insurance cover which was agreed to earlier in the session. I should like to bring the difficulties that have been experienced in regard to the rating scale of this particular type of insurance publicly to the notice of the hon. the Minister. I have already done so privately. There is a special association handling this insurance, and it is composed mainly of insurance people from whom the hon. the Minister takes his advice. In raising the subject I intend no criticism of the hon. the Minister or the officials dealing with this matter.</p>
<p>The difficulty first arose when this association put out a list of rates and, in doing so, it unfortunately included a racial connotation. It talked about different rates for different areas, and specifically made it clear that there were special rates for African areas, Coloured areas, Indian areas and White areas. This caused a great deal of concern, particularly among the Indian community of Durban. As the hon. the Minister knows, there are very many Indian businesses in Durban. I think they certainly outnumber the number of White businesses there. They felt that this was an unnecessary introduction of an unfortunate political aspect; in other words, insurance was to be rated on race rather than on risk which is what should have been the case.</p>
<p>This point has been argued among the insurance community for some time, but it now transpires that while, for argument&#x2019;s sake, a White rate will be a particular percentage, the rate for a similar risk in a Black area will be five times that of the White rate, and in an Indian area three times that of the White rate. It might well be said that risks in these particular areas are greater than they are in the White areas and one would not argue that from an underwriting point of view, but where the problem arose was in regard to what in fact constituted a White area and what constituted a non-White area. The association decided that the best way to do this would be to follow the Group Areas Act. It made the point that if an area was classified for a particular group area in terms of the Group Areas Act, that would be the classification they would apply.</p>
<p>They have now issued a list which they say they have obtained from the Government setting out the various proclaimed group areas for rating purposes. As far as Natal is concerned, for the information of the hon. the Minister I should like to point out that they say Grey Street is an Indian group area. Now, the hon. the Minister will not mind if I quote from the letter he wrote to me. This was information given to him. He pointed out that an Indian property located in a White area would carry the White rate and, conversely, a White property located in an Indian area would carry the Indian rate. In his letter he stated specifically that Grey Street would carry the White rate. Of course, Mr. President, this is completely contrary to the information now passed on to all the insurance companies which puts Grey Street in an Indian area.</p>
<p>I want the hon. the Minister to appreciate that I am not quarrelling with him in any way in this matter. What I am trying to convey to him is that there is a good deal of confusion in regard to the rating of this type of insurance. I think it should be cleared up one way or the other. I am very happy with the letter the hon. the Minister wrote me. I hope that that is the way in which it will be done and I think this is the way in which it should in fact be done. One cannot just take a proclaimed group area and say that it will be subject to a certain rate because, when one looks at the list, one sees too that Kloof, Natal, is stated to be an Indian area. Well, it could be Indian and it could be White; Kloof is divided into different parts. Westville, for instance, has an Indian area and a White area. Obviously the instructions are most misleading and I think that this matter must be cleared up fairly rapidly.</p>
<p>There is another problem connected with this, Sir, and I have personal experience of it. If one rates this insurance incorrectly, one cannot cancel the coupon. The companies say that they cannot cancel the coupon, and the premium has to accompany the coupon itself. Many instances of incorrect rating are in fact taking place and all I can say to the hon. the Minister is that I do hope he can have this matter cleared up as quickly as possible because daily this type of insurance is being written and underwritten and in many cases there must be dozens of mistakes made almost daily, which are, in fact, very difficult to correct later.</p>
<p>As long as I have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that he will go further into this matter, I shall be content to leave it at that.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I think we have come to the end of what has been a very important debate during which we have discussed the various financial institutions. Although the title of the Bill seems innocuous, Financial Institutions Amendment Bill, I think the hon. the Minister will agree that it is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation he brings before Parliament annually.</p>
<p>We had our say during the Second Reading and during the Committee Stage and I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that we appreciate the fact that he has seen the point of view of this side of the House and he appreciates the problems we have put forward. I would welcome his further attention, as he has promised, particularly to the proposed amendments, to see whether something cannot in fact be done or some amendment moved in the Other Place to protect the war risk cover of those young people serving their country.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I should like to express my appreciation to the hon. Opposition for their positive attitude in regard to this measure. I agree with the hon. Senator Bozas that this is really an important measure; it contains amendments to at least five very important Acts, and I also regard it as a very important piece of legislation. I must say that it is very helpful to this side of the House, and therefore the Government if the Opposition adopts such a positive and constructive attitude, and I shall give careful consideration to the opinions that have been expressed here. In the one specific case, if it appears possible to do anything about it when we have reconsidered it, I shall raise it in the Other Place.</p>
<p>†As far as the hon. Senator Winchester is concerned, he has raised what is an important point affecting a new kind of insurance in our experience, i.e. riot cover, and the question of the rating as it affects different areas and different types of property. I shall certainly have that matter investigated very carefully. This association or new company is still very new and there is no doubt that in some respects they are still feeling their way. However, I fully agree with the hon. Senator that if there are anomalies which can be cleared up immediately then the sooner that is done the better. I shall have that investigated immediately, Mr. President, and I shall keep the hon. Senator informed.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>There is another reason for this, Mr. President. I think you will agree, Sir, and I think the hon. House will agree, that there have been some almost earth-shattering events recently. One only has to look at the oil developments lately to realize the implications this could have for our economy and policy. I hope the House will bear with me when I try to give some idea of how we see these matters.</p>
<p>Since I introduced my budget in March this year there have been a number of new developments in the world economy as such which have important implications for South Africa and, of course, for our fiscal, monetary and other economic policies.</p>
<p>Some of these developments have been unfavourable from our point of view and some favourable. The most important of the unfavourable has been the substantial further increase in world oil prices, particularly on the free market. This increase, which has been accompanied in many countries by actual shortages of liquid fuels, has upset the world economic applecart and sent government economists in most countries back to the drawing boards. The truth is that world economic conditions and prospects have been materially altered by the latest energy crisis, and for most non-oil producing countries this has not been a change for the better.</p>
<p>The impact of the new oil situation on the world economy will be inflationary in one sense and deflationary in another. It will be inflationary in the sense that it is bound to exert a marked upward influence on costs and prices in virtually all countries. And it will be deflationary in the sense that it is likely to retard the growth of total real spending by business enterprises and consumers on other goods and services. For this reason it might well serve to slow down and shorten the current moderate cyclical economic upswing in the major industrial countries and to deepen the next recession. The change in the oil situation can therefore be said to have raised the spectre of what is sometimes called &#x201C;stagflation&#x201D; in the world once again.</p>
<p>As an important trading nation, South Africa is bound to be adversely affected by both these inflationary and deflationary influences as and when they materialize. The inflationary effects will be felt almost immediately. It is therefore only realistic to expect that the rate of inflation in South Africa in the months ahead will in all likelihood be higher that it would otherwise have been. As Minister of Finance, I am deeply concerned about this prospect. Inflation is an evil which does incalculable harm to the economy and which, as businessmen have increasingly discovered in recent years, does not even have the redeeming feature of being conducive to long run economic growth. With due regard to its other main economic objectives, the Government will therefore redouble its efforts to curb inflation and to mitigate its adverse effects wherever possible. I shall return to this point later.</p>
<p>The deflationary effects of the oil price increase will probably be felt by both the world as a whole and South Africa at a somewhat later stage. In the opinion of many experts, the United States is likely to move into a recessionary phase within the next six or twelve months, and in due course the present cyclical upswing in Western Europe should also peter out and be followed by the next downward phase. South Africa, of course, also has a business cycle, and it is well known that this cycle normally lags behind that of Western Europe by up to one year or more. This well established pattern of behaviour, together with the fact that the South African economy is at present in the middle of an upswing which, although moderate, is still gathering momentum, would suggest that our next cyclical downswing is still some way off and that the prospects for the year ahead remain very good.</p>
<p>This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that certain other recent developments in the world economy have been extremely favourable from our point of view and have served to strengthen the South African economy in certain fundamental aspects. The basic fact is that the changed oil situation in the world has understandably been accompanied by a changed gold and international currency situation, which has resulted in sharp increases in the prices of gold and certain other &#x201C;store of value&#x201D; commodities such as platinum. Moreover, these increases have occurred not only in terms of United States dollars but in terms of all currencies, including the German mark, the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>What we have witnessed during recent months has, in fact, been a world wide depreciation of currencies against gold. This has not only greatly increased the value of South Africa&#x2019;s gold output but has also raised the value of our official gold reserves in terms of other currencies. Valued at the average market price of the last ten days of May minus 10%&#x2014;that is the official method of gold valuation used in South Africa during the past year&#x2014;the gold holdings of the Reserve Bank at the end of May 1979 amounted to nearly R2 billion, while the bank&#x2019;s gold and other foreign assets as a whole attained the record month-end figure of R2,6 billion.</p>
<p>South Africa is therefore in the fortunate position that, unlike many other non-oil-producing countries, it should not experience any significant deterioration in its balance of payments in 1979. On the contrary, despite the expected large increase in the oil import bill, our balance of payments should show another substantial surplus this year, both on current account and in the so-called &#x201C;basic balance&#x201D;, namely the current account plus long-term capital movements. In other words, what we lose on the swings we tend to gain on the roundabouts.</p>
<p>It is, of course, impossible to predict our future balance of payments behaviour with any accuracy in a world in which current payments surpluses and deficits are in the process of being reshuffled&#x2014;this is because the oil price increases are affecting some countries much more adversely than others. But the indications are that, in this &#x201C;reshuffling&#x201D;, South Africa, as a major producer of gold, platinum, diamonds and coal, should fare relatively well.</p>
<p>The recent behaviour of both the commercial rand and the financial rand clearly supports this conclusion. Since the institution of the new exchange rate system in South Africa towards the end of January this year, the commercial rand has shown an average effective appreciation against all other currencies of about 4%. During this same period the new financial rand has appreciated from about 64 United States cents to levels in excess of 90 cents during the past week, so that the discount on the financial rand has declined from about 46% to the vicinity of 20%. These movements clearly reflect increased foreign confidence and interest in the South African economy and a further strengthening of the underlying balance of payments position. To this must be added the fact that, after rising by R479 million during 1978, the net gold and other foreign reserves&#x2014;that will be the gross figure minus foreign liabilities&#x2014;increased by a further R313 million in the first quarter of 1979.</p>
<p>The recent gold developments, including the important monetary role assigned to gold in the new European Monetary System and the decision announced yesterday by the British Government to abolish controls on gold coins, provide further evidence of gold&#x2019;s underlying strength and continuing monetary significance. The views I expressed on this subject in Washington in 1975, after the announcement by the International Monetary Fund of the so-called new &#x201C;understanding&#x201D; on gold, as they called it, and which they said would finally demonetize gold out of the system, have now been completely vindicated.</p>
<p>As far as the price of gold is concerned, I wish to reiterate my view that it will in all probability continue to show large fluctuations but that in the long term it should remain on an upward trend. Our fiscal and monetary policies will, however, continue to be based on extremely conservative assumptions regarding the price of gold.</p>
<p>I turn now to the implications for our own fiscal and monetary policies of the recent world economic developments.</p>
<p>In any assessment of these implications, account must be taken not only of the various influences I have already mentioned, but also of the fact that the policy of financial discipline applied in South Africa during the past three years has resulted in an economic situation which is fundamentally sounder than that of 1975&#x2014;government spending, bank credit and the money supply as a whole are now under much better control and the current account of the balance of payments is showing a record surplus, whereas it showed a substantial deficit in 1975.</p>
<p>In these circumstances the Government has decided not to deviate from its basic economic and financial policy of &#x201C;growth from strength&#x201D; as announced in the Budget Speech in March this year. Obviously certain sectors of the economy will be adversely affected by the increased prices and reduced supplies of liquid fuels and related products. However, certain other sectors, such as mining, should derive substantial net benefits from the recent developments. The oil problem confronting South Africa is therefore basically one of restructuring production and re-allocating resources. There will have to be marked changes in the patterns and methods of production. It is only realistic to accept that these unavoidable adjustments will take time and may have certain disruptive effects in the short term. On balance, however, we should still be able to attain the desired acceleration of the rate of real economic growth, and our fiscal and monetary policies remain directed towards that objective.</p>
<p>This does not mean, of course, that our fiscal and monetary policies will remain completely unchanged in every detail. On the contrary, as and when necessary, these policies will be modified in order to encourage the required restructuring of production and, wherever possible, to attempt to alleviate hardships caused by changes in relative prices and in the distribution of real income.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that, in the changed circumstances, the amount and composition of State revenue in the current fiscal year are likely to differ materially from the original Budget estimates. It is probable, for example, that more revenue will be obtained from the mining sector than could have been anticipated, and less from certain other sectors. During the course of the fiscal year there are also bound to be adjustments to the amount and composition of State expenditure, which will be reflected in due course in the additional estimates. Although it is too early to give any firm indications in this regard, these changes might include adjustments to certain subsidies with a view to cushioning some of the adverse secondary effects of the higher oil price. Excessive use of subsidies will, however, have to be avoided. This is not only because of the normal Budget constraints and the need to retain financial discipline, but also because subsidies will hide the real costs of liquid fuels and thereby reduce the incentive to users of these fuels to make the necessary adjustments in the national interest. The latter consideration applies particularly in the case of any subsidies on liquid fuels as such. For these reasons it is desirable that liquid fuel prices should at all times be realistic and market related.</p>
<p>Apart from possible steps to alleviate some of the effects of a higher rate of inflation, the need to curb the inflation rate itself will remain a basic consideration in the formulation of official economic policy. To this end, the rates of increase of money supply and government expenditures will be kept at appropriate levels and a high priority will be given to avoiding any re-emergence of demand inflation.</p>
<p>As I have emphasized before, however, our present inflation is manifestly not demand inflation. Like the inflation in the world as a whole, it no doubt has its roots in earlier demand inflation caused by excessive money creation and spending. But at present our problem is not one of &#x201C;too much money chasing too few goods&#x201D;. It is a problem of excessive cost increases stemming from such factors as higher fuel prices, unavoidable increases in administered prices, and wage and salary increases in excess of productivity in certain sectors.</p>
<p>It would therefore clearly be counter-productive to deviate from our policy of encouraging more rapid economic growth and the creation of more employment opportunities by attempting, through new restrictive fiscal and monetary measures, to reduce real investment and consumption. Such measures are not called for from a balance of payments point of view and would have little, if any, restraining effect on the rate of inflation. But they would reduce the rate of growth, increase unemployment and diminish foreign and domestic confidence in the South African economy.</p>
<p>While keeping the changing economic and financial situation under constant review and making such policy adjustments as may become necessary, we shall therefore persist with our basic official strategy of &#x201C;growth from strength&#x201D;. This strategy has already yielded favourable results, and I remain confident that our present economic upswing will continue and that our rate of real economic growth will accelerate further during the period ahead.</p>
<p>*Hon. Senators will remember that in my budget speech in the Other Place and on numerous other occasions I emphasized the importance of the work that was being done by the Priorities Committee in order to bring about a more orderly and controlled programme of spending by the public sector of South Africa.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Committee for Economic Policy decided on 19 August 1976 to establish an inter-departmental committee to inquire into and to make recommendations concerning the priorities that have to be followed in capital spending programmes for State Corporations and institutions, the S.A. Railways and Harbours and the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. The following persons were requested to serve on the committee&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Chairman&#x2014;the Secretary for Finance,<br/>Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister,<br/>General Manager of the South African Railways and Harbours,<br/>Postmaster-General,<br/>Secretary for Mines,<br/>Secretary for Industries.</block>
<p>Subsequently the Secretary to the Treasury was co-opted as a permanent member in view of the fact that the committee felt that, in order to make meaningful recommendations concerning the priorities in regard to capital projects by State Corporations and State institutions, it should also have regard to the major capital programmes of State departments themselves as well as those of the provinces. No clashes are envisaged between the functions of the Treasury and the Priorities Committee in view of the fact that the Treasury carries on normally with the task of determining the departmental estimates from year to year. The Priorities Committee will try to take a more long-term view and to have regard to the economy as a whole so that those projects which deserve a high priority can gradually be phased in to the extent as far as they fall within the capital resources of the country and do not exceed the amount allotted to the public sector.</p>
<p>During the period between 1974 and 1976 many of us were under the false impression that all our problems had been solved and that Government spending could practically go on unabated. We had to pay the price for that. We had a slow growth rate and a high inflation rate and drastic pruning measures had to be introduced, measures which often cut right down to the bone. Fortunately, we are over the worst and thanks to the co-operation that I received from all my colleagues, from the provinces, local authorities as well as State corporations and state institutions, we are today economically speaking in a much better position than we were then. It would therefore be unwise if we were once again to relax our discipline and drop our guard in respect of public spending. The reason that is advanced for such relaxation, for example, is that we are now suddenly expecting higher revenue from the gold mining industry and that that revenue can consequently be spent freely. It has been very difficult and has called for a great deal of sacrifice to reach the stage we have reached today as far as good growth prospects are concerned, and I intend keeping our economy basically sound and not yielding to any pressure. We simply cannot afford it. However, I should like to add that some of the projects on which we spent considerable amounts in the early years of this decade&#x2014;I have in mind particularly the Sishen-Saldanha railway line, the Saldanha Bay harbour, the Broodsnyersplaas-Ermelo railway line and the Richards Bay harbour complex&#x2014;have been excellent investments because those projects have established export capacity which is coming in very handy at the moment and which is earning the country millions of rands in foreign exchange. But then, other less essential projects should either have been delayed or postponed or even abandoned. By not doing so we made things difficult for ourselves.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that South Africa is not the only country that has experienced these problems. The Australian Government of the mid-&#x2019;seventies made the same mistakes, only much more so, and it was the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser who, shortly after he came into power a few years ago, was able to put the matter in perspective when he said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Over the past year or so the view has begun to develop that we can have it all without really having to pay for it. But one of the things we&#x2019;ve got to understand is that when politicians promise things, they are not promising anything of their own, because they have nothing of their own to give. They are promising something which is yours, and the more politicians promise, the less there s for you to meet your own needs or your family&#x2019;s needs; the less there is for industry, for investment, and to create jobs needed to improve the real wealth of Australia.</block>
<p>That was what Malcolm Fraser said.</p>
<p>I intend letting the Priorities Committee play an even more important role in future in the allocation of State funds. In the first instance it has to see to it that there is a gradual decline in the proportionate share of Government investment <i>ex</i> total investment to more reasonably long-term levels&#x2014;the ratio I have in mind is approximately 40%&#x2014; and secondly, it has to recommend which competing demands should be given priority. I have already received the second report of the committee in which the effect of SASOL III has been taken into account, and I can assure hon. Senators that the future does not appear very rosy. Naturally we have to give preference to strategic projects such as SASOL II and SASOL III as well as to UCOR. After that we have to ensure that the infrastructure keeps pace with the needs of the economy&#x2014;our railways, postal and communications systems, water, power and urban lines of communication, to mention only a few.</p>
<p>Whatever savings can be effected on what is spent on national roads, more will have to be spent on urban transport. In view of prevailing circumstances private transport will become more expensive and public transport will have to carry a heavier burden. Only recently suggestions have been made to myself and my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Transport, in connection with the financing of suburban transport and commuter services. We shall attend to this shortly and we hope to come forward with a more co-ordinated plan. But somebody will have to pay for it. As far as power is concerned, huge amounts are required for Koeberg and the next two giant coal power stations which will have to come into operation in the late &#x2018;eighties. We cannot fall behind as far as the provision of water is concerned and we shall have to spend a great deal on our communications system in order to increase productivity and to introduce new and modern techniques. What remains? Precious little, and that will have to be drastically reduced in any case. I trust that as far as this is concerned I shall be able to depend on the full co-operation of all my colleagues, of the Opposition and of all other public sector persons and bodies.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I should like in the first place to express our appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Finance for the copy of his speech which he sent to us. Secondly, I should like to apologize for the fact that our usual speaker on financial matters is unable to be here today.</p>
<p>I do not want to make exceptions, Sir, but I should like to mention certain matters which in the nature of things will come to the fore in my speech. The first point appears on page 13 of the speech of the hon. the Minister, as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Obviously certain sectors of the economy will be adversely affected by the increased prices and reduced supplies of liquid fuels and related products. However, certain other sectors such as mining should derive substantial net benefits from the recent developments.</block>
<p>The difference is drawn here between the various sectors. Later in my speech I shall refer to the following point&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On the contrary, as and when necessary, these policies will be modified in order to encourage the required restructuring of production and, wherever possible, to alleviate hardships&#x2014;I want to underline &#x201C;hardships&#x201D;&#x2014;caused by changes in relative prices and in the distribution of real income.</block>
<p>Mr. President, before I proceed with my prepared speech I should like to refer to page 32 where mention is made of the enormous amounts which are required for Koeberg. As you know, Sir, much has been written in recent times in our Press about the concern felt by the public regarding the construction of a nuclear power station on the West Coast of South Africa. I was particularly pleased to read in the supplement to <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i> of last Friday or Saturday a very interesting and enlightening article which stated precisely what this power station entailed. I should also like to recommend to my colleagues that they read this article because from time to time questions are put to us as public figures, and if hon. Senators can get a copy of that newspaper and make a study of that excellent exposition, they will all profit from it.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, when the budget was discussed during the first week of May and discussions continued during the following week, we ran out of time before I could enter the debate. Consequently I was unable to make my contribution at that particular stage. In a sense that may be a good thing, because much of what I would have said at that stage, will now remain unsaid. I feel, Sir, that every hon. Senator worthy of that name should feel that they have done the image of this hon. House a tremendous disservice by deliberately staging a walk-out to prevent a certain motion from being properly discussed in this hon. House. Much of what I may have said then can now rather be left unsaid. Certain happenings since that particular time, that is about one month ago, have somewhat altered the position, but apparently a great deal more will have to happen before the country will be able to settle down to the formidable tasks facing it. And what concerns me very much indeed at this particular moment are the serious problems that will have to be dealt with on the economic front, in the light of the staggering -increases in oil products announced last week.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, I feel that the disruption of our economy as a result of the tremendous increase in fuel prices is one of the worst catastrophies that has befallen us in many years. We are dealing here with the most sensitive artery in the lifeblood of the whole South African economy. It affects every imaginable industry throughout the country. There is not a single branch of our entire economic set-up in the country that can exist without this vitally important commodity, viz. fuel.</p>
<p>I can remember a speech made in this Upper House during my first period of office as a Senator. That was in the period 1961-&#x2019;65 when the late Senator George Sutter, a frontbencher on this side of the House, made an earnest appeal to the Government to change its attitude in regard to its internationally unpopular race policy. While discussing the matter, he emphasized with feeling how vulnerable we were regarding our dependence on oil supplies. This has become increasingly obvious now. Sasol I, Sasol II and later Sasol III will bring a measure of relief. Much has been written and speculated as to the possibility of the manufacture of fuel from sugar-cane or other vegetable matter, but this question is still at the castles-in-the-air stage. Anything resulting from this is something for the future and not for the present. We must look at the situation we have today. We must look at the present state of affairs. It is essential that we apply fuel-saving measures. Priorities must also be allocated. This is something which calls for our serious attention and in this regard I should like to refer to a few matters. We must ensure that our economy continues to expand and does not collapse. We must also ensure that inflation does not get completely out of hand. What is especially important is that the food producer must be enabled to put the necessary products on the market at a price which will prevent hunger and misery among the masses.</p>

<speech by="#oelrich">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:</from>
<p>In this connection I am reminded of a news item I heard earlier this week on the radio in which it was pointed out that the production costs of maize rose by 17% in 1978, and that with the latest increase in fuel prices this percentage would rise in the coming year to more than 40%. This is going to create an impossible position. Where will the less privileged section of the population find the necessary money to feed themselves and their families? The general tendency recently seems to be for consumer subsidies to disappear. In the present circumstances this is impossible in my view. The lower-income groups will have to be cared for, otherwise there will be chaos. Steps could surely be taken to use some of the profits of the higher gold price to reintroduce consumer subsidies for the lower-income groups, or to provide that coloured fuel, which we had previously, would be made available at lower prices to food producers and food processing institutions who are dependent upon fuel. Attention could even be given to the idea of suspending that portion of the duty on fuel accruing to the State to facilitate the production of food at a more reasonable price for the population.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, this side of the House has for years maintained that consumer subsidies are necessary. We have pleaded for consumer subsidies to make it possible for the lower income groups to buy the necessary foodstuffs for their families over a period of years. I can recall in debate after debate over the years when we were discussing the problems in respect of the prices of agricultural commodities, that it was pointed out how the primary producer was finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet on the prices fixed by the various control boards for their products. We suggested that these prices should be increased and that consumer prices should be subsidized. This was the practice for many years as far as butter is concerned. It also applied to other agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize, until a few years ago when the Government decided that these subsidies should disappear. Whether the Government was influenced by the terrific outcry in the Press every time any one of the control boards announced an increase in the price of any one commodity I do not know. What I have noticed is that each increase in food price raises screaming headlines, but not a word is written when the production costs of producers increase. This only happens in the agricultural journals, but of course they are not as widely read by the general public as the daily Press. I mentioned the instance of what I heard over the radio only a few days ago about the increase in production costs of 17% in 1978 and which, because of the new fuel price, is expected to rise to over 40% in the coming year. I have gone to a lot of trouble to find a cutting of this news item in a newspaper, but without success.</p>
<p>I have made the suggestion that steps should be taken to meet this serious situation. For the life of me I cannot see that it would be unfair to claim that the public are entitled to some relief or other out of the increased gold prices. There certainly seems to be a correlation between the escalation in the price of oil and the higher prices paid for gold today. Where the consuming public has to pay so much more for all the oil products it requires, and whereas the State on the other hand is the beneficiary as far as the higher gold price is concerned, I sincerely feel that there is every justification for suggesting that the one increase should be used in the best possible manner to offset the other. To my mind no more deserving case can be made out for the food consuming members of our public, particularly the less affluent sections of the population including all pensioners who are finding the escalating cost of living a tremendous hardship.</p>
<p>One of South Africa&#x2019;s top industrialists, Dr. Anton Rupert, said quite a few years ago about our Black homelands and adjacent Black territories that if they do not eat, we will not sleep. I think we can confirm that and add that without oil, industry and commerce will grind to a halt. This would be terribly serious and a catastrophe. It would not only lead to massive unemployment, but to revolution and chaos on a large scale. This reminds one of the words of a former Prime Minister who maintained that if there was one thing that gave him sleepless nights it was the threat of large-scale unemployment amongst the masses in South Africa.</p>
<p>I admit that I have presented a very sombre picture of a situation which must be tackled in earnest and without delay. If one has to add another thought to the one I uttered just now about industry and commerce grinding to a halt if there are insufficient quantities of oil, it is that South Africa will then starve as a result of that because we will not be able to produce sufficient quantities of food. I wish to repeat that action is urgently needed. All possible measures to stimulate the economy must be employed without delay, otherwise we are in danger of scaring off investment capital, which will lead to unemployment and all the dangers that that may entail. Steps to lighten the onerous task of the primary producer must receive priority or we will face serious food shortages, not only in the Republic but also in our neighbouring territories, who for long months of every year are totally dependent upon us for food supplies.</p>
<p>We must realize that our very survival depends on positive action at an early date. Whatever steps the hon. the Minister of Finance can take to inject more money into the economy, must be done soon to have the maximum effect. Suggestions made earlier on during the budget speeches about an earlier repayment of the longest outstanding loan levy, for instance, would help a great deal. Other good suggestions followed and I want to stress again that in my view the situation in the Republic is extremely serious and requires immediate attention and drastic steps to avoid disaster befalling us.</p>
<p>Sir, these are not only my opinions but also those of people I have been talking to over the last couple of days who are very concerned indeed about this terrific hike in the price of our fuel supplies in South Africa. This is something that none of us can take the blame for; it is a world situation.</p>
<p>*I am grateful, Sir, that in his speech the hon. the Minister indicated that he was fully aware of certain of these problems. But I did feel that it was necessary for me once again to stress this one particular factor pertinently, this particular section of our industry in South Africa, because I think this is something which is extremely necessary. It is not necessary for me to repeat what I have already said this year regarding supplies to the farmer, the high capital costs involved, etc. I hope the hon. the Minister will kindly give his attention to this matter as he has done in the past.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want to associate myself with many of the things the hon. Senator Oelrich has said today. I can only agree with what he has said and later in my speech I shall return to some important points he has raised.</p>
<p>I want to start by congratulating the hon. the Minister on having been able in the past year to overcome many of the problems we have been experiencing, and on the success he has achieved with his policy of financial discipline and his policy of growth from strength. When I think of what he said, I can summarize it as follows: What are the priorities? The first priority is to ensure that we have a reasonably fast economic growth rate. That aim is still high on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s list, and he is quite correct, particularly in view of the fact that it is so essential to provide employment opportunities for our fast-growing population. That is one of our problems and in the years that lie ahead it will remain one of our great problems.</p>
<p>The second problem connected with it, especially as a result of the increased oil price and in respect of which we have not had any success yet, is the question of inflation. We must in all honesty admit, and I think the hon. the Minister has on occasion admitted it, that the one question in respect of which we have not yet achieved the necessary success is the question of inflation. We have not yet overcome that problem although it did appear some time ago as though we were having some success, even if to a small extent. But now, as result of the increased price of fuel we are realizing afresh how difficult it is to overcome this serious question, how to control it. During the past few years our enemy has been inflation and it remains our enemy number one together with enemy number two, namely the slow rate of our economic growth.</p>
<p>It is of particular importance for us to aim at two objectives: We shall have to encourage and achieve a fast economic growth rate and control the rate of inflation at the same time. That is no easy task, Sir, because the one often gives rise to the other. I want to say something that I have already said in the past in this hon. House and that is that we must try to solve one of the problems which we have not yet been able to overcome and which is contributing to this problem of inflation, namely, satisfactory productivity in the South African economy. Over the years I have on various occasions pleaded for that in this hon. House. This afternoon I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance something which I have already asked the hon. the Minister of Labour. We have often discussed this. Cannot we do something more positive? We must have an in-depth look at this matter and I suggest the appointment of a working committee.</p>
<p>The third point to which the hon. the Minister has referred is a serious problem&#x2014; we admit that this is very serious problem that has come into existence&#x2014;namely, the redistribution of income that is taking place. On the one hand we have the enormous rise in the price of gold which has assisted us to a large extent in paying the increased price for oil. It has meant increased foreign reserves to us but coupled with that we have the problem of the redistribution of income. The tendency is to give more to those who have and to make it more difficult for those who have not. That is the effect of the increased gold price on the one hand and the increase in the price of fuel on the other hand. This tendency can have a far-reaching effect on the income distribution pattern in South Africa.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has rightly referred to that and we shall even have to reconsider many of the things that we did not wish to do in the past, things which we perhaps regarded as evil. One of the questions referred to is the question to which the hon. Senator Oelrich has rightly referred, namely, the question of subsidizing the consumer in some way or other, directly or indirectly. I shall return to this at a later stage.</p>
<p>I think this question is one which most certainly deserves serious consideration and I am convinced that the time has arrived for the extremely efficient economists in his department to put their heads together and consult other economists and other branches of industry and departments to see what can be done about it.</p>
<p>I want to refer to one other point to which the hon. the Minister has also referred, namely that of a priorities committee. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this because I think it is an extremely wise step. However, I want to put this question to him: Does he not see his way clear to have the agricultural industry represented on that committee? I have a specific reason for asking this. There are three factors in our country and in any other country that produce wealth, namely, industry, agriculture and mining. The hon. the Minister mentioned two of these, namely industries and mining but he omitted agriculture. The agricultural industry is faced with many problems, particularly a shortage of water in certain parts of the country. And it is obvious that a large amount of money will have to be spent on the provision of water. I have in mind particularly the Kalahari with its tremendous potential for food production but which, due to an insufficient supply of water, cannot be developed properly.</p>
<p>That brings me to something which I have very seldom raised in this House, particularly on an occasion such as this, but which I have long since wanted to raise. However, for a number of years I have not had the opportunity of doing so and I want to raise it today. As I have said, Sir, there are three factors that produce wealth, two of which are doing fairly well. The mining industry is faring exceedingly well and the position of the industrial sector has improved. It did not suffer very greatly during the recession we have just experienced. Its position did, of course, deteriorate; profitability dropped last year from 21% to 19,6% on shareholder investment. But it remains a highly profitable industry and it is hopefully on the upswing. All the signs seem to indicate that the profits of the companies in South Africa will again be appreciably higher. There are daily reports in the newspapers of the big increases in the profits of big mining houses or large industrial concerns. That is right, that is fine, that is what we want. However, there is one industry of which I cannot say the same and that is the agricultural industry. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister of Finance is here because it is said that in any country the Minister of Finance is the second most powerful person and that is, in fact, the case. That is why it is so important that we have his sympathy, his goodwill and his ear&#x2014;if I may put it that way&#x2014;in respect of a matter which we think is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>I want today to have a more serious look at the Government&#x2019;s priorities and agriculture. I want to say immediately that I am aware and deeply appreciative of what has been done for agriculture in the past. But at the same time I want to say that somewhere along the line there is a misconception. Unfortunately, a large section of the public has a wrong opinion about the agricultural industry. The broad public&#x2014;and perhaps many semi-public bodies if not public bodies&#x2014;have the wrong picture of the agricultural industry. It is not a good picture; we have to admit that. Let me say immediately the agricultural industry itself is largely to blame for this. The agricultural industry has not done enough to make the facts known; the industry has not done enough to collate the facts, to investigate them and to make them public.</p>
<p>I want to give hon. Senators a few facts today. I looked at the 1979-&#x2019;80 estimates of expenditure to find out what the Government was contributing to the various industrial sectors. I found that for this financial year the Government had budgeted for a total amount of R734 million in respect of the manufacturing industry&#x2014;that is current plus capital amounts. In respect of the mining industry the amount is R186 million and in respect of the agricultural industry it is R193 million. In other words, the amount in respect of the manufacturing industry is very much higher than in the case of the other two sectors together. Let me say immediately, Sir, that the manufacturing industry deserves it. I have no objection to that whatsoever. If more money had been available I think that even more could have been earmarked for that industry. If one expresses those figures in terms of a yardstick to which I know the Department of Finance attaches great importance, namely the ratio of those figures to the GDP, one gets the following figures: In respect of the manufacturing industry it was R34 million for every R1 million it contributed to the GDP; in respect of the mining industry it was R23 million and in respect of the agricultural industry it was R26 million. When one takes the current amounts the position remains more or less the same, except that the manufacturing industry compares slightly more favourably in that case, but one cannot exclude the capital amount. In the case of the current amounts the figure is R12,4 million for the manufactoring industry, R15,3 million for the agricultural industry and R21,5 million for the mining industry. One must take the totals, Sir, because financial assistance in the form of loans or capital is valuable assistance to the industry concerned. The conclusion is clear. The image of agriculture, namely, that it is very heavily subsidized by the State, is not a true and correct reflection of the actual position. I obtained these figures from the statements of the various Government Departments and re-arranged them in accordance with the department to which they belonged. I discussed the position with various people and no one differed from me. Then this question was put to me: &#x201C;What about the total capital resources that the State has in the Land Bank, etc.? Does that not perhaps favour the agricultural industry?&#x201D; I then found that the total amount spent by the State on the promotion of the manufacturing industry amounted to the sum of R5 503 million as at 28 February. That does not include guarantees. Hon. Senators will remember that provision was made in the Bill we have just passed for guarantees to public industrial corporations to an amount of nearly R300 million. This figure, therefore, is even higher; if the lastmentioned amount is added, the amount is R5 800 million.</p>
<p>In the case of agriculture, and here I am taking the Land Bank and the Agricultural Credit Board, the amount is only R2 293 million. From this point of view, therefore, Sir, the agricultural industry is once again not what people believe it to be; the State does not carry the industry to such a large extent; its bread is not buttered on both sides.</p>
<p>Something which we often take into account is direct subsidies. The hon. Senator Oelrich spoke about direct subsidies; he spoke about consumer subsidies. I think the Government has set aside an amount of approximately R124 million for that purpose this year. There was a time when we thought we would have to phase it out. We were justified in thinking that, Sir. But as a result of the redistribution of income with its resultant adverse implications and complications, there is no doubt that we shall have to take another look at this position.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister rightly mentioned this in his speech today. I think he was absolutely correct. It is often maintained that it is the agriculturist who gets those subsidies.</p>
<p>But he does not get them and it is not right to say that he does. The hon. the Minister has said this on occasion and I applaud him for it. According to the estimates for 1979-&#x2019;80 the manufacturing industry is being directly subsidized to the tune of approximately R119 million, agriculture to the tune of R39 million and mining to the tune of R25 million. In other words, mining gets the least and the manufacturing industry by far the most.</p>
<p>I myself have always been under a totally wrong impression. I thought it was true that agriculture was getting the major share of the subsidies but that is not the position. Sir, you will once again realize that the public has a wrong image of the agricultural industry. It is our fault; I do not blame anybody for it. We have never yet put all the facts to the public. If we did so the public would view the industry in a different light.</p>
<p>I should like to apply another yardstick that we cannot ignore and that is the following: Money is important; to generate wealth is important, but I say wealth is a privilege; It is not a right. But labour, the opportunity to work, is a right and not a privilege. Let us see what agriculture does in that respect. If one takes that as a basis, agriculture together with forestry&#x2014;in this case I have included forestry but not in the other cases&#x2014;provides work for 2,5 million people as against 1,3 million by the manufacturing industry and approximately 0,75 million by mining. That is the position today, Sir. While being grateful for what has been done, let me say at once that we should not look to agriculture and to mining to provide more work opportunities for our growing population because they are already more or less fully developed industries; they no longer have the growth potential. We have to look to our manufacturing industry. But then, just because agriculture is already providing employment for the vast majority of people, we should not take it for granted. In saying that I am not suggesting that anybody does take agriculture for granted, except the public. I am afraid, Sir, that a large section of the consumer public takes agriculture for granted and that is not right. The agricultural industry is by far the biggest single employer of labour of all branches of industry in South Africa. Let us express that in terms of another yardstick, namely, what the Government budgets for per employee in respect of these three branches of industry. These are interesting figures, Sir. At the moment, as far as the manufacturing industry is concerned, the Government budgets for an amount of R565 per employee; in the case of mining the amount is R266 per employee and in the case of agriculture the amount is R95 per employee. This is not the industry, therefore, that is being carried to the large extent to which the public believes it to be. If one expresses these figures in terms of direct subsidies per employee, what then is the position of the various industries? These are interesting figures, Sir. The manufacturing industry receives an amount of R91 per employee in direct subsidy, mining R35 and agriculture R15. This is an important yardstick, Sir. I say wealth is important but our greatest future task is to provide employment. Let us keep what we have because those are important avenues of employment.</p>
<p>We have said that the contribution by agriculture to the GDP is low. That is so. One of the main reasons why it is low is not only because its employees are unskilled or semi-skilled but also because the industry is not profitable. Let me make some comparisons. Take the returns in the manufacturing industry expressed in terms of shareholder interest as published in the statement of the Department of Finance. According to that statement the return in the case of commerce was 21,5% for the year 1977-&#x2019;78; in the case of the manufacturing industry the figure was somewhat lower, namely 19,6%&#x2014;it was higher the previous year&#x2014;and in the case of agriculture the figure was 3,4%, expressed in terms of available figures. The price of land has been adjusted and if I take only 60% of the land value, as estimated by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, then the percentage yield is nothing more than 5,5%. I have spoken to various economists and they agree that 60% is a reasonable percentage; they cannot find fault with that.</p>
<p>That being the position, Sir, do you realize what the problem of agriculture is? The problem is that of itself its margin of profit even in good years&#x2014;and agriculture has had very good years in the recent past&#x2014;is inadequate, and is even more than inadequate to allow it to make provision for the bad years. The moment times are bad, the man who lives on the breadline will find himself in difficulty. He manages while things go well but, as soon as times get hard, he has to be assisted, otherwise he will go under.</p>
<p>There is one point that I wish to stress in this hon. House today and that is that the profitability of the agricultural industry is not adequate enough to be healthy. It is untenably low. What is its position? We know that the Government does not play a major role in commerce, industry and mining when it comes to price determinations. The price of those products is mostly determined by the principle of supply and demand. But in the case of the agricultural industry the Government, indirectly and sometimes directly, determines more than 60% of its prices, be they minimum and/or fixed prices. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs said recently that the Government had a 64% control in this case. The contribution made by the South African agricultural industry to keep the cost of living low, particularly in the &#x2019;seventies, was out of all proportion to its ability to make that contribution. It was unable to do so but it did so nevertheless. But now that there are signs of lowering clouds such as drought conditions and other difficulties, the industry is experiencing problems. In no other industrial sphere in South Africa does one find that uncontrollable problem. It is a problem over which the farmer has no control. Nobody has any control over it. I am now talking about climatic circumstances such as droughts and so forth. In South Africa one can be sure of two things, Sir, namely death and drought. The lastmentioned occurs periodically. As I see the position, Sir, we are faced with the position today that if the drought conditions that still prevail in certain parts of the country continue into the second half of this year&#x2014;and that is very possible&#x2014; the agricultural industry will be faced with the most serious crisis it has ever experienced. Over a period of four years the debts of the farming community have increased by over 50%. I have all the figures here. The outstanding debts have doubled, and that is not because they are bad farmers. From the very nature of things there are bad farmers as well; but their invidious position is due mainly to the fact that their margin of profit is too low. The margin of profit is insufficient to enable them to make provision for difficult years and to enable them to withstand those difficult years.</p>
<p>I should like to bring a certain matter very strongly to the attention of the hon. the Minister of Finance and that is the boycott by housewives&#x2014;something which I do not understand&#x2014;-of agricultural products the moment prices are increased. When the price of manufactured goods is increased, nothing is said about it. The housewives accept that and say it is unavoidable. That is so and it is quite right. But the moment the price of agricultural products is increased, what does one hear then? Whatever the farmer does is not right, and the image the general public has of the farmer is one of someone who rides around in a luxury motorcar. Some of them do ride around in luxury motor-cars but there are many more people riding around in luxury motor-cars who are not farmers. The public says the bread of the farmer is buttered on both sides; that the farmer is never satisfied and is continually asking the Government for assistance. The farmers do not deserve the false image the public has of them.</p>
<p>The more successful those boycotts are, Sir, the more destructive their effect will be on the ability of the agricultural sector to produce food in future. The public did not want dairy produce prices to be increased and eventually the farmers said that they could not make ends meet. They then left the industry and today there are shortages. Today that action has had a boomerang effect on the consumer.</p>
<p>I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to do everything he can, to use his influence because we need him today more than ever before, to help us in correcting this incorrect image of the agricultural industry. We must do some soul-searching of our own. I am the last person to suggest that there is no fault to find with the agricultural industry. I want to admit immediately that agricultural industry also has its faults. One weakness in particular is the lack of adequate financial planning. That is a weakness in our farming industry. What do we expect of a farmer? He is a mechanic, he is a manager, he is a salesman. Many demands are made upon him, more demands than I could mention. If heavy demands are made of someone, one must realize that it is very difficult for that person to meet all those demands. It is not an easy task today to make a success of a large farming unit. To do so one must be more than fairly efficient. I make bold to say that generally speaking we have an efficient farming community in South Africa. However, I want to encourage them to be even more efficient and in particular to concentrate on financial planning. But if one&#x2019;s profit margin is not high enough one can plan as much as one likes but one will still be in difficulties. That is the problem.</p>
<p>I want to conclude by asking our agricultural unions, the agricultural industry as a whole and every member of the public&#x2014; every one of us will at some time or other feel the effect if the things that are wrong are not put right&#x2014;to assist in converting the wrong image of the agricultural industry into an image which it deserves on merit. Secondly, the State should have another in-depth look at all the facets of this branch of industry in order to ascertain what has to be done so as to increase its profitability. The intention is not to promote the interests of one industry over and above those of another. I know what the value of the manufacturing industry is. These three legs, these three wealth-producing industrial sectors, namely, agriculture, mining and the manufacturing industry, are like the three legs of a table. One cannot chop one leg off and think the table will remain upright. They are very much interdependent and are linked together. We know and appreciate what the State has done for the agricultural industry. But no one will hold it against me when I say that I think we should look afresh at the priorities in the Government&#x2019;s year-to-year budgeting, with special attention to the agricultural industry. I thank the hon. the Minister of Finance for that. I wish him, as well as his staff, <i>inter alia</i>, Dr. De Loor who is sitting over there and who is his right-hand man, together with Dr. De Kock and the Reserve Bank, everything of the best and strength to cope with the extremely difficult and responsible task that awaits them in the coming year.</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want to start by congratulating the hon. Senator Dr. Visser on his speech here this afternoon. He did a favour and rendered a service to the whole farming community of South Africa this afternoon.</p>
<p>†The hon. Senator Dr. Visser started by dealing with the other sectors of the economy and I will come back to those in a minute. He said that all sectors were doing well except agriculture. This speech of his could almost have been prompted by the contribution of my leader, the hon. Senator Oelrich, a little earlier, who also paid tribute to the farmers of the country. For once I find myself in a debate where I am following two speakers, one from either side of the House, who are totally <i>ad idem.</i></p>
<p>However, I think there are a few points which must also be pointed out regarding the agricultural industry in this country. In the first place I believe that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser was totally correct when he said that in order to keep prices low, the agricultural industry was asked to carry a load which it can no longer bear. I must say to the hon. the Minister in all sincerity that I am sorry that he is sitting alone here this afternoon and that there were no other hon. members of the Cabinet here to listen to these two contributions by the two hon. Senators Oelrich and Visser. I believe there was a lot of good, sound common sense in what they said and if lessons can be learnt from what they have said, the whole of the country and the whole economy of the country can benefit from it.</p>
<p>Let me say right away that this statement by the hon. Senator Dr. Visser comes right back to the marketing system, to the marketing and pricing policy that has been applied throughout the previous years. He does not say it in a spirit of criticism, and at this stage I do not want to apportion the blame because I am not quite sure where it should lie, whether it lies with Government policy, with the policy of marketing boards or wherever it might lie. But the hon. Senator Dr. Visser and myself are <i>ad idem</i> here, and I hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will carry this message to his colleagues in the Cabinet, and say &#x201C;There is something wrong, please put it right&#x201D;, because they are the only ones who are in a position to do so. We cannot do it Neither the hon. Senator Dr. Visser nor myself nor anyone else in this hon. House can do it.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I must remind the hon. Senator Dr. Visser and the hon. the Minister that in the past we have asked for assistance for farmers. The hon. the Minister will remember that during the budget debate the NRP repeatedly asked for efforts to reduce the production or input costs of the agricultural sector. One of the things that he can do because it is in his power&#x2014;-and here I speak to the hon. the Minister personally&#x2014;is to reduce the levies and the duties that apply to input costs of the farmers. He knows that we have asked for that before, and I do not want to belabour that point now. Before I am tempted to turn this into an agricultural debate, Sir, I think I must turn back to other sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser quitely rightly said at the beginning of his speech that we must stimulate growth, that this is the biggest problem in this country. I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree with him in that regard. He said that industry is faring better, that company profits have increased and that this is what he gathers from reports. Let me say to you. Sir, that he is quite correct. If one sits in an ivory tower and depends upon the financial reports which pertain only to the larger companies in this country, then one can only come to the conclusion that industry is doing better because company profits are increasing. But let me say to him right now that I believe that applies only to the larger companies in this country. Because when one gets down into the market-place and moves among the smaller men, one finds a completely different picture, and particularly in the commercial sector. One finds a picture not quite of gloom but one of optimism tempered by reality. There is optimism on the one hand as a result of the emergence of an economy which today, there is no doubt about it, is stronger than it was a year ago.</p>

<p>Order! Hon. Senators must whisper a little more softly, please. The hon. Senator may continue.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Thank you, Sir. As I was saying, this optimism is tempered by concern for the prevailing realities. And those prevailing realities include the following points which I believe are the ones to which the hon. the Minister will have to pay attention.</p>
<p>The first one is the delay in the implementation of the main budget concessions. I think one of my colleagues in the Other Place dubbed this a mark time budget or a delayed action budget That money that will be in the hands of the taxpayer after the tax concessions reach him from July, is needed in their hands now. In fact, they needed it immediately the budget was announced. There is a decline in retail turnovers, with the exception again of the large chain stores. Three or four of them could be named but I don&#x2019;t think they should be named here. They are the only ones that have shown slight increases in turnover. But generally retail turnovers have gone down since Easter.</p>
<p>There is still a large unutilized manufacturing capacity and tied to that is the lack of incentive to invest. I want to deal more fully with that in a moment, Sir. There is continuing high unemployment; the inflation rate, I am sure, even causes concern to the hon. the Minister, there is a declining real and disposable income among the people of South Africa; and, of course, the escalating fuel prices cause the biggest concern of all.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the points that I have made, Sir, it is agreed in the market-place that the main emphasis must continue to be on economic growth by encouraging consumer spending, and it is only in that sector that we see the opportunity of creating growth in the economy. And it is this encouragement that will lead to the utilization of spare capacity, that will encourage investment and will provide the needed employment.</p>
<p>We have the economic situation in this country at the moment where the State has plenty of money. The gold bonanza, the general sales tax, other fiscal measures introduced by the hon. the Minister have resulted in the State not being short of money. For that reason we had a budget in March which announced concessions, concessions which, mainly, are only going to be felt from now on. But, Sir, those concessions have already been eaten up. They have already been eaten up by the increase in the inflation rate. At the moment the inflation rate stands at 12,7%, and the estimate of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs when he announced this last increase in the price of fuel was that this would add another 1,9% to the inflation rate. We are therefore now expecting an inflation rate of approximately 15%. We are well into the fire zone. We are in the danger zone. And I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister has seen the warning signs and that the Government is going to take the necessary steps to save the country from getting deep into that fire. And when we look at that figure, we should also look at the increase in the cost of foodstuffs. This was referred to by my friend, the hon. Senator Oelrich. We find that the April figure in regard to increases in the cost of foodstuffs compared with that of a year ago was 15,7%, and that was before the increases in the prices of administered foods such as maize, oilseed and dairy products that have been announced and also before the latest increase in the price of fuel. With that in mind it looks as if we are this year heading for an increase in the price of foodstuffs in the region of 20%. And the question must be asked: How are our people, particularly those who have fixed incomes and those in the lower income groups, going to exist under these circumstances?</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>The pensioners are of course included.</p>
<p>Sir, as I have said, it is necessary to stimulate consumer demand. That can only be done if they have a real increase in take-home pay&#x2014;if they have a real increase in their disposable income. For that reason I want to ask the hon. the Minister this afternoon to make certain concessions. He has the power. He does not have to come back to Parliament to get permission and in those cases where he has to get parliamentary approval he still has time to do so.</p>
<p>I believe the first thing he must do is to abolish the 7&#x00BD;% surcharge on import duty. This is multiplied in the market-place, as he knows, and by the time the consumer gets the article the surcharge is considerably more than 7&#x00BD;%. He must also abolish the <i>ad valorem</i> excise duty on those goods to which it still applies. That is the old sales duty, and this is also multiplied. With the advent of the general sales tax I do not believe that this is necessary any longer. And I would remind you, Sir, that the Government is not short of money. This will help to reduce the cost of living burden but in addition to that it is going to place in the hands of businessmen additional funds that are necessary because of the increased cost of stocks and necessary if they are to expand and develop.</p>
<p>Again I believe that the hon. the Minister should immediately repay all outstanding loan levies and also drop the current levy on personal tax. This will place more money in the hands of the buying public, it will help consumer spending and it will help businessmen as well.</p>
<p>It is true that the hon. the Minister and his colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, have repeatedly tried to encourage growth and stimulate the economy of the country. They have spoken confidently of the growth in the economy. I believe that there are sectors&#x2014;and the hon. Senator Dr. Visser agrees with me&#x2014;that need further stimulation. They need more than just words from the hon. the Minister and his colleagues. They need something concrete that they can show as their way of also helping to stimulate this confidence. The first timid steps in the growth of South Africa have been taken.</p>

<p>Timid?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Of course they were timid because businessmen were anxious about this. They were not too certain that they would not burn their fingers. That is the reason why all our financial institutions today are sitting sated with money. They are begging people to borrow money and to develop because they are sitting with more money than they know what to do with. That is why I say those were timid steps that were taken. Those people are going to withdraw unless the State will now put its money where its mouth is. This it can do by having regard to the points I suggested just now.</p>
<p>When we come to the poorer people, the pensioners and those with fixed incomes, and we find that the cost of living has gone up to 15,7%, I must add my voice to that of the hon. Senator Oelrich and ask the hon. the Minister to use his gold profits to subsidize the cost of basic foodstuffs. I know that there are millions of rands, including a special amount of R20 million, budgeted for subsidies to assist the consumer.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-finance">

<p>The R20 million was an increase on the R50 million already being spent in this regard.</p>

<p>With respect to the hon. the Minister, we had R20 million last year as well.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>It is an increase on the R50 million we have already provided.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>We had R50 million plus R20 million last year and we have R50 million plus R20 million this year. We will not argue about it, it is the same as last year. There is no further amount for subsidies than there was last year. With regard to pensioners I believe the time has come for the hon. the Minister to use the money he has to give the pensioners something now. They have to live between now and 1 October when they are to get an increase in their pensions and I do not believe that the Minister can be justified in withholding that increase any longer. I must ask him to give that to them now.</p>
<p>The last request I have to make of the hon. Minister in this regard is to rebate duties on food products and essential items. There are duties on food products besides the general sales tax and I am sure that the hon. the Minister can rebate those. I want to give him one example which affects the poorest sections of our economy, and that is the example of paraffin. I spoke about paraffin here earlier this session. With the advent of the levy of 6c the price of paraffin increased from 12c to 18c a litre. Do you know, Sir, that today paraffin sells for 33c a litre? When we think that that paraffin is used by the poorest sections of the economy for light, for cooking and for heating, I believe that this is one instance in particular where the hon. the Minister can talk to his colleagues and see whether there is a chance of relieving this tremendous burden of the poorer sections of our economy.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister and the hon. Senator Oelrich dealt with the high price of fuel and I think the time has come when we have to get this matter into perspective in South Africa. I believe we have to find out why we are in this position and why we are paying these tremendous prices for fuel.</p>
<p>World consumption is at the moment approximately 57 million barrels of crude oil per day. There is a shortfall which amounts to approximately 2 million barrels a day&#x2014;in other words, a 5% shortage. Therefore, I do not believe that our problem in South Africa is caused by a world shortage of fuel. Other countries in the world also have that problem of the 5% shortage for which they are bargaining with other countries.</p>
<p>I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that if it was only that 5% we were bargaining for and if it was only that 5% that we had to buy on the spot market our situation would not be as serious as it is today. The United States, the largest consumer which consumes about 70% of the daily consumption, is 5% short. There they are fighting over supplies, but that is because they are the largest consumer and 5% means a large amount short to them. But the United States of America, when it buys oil outside, is paying between 18 and 20 dollars a barrel. Europe, which is the second largest consumer, is also facing economic problems because of the increases in the price of fuel to Europe. What are those increases? Since Iran went out of production the price of market crude which in December was $12,81 has increased to $18,47. Market crude can still be purchased for that price. This is an increase of 50%. This is a tremendous increase and that is why the economists of these other countries are affected. But what is the position regarding South Africa?</p>

<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>I am coming to the Ayatollah. The Republic was dependent upon Iran for most of its supplies of oil. I can only assume that the contracts we had with Iran up to December when they were terminated, would have been at 12 to 14 dollars a barrel which was the ruling price at that time. That oil is no longer available to us. But what oil is available to us? This is where the crunch comes. There is an embargo in our regard by all the Opec countries, and we have therefore been forced to buy most of our oil on what is called the spot market The spot market is a market which originates in Rotterdam. Oil is offered there at between 34 and 36 dollars a barrel. This is what is reported but nobody can get any official figure of precisely what purchasers pay on that spot market. We do not know what the Republic is paying either. All that we can assume because of these tremendous increases we have had is that we are having to buy on the spot market. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has conceded that point. [Interjections.] I have to accept his word because I have no evidence to the contrary.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>I am going to tell the hon. Senator what the argument is. This means that South Africa is paying for its oil not an increase of 50% but of 300%. We are now paying 300% more for our oil than we paid in December. Again the question has to be asked: Why? Why are we compelled to pay those prices? Is it for economic reasons? Is it because we cannot pay our debts? Is it because we do not have any money? Is it because we produce gold? I believe the answer to all these questions is no. I believe the answer to the question is because this is the price that we are paying for apartheid. This is the price of apartheid. It is the next instalment [Interjections.] We are the polecat of the world, as my friend says. This price that we are paying is the price we have to pay for the policy of the Government which is absolute anathema to other countries in the world, just as it is to many of us who oppose the Government in this country. I think the people of South Africa must know and understand that we are paying these high prices because of apartheid. The embargo against South Africa is not for any other reason but the internal policies of the Government When I say that this is a further instalment in the price of apartheid I must remind the Senate of the way in which we have had to disguise our exports. We have had to send cans to other countries to be labelled there so that they could sell them somewhere else. I have to remind the Senate of the arms embargo which is costing us five or six times what we should be paying for the defence of this country. [Interjections.] I do not know what that noise is all about.</p>

<p>I do not believe, notwithstanding the noise made by the hon. Senator, that the Government can claim credit for the increase in the price of gold. It has played a part, there is no doubt about it. The international gold marketing organization has also played a part, but I do not believe they can claim all the credit for this.</p>
<p>Sums have been done regarding the increase in the price of gold to show that the increase in the price of gold is commensurate with the increase in the price of oil. One can just imagine the situation South Africa would have been in if we had not been subject to the pressures of political embargoes, if we had been able to buy our fuel at the rate at which other countries in the world are importing oil. During May the European countries imported oil&#x2014;depending on the grade&#x2014;at prices ranging from $17 to $21 a barrel, but on the admission of these hon. Senators &#x2026;</p>

<p>It is impossible to talk against that noise, Sir. Hon. Senators here have conceded that we are not getting fuel at that price, or not very much of it, if we are getting any. We are being compelled to pay the spot prices which could be anything up to $36 a barrel. If we had our gold bonanza and fuel at the price of $18 to $21 a barrel, imagine then, Sir, what the economic state of this country would have been. Imagine then, Sir, the finance, the funds that would have been available for development, the very growth which the hon. the Minister wants, the growth that the hon. Senator Visser wants, the growth that we all want. How much of that could have been stimulated with our gold profits if we were paying a realistic price for our fuel? [Interjections.] Think of the confidence this would have instilled in the minds of investors in this country, investors both within the country and from outside the country, to invest in this country.</p>
<p>I must end, Sir, and I want to say this, that what South Africa needs now is a new Government. [Interjections.] It needs a Government which will move away from apartheid, a government that will leave apartheid alone and that will ensure freedom and justice for all our people in this country. [Interjections.] Then we would not be facing the situation that we face now of hardship, tremendous hardship, among our people locally.</p>
<p>There is one last word I want to address to the hon. the Minister on this point. There is one price which is more sensitive than all others, and that is the price of public transport, bus fares. This latest increase in the price of fuel, this levy of 15 cents a litre which has been imposed, means to one major carrier, a bus company transporting people daily, an increase of R2,5 million in their fuel bill. That is R2,5 million increase in their running expenses. That can only result in an increase in bus fares. The question of bus fares in the past has been a point of conflagration, a flash-point around which we have had riots, we have had strikes, we have had troubles within the country. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if it is not possible in view of the gold profits we have, in some way to alleviate that situation&#x2014;and this is my last demand of him this afternoon&#x2014;where the bus-users of this country can get some sort of rebate. Whether the dieseline is coloured, or the petrol the bus companies use, whatever system might be preferred, I think a case can be made out for a rebate of this particular levy in the interests of happiness, of stability and of peace within the country.</p>

Senator Marais Viljoen, <i>in absentia</i>, who has today been chosen as candidate for the State President. If one is a candidate for the NP, one can say one is a candidate for South Africa. I should like to congratulate him most heartily. It seems as if the older it becomes and the closer it comes to its demise, the more the Senate accomplishes. This will be the first time in the history of the Republic of South Africa that we have chosen a State President from the members of the Senate. We should like to congratulate him most warmly. I do not want to go into the financial problems of the country, as previous speakers have done. I just want to say that as long as Senator Horwood, our present Minister of Finance, is at the head of affairs and manages things as he is doing at the moment, the country does not have much to worry about for the future as far as our financial affairs are concerned.</p>

<speech by="#loock">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. J. H. LOOCK</person>:</from>
<p>I do not want to talk so much about party politics but about the political position of South Africa apart from its economic position. I should like to connect my remarks in that respect to a letter which I read yesterday in one of the newspapers. It is a letter from an American in the death cell in America. The letter reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">As a prisoner on death row in the State of Texas, who watches with interest all proceedings having to do with the death penalty, I am amazed at the attitude of my President towards the subject. He will interfere along with his buddy, Andrew Young, in the internal affairs of South Africa when they execute a Black terrorist, but stand mute when a person is executed in this country. I am ashamed of my country&#x2019;s policy towards South Africa and want the people of your country to know that our politicians in power do not speak for the majority of the people of this country. Andrew Young is nothing more than a Black racist, a communist agitator, who has advocated the destruction of White society in order to advance the cause of the Black race, no doubt hoping to be the next President. In case you wonder, I believe the death penalty to be justified in some cases, therefore this letter is not one seeking sympathy for my own predicament. I do want the people of South Africa to know that even a person whom society has condemned can still feel insulted and embarrassed by his country&#x2019;s two-faced policy towards their own, which goes much further than an interference in the execution of a Black terrorist.</block>
<p>This is a man who writes a message to the people of South Africa from the death cell in America. He complains about the double standards according to which we are judged by his country and the world today. The question is: What really is the aim of the international community, both of the communist and the Western countries? Is it their intention to destroy South Africa, to destroy the White man in South Africa and to destroy the role of the White man in Africa? Are they doing it in respect of oil or in respect of trade or in what respect? We are at the crossroads today as far as the future of South Africa is concerned and as far as the future of the White man in Africa is concerned.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago I was in Ghana where a revolution is now in progress. I was there in the time of Nkrumah. At the entrance to their parliament there was a large white map on which there were only five black spots which were the then independent countries, viz. Egypt, Abyssinia, Ghana and one or two others. The idea was that that white map would become black. That was 20 years ago. Mr. President, in the past 20 years, 15 of which I have been in this Senate, I have seen how one after the other countries have fallen to Black domination. Rhodesia already has a Black government and South West Africa has a Black majority government, even if it is a temporary government. Only South Africa has a White Government. The question is: Can we survive? Just as the past 20 years has decided the future of the whole of Africa so the next 20 years will decide whether there is a place anywhere in Africa for the White man, a place where he can remain, a place where he can govern himself and where he will fit into the greater context in which he finds himself on this Black continent. That is where the policy of the NP comes in, Sir.</p>
<p>One of the reasons the international world wants to destroy us is because of international money power. The idea behind it is a unitary state in the world with a unitary government. At the moment UN is trying to bring about that unitary government That is their eventual aim. The reason why they are so opposed to South Africa is because we are not in favour of a unitary state; we are in favour of a multinational State. We acknowledge the diversity of nations. The international community wants to eliminate the diversity of nations so that they can promote their trade and can act in a world that has only one government. Europe is getting one government and UN is the other government. Russia wants to dominate the whole world. As Whites we see our way clear to live here under certain conditions. The first condition on which we can live somewhere in Africa, viz. here in South Africa, is that we must have an area where the White man can maintain his technology and his knowledge, his sovereignty and independence and where he can have a platform from which he can co-operate with the other nations of Africa and Southern Africa. That is the crux of the policy of the NP and that is the only policy which can assure us of a future as Whites. It makes no difference what party we belong to. When the day comes they will not ask who is a member of the NRP or who is a PFP member or who is an independent. They will ask who is White.</p>
<p>If we have an area in Africa over which we have sovereignty and where we have developed our own infrastructure, this cannot succeed. That was tried in the other colonies in Africa and did not work. That is the only way we can survive. That in short is our policy, but there are certain conditions attached to this. We as a White community will only be able to maintain ourselves in this South African part of the continent on certain conditions. The most important condition is that we must prove that we are responsible for the welfare of the non-Whites, not to oppress them but to help them. We have already shown this. We have the facts.</p>
<p>Here is the book which Dr. Jan Marais published. In this he draws a comparison between ourselves and the rest of Africa. He shows here what we do for the non-Whites. We do more for the non-Whites than the United Party and the hon. Senator Webber did over the years. [Interjections.] It is here that we must bring home to the non-Whites inside the Republic through our new information service, that they cannot continue to live in prosperity and enjoy their homes, wages and health services without the help of the White man. Senator Webber who complains about apartheid, does not understand this. He understands the caricature of apartheid and he is a product of the caricature of apartheid. Apartheid is not oppression. The NP concept of apartheid is multi-national development. That is what we are creating. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The Government is showing by the action it is taking that it is prepared to do this. Once we have brought the homelands to independence and we can co-operate with them, we can spread our wings to co-operate with the rest of the states of Southern Africa. This is no new policy, Sir. This was the policy of Dr. Verwoerd. I was at the NP congress in Pretoria in 1959 when Dr. Verwoerd made his first speech that evening as Prime Minister of South Africa. I went to hear his views and his view was that we should follow the pattern of the British Commonwealth of Nations. That Commonwealth consisted of different nations, each retaining its own sovereignty but acting together as a unit. It is that pattern of the British Commonwealth of Nations that we have in mind for Southern Africa. The foundation has been laid. We are now helping Mozambique with its railways. If Mozambique wants to attack us, they can attack us from Mozambique, but they will not do so because it will harm their economy. We built the capital of Malawi; we transport Zambia&#x2019;s copper. I predict that the time will come when Angola will approach us in connection with water supplies and the technological development of their country because the Cubans cannot develop their country. We do business with the Congo, whether they admit it or not. I know that we do a great deal of trade with the Congo. We have the framework of co-operation but it is people like the hon.

<p>He does not make many speeches in this Chamber, worse luck, because I enjoy his speeches. They are always good for a smile and a laugh. However, I think his attitude and his defence of Nationalist Party policy was not the same policy that the hon. Senator Carr was referring to or which the hon. Senator Koch was referring to a little earlier. They were for instance shouting at the hon. Senator Webber whether he was going to talk apartheid policy at the South Coast election. They were getting quite agitated about it. I understood that that party had abandoned the apartheid policy. The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Pik Botha, is not prepared to &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. President, I hope the hon. Senator Carr will go to the South Coast. It probably is the main function which he fulfils in that party and I think it is time he was accompanied by the hon. Senator Koch. They can then explain their policy down at the South Coast. However, I am most intrigued to know just what is the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy because that coming from the hon. Senator Dr. Loock is certainly not the same as that coming from other hon. Senators on the other side. They seem to have abandoned it from day to day. Or perhaps the hon.

<p>And your problems?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>We have our problems and I certainly will not dodge the problems that we have. The greatest problem that we have in South Africa is that for 30 years that party has been indoctrinating an electorate to accept a certain code which is going to be very difficult to change. They are going to find it harder than anybody else to change. That in fact is what happened at Randfontein. This is the problem of Randfontein. For 30 years they say one thing and then they come along and try to tell the people something else and find that they will not swallow it at Randfontein or anywhere else for that matter.</p>
<p>When we deal with the labour legislation that is coming forth within the next few days, I am going to talk about this particular aspect at much greater length, because I believe that this is one of the harms done to South Africa by those hon. members on the other side of the House.</p>
<p>I now want to come back to the hon. the Minister of Finance and say that South Africa has had a bad year, probably the worst year it has had in 20 or 30 years. Unfortunately, what is bad for South Africa is also bad for the Government of South Africa and for the people of South Africa, because they govern the country. Therefore, the mistakes that they make the people of South Africa are having to pay for. Mr. President, I don&#x2019;t intend to talk finance with the hon. the Minister this afternoon because there are other things that I believe need discussing at this late stage of the session. We have had the Information scandal. [Interjections.] I know that the hon. Senators on the other side and the hon. the Minister in particular would like to see the end of this particular scandal, and I agree with them.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, it bores me stiff. I am tired of the Information scandal. But it cannot end because there is still so much that has not been cleared up. The slate has not been wiped clean. And if hon. Ministers complain because the Opposition or a person like myself raises this matter at this stage, they must blame their own ranks because who brought the Information scandal to life in the last few weeks? None other than Dr. Connie Mulder and the former State President. No sooner has this scandal died down when somebody on the Nationalist side brings something new to light and the whole controversy is started all over again. Hon. Senators need not shrug their shoulders. If they want to kill off or wipe out the Information scandal then they had better see that we hear everything that there is to know about it so that we can get on with more important matters.</p>

<p>I am going to deal with some of those things right now. Mr. President, I do not want to leave any doubt in hon. Senators&#x2019; minds. I want to say that I am totally and completely unimpressed by the latest report of the Erasmus Commission. I was unimpressed by the first report, also by the second report which I thought was a farce, together with Gen. Van den Bergh, and I am even less impressed with the report that we have just had tabled.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. J. H. LOOCK</person>:</from>
<p>Why?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>I will tell the hon. Senator why. And I hope the hon. Senator Dr. Loock will now have the political courage to agree with some of the things I am going to say. The Erasmus Commission&#x2019;s latest report is noted probably for the things it did not say rather than the things it did. There is a great deal that it seems to have left completely in the air. The commissioners have now gone back to their various jobs but in my view at no time in South Africa&#x2019;s history has a commission&#x2019;s report been so incomplete, left so many questions unanswered as this particular report. And I would also venture to say that the Erasmus Commission&#x2019;s report said a lot of things that need not have been said. For instance, it said things about people&#x2019;s private lives that I believe had nothing to do with the matter under investigation. But I want in fact to tax the hon. Senators&#x2019; opposite own particular loyalties in this regard, because when one looks at the first report of the Erasmus Commission one finds that it exonerated the former Prime Minister, later the State President. It exonerated him from any blame and completely cleared his name and his integrity. The final report of the Erasmus Commission blames the former Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster. It lays the blame squarely at his door, and yet not one shred of new evidence was produced from the time when the first report was published, which exonerated him, to the time when the final report was published which blames him. Not one shred of evidence was produced to change that finding. I want to challenge the few friends that I might have on the other side and also those who are not so friendly disposed towards me. I want to challenge every hon. Senator sitting on the other side to show me what they have done to defend their former colleague in the Cabinet. In fact, I feel ashamed, Sir, of politics in South Africa today. In the last few months two people who had reached high office in this country, Dr. Connie Mulder and the former Prime Minister and State President, Mr. Vorster, have been given all the blame for the Information scandal. Mr. Vorster served this country well under difficult circumstances, and I say this although I have no love for Mr. Vorster or his policies. Indeed, I opposed them completely. But I admired the way in which he tried to do his job. However, I opposed him openly, Mr. President. These hon. Senators supported him openly, and sometimes they became very emotional about it, but not one of them has had the courage to get up and say what they think about the treatment meted out to Mr. Vorster in this last report of the Erasmus Commission. [Interjections.] I believe that the attitude of hon. Senators opposite probably gives politics in South Africa a nasty overtone, a nasty name, because they do not have the courage to get up and defend their former colleague, and a colleague, as I have said, who according to the first report was found to be completely innocent of any wrongdoing, and yet was found guilty in the third report although no new evidence had been produced. [Interjections.] That hon. Senator is an attorney and should know better than I do &#x2026;</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>What sort of comment is that from the hon. Senator opposite?</p>
<p>This is certainly one aspect that has disturbed me very deeply, and it brings me to the next point. It seems to me that all the reports of the Erasmus Commission have at no stage implied that the people concerned, these two gentlemen I have mentioned, had enriched or benefited themselves in any way. I don&#x2019;t think that anybody has made that suggestion at any stage. That does not come into it. But, Sir, they are paying the price for their wrongdoings or for allowing things to happen or for covering up things that did happen.</p>
<p>However, I want now to put this question to the hon. the Minister of Finance. I have not dealt with him in regard to this report and I do not intend to deal with his role as stated in these reports. But I want to ask him something a tittle different in regard to this report. Does the hon. the Minister of Finance accept joint Cabinet responsibility? The hon. the Minister knows exactly what I mean by that, and what is meant by that right through the world in democratic societies. In any other democracy in the world, what has happened here in South Africa would have brought about the resignation of the government.</p>
<p>It would have brought about the resignation of people completely innocent of any knowledge of wrongdoing in the Government as well. We had the most senior and probably the best western leader in the world resign as Chancellor of West Germany, Willie Brandt, because they found a spy on his staff. Willie Brandt had nothing to do with the spy on his staff, but he felt compelled to resign. Members of Cabinets in other countries have also resigned because they felt duty bound to resign under circumstances similar to these. But in this country they go on regardless of what has been said. Here the Prime Minister and a senior Cabinet Minister, if not the most senior Cabinet Minister, are forced out of office because of something that took place, but nobody else in the Cabinet takes responsibility or offers his resignation. I believe that is a bad mark against democracy and the democratic system in South Africa. I am not questioning the role of the hon. the Minister of Finance as set out in these reports, but I want to ask him as a member of the Cabinet at the time whether he believes in joint Cabinet responsibility. If he does not, where are we going in South Africa? What responsibility does the executive accept?</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President there would be no argument if they agreed with me. What I am saying to the hon. the Minister of Finance, is that I believe he is duty bound to accept joint responsibility in this regard. I believe there is no other way of doing it in a democratic society.</p>
<p>I wish to express one final thought on the report of the Erasmus Commission. I do not expect the hon. the Minister to reply to it because he did not compile the report. Dr. Connie Mulder put this very well in <i>The Citizen.</i> Why was the purchase of <i>The Citizen</i> with State money condemned and yet the purchase of <i>To The Point</i> was not condemned? Dr. Mulder suggests that there can be no explanation for this. The two issues are identical. The newspaper was a daily financed by the Government out of public funds, while <i>To The Point</i> was a weekly supported by the Government out of public funds. That is the only difference between them. But the commission decided that <i>The Citizen</i> was improper, but that <i>To The Point</i> was perfectly in order. How can the ordinary man in the street then be expected to accept the commission&#x2019;s findings? They certainly do not make any sense.</p>
<p>I believe that the Government has had a bad year for other reasons. Not many weeks ago people in South Africa and our friends outside South Africa &#x2026;</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>A few weeks ago people in South Africa and our friends outside South Africa were greatly encouraged by the publication of the reports of the Riekert en Wiehahn Commissions. A good many complimentary things were said about South Africa in regard to these two reports and a great deal of hope was engendered by them among South Africans and among our friends overseas. But what happened? After receiving these two reports, the Government hesitantly published a White Paper in which it seemed to accept most of the recommendations. But then suddenly there were conferences and differences of opinion with people like Paulus, and then we had the Randfontein by-election. The moment that happened, the Government ducked out of carrying out the recommendations as contained in these two reports because of its abject fear.</p>
<p>That is why I say again that the Government lacks the courage to carry out bold policies, and it is only bold policies which will get us out and keep us out of trouble. You see, Sir, when it comes to formulating a policy which conflicts with their race philosophy, then that policy becomes stone dead, and the hon. Senators on the other side must know it. I wonder how much power the hon. the Minister has as a senior member of the Cabinet to implement policy which is in contradiction to the Nationalist philosophy. I do not believe he would have any power at all. He might also find himself on the outside looking in if he tried to implement such a policy.</p>
<p>These two reports which gave so much encouragement to the average South African have become nothing more than a damp squib, a wet sponge, a slap in the face, because the Government has failed to tackle the problems facing us. More than this, though, Sir, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that South Africa also had a bad year, because democracy died more in this session which is now coming to an end, than in any other session since 1910. Democracy sustained severe wounds during the last few weeks of this session. More restrictions are being placed on the press. In the last days we have had &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, Mr. President, if you will forgive me, there have already been five Bills passed through this House which restricted the Press, and I am not including those still to come. I say that in this session we have again damaged democracy. We have had the statements by the Commissioner of Police as reported in the press yesterday warning policemen not to complain publicly to the Press about their poor conditions of pay. [Interjections.] The police have been told not to complain about their poor conditions. Who must they complain to? Who is going to listen to them? [Interjections.] The hon. Senator does not understand. I am saying this is democracy which is continually being undermined, and democracy suffered more in this session than it has suffered since 1910. If we go on like this, within a couple of years there will be no democracy in South Africa. We will have truly joined all the other African states, the banana republics which we are beginning to ape in almost everything we do and say.</p>
<p>This is why I am concerned about this session which is now coming to an end. I have sat in this Chamber and in the Other Place for a total of something like 14 sessions, and I have never known one where more controls, more restrictions have been slowly placed on the Statute Book. This is the sort of thing that is going on. [Interjections.] Hon. Senators opposite talk about the dangers to South Africa, the dangers implied in certain suggestions which have been made. But, Sir, there is no greater danger to South Africa than the attitude of the hon. Senators opposite. The hon. Senator Dr. Loock spoke of the White man&#x2019;s place on the Southern continent. The White man will have no place anywhere in Africa if the attitude of the NP is allowed to continue. They do not seem to have learned the lesson of South West Africa. Only this week South West Africa dealt with a Bill to scrap apartheid and race discrimination. South West Africa has been akin to us for so many years, and this week it took the bold step because it knew there was no other course. Our friends, our kith and kin in Rhodesia have done the same. If we do not start to look at our problems, we will not escape the Rhodesian situation or the South West African situation.

We can condemn the outside world, we can condemn the United Nations&#x2014;I believe justly so&#x2014;but then we give them ammunition because we practise double standards all the time. Sir, if we want to preserve ourselves in South Africa we have to start looking at the role that we are playing. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. President, I do not know whether the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat makes these outlandish statements just to attract the attention of the Press or the world outside. Some of the things he says are extremely irresponsible and they indicate an extreme lack of knowledge of the subject on which he professes to be speaking. I shall refer to only a few of them because I have not much time at my disposal. I want to say to that hon. Senator that his view of the international situation of South Africa is so narrow that we on this side of the House gain the impression that all he reads is the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, instead of broadening his knowledge by reading <i>To The Point</i> as well.</p>
<p>That hon. Senator made a comparison which I want to put right. He said that <i>The Citizen</i> and <i>To The Point</i> were identical as far as the Government&#x2019;s involvement was concerned. I want to say immediately that that hon. Senator is either terribly illinformed or quite unable to grasp what the difference is.</p>

<p>Reports indicate that <i>The Citizen</i> was financed through secret funds and that this was not the right course. The Government has done everything in its power to put that in its right perspective. In the other instance, the Government recognized that in some way it had aided another magazine which was a nonpolitical party magazine and which was putting the case of South Africa&#x2014;which unfortunately sometimes includes that hon. Senator as well&#x2014;and defending this country against some of the most heinous lies that are told in the world about South Africa. The sooner that hon. Senator learns to appreciate that he is part of South Africa, that what we are doing in South Africa today is to defend ourselves against a very unfair situation in the world and that we need to defend ourselves, the sooner will he be happier in the political atmosphere in which he finds himself.</p>

Senator who is not a member of his party but who also sits on that side of the House, namely, the hon. Senator Webber realize that they are harming South Africa, the better it will be for them to tone down the kind of attack they make on this Government because there is no Government in the world today that can raise its head as high as the South African Government and say: &#x201C;This is what we have done for the other Coloured people with whom we are associated.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I want to deal with a point made by the hon. Senator Webber. That hon. Senator started to speak about the prices that we have to pay in this country for oil. He spoke with a great deal of authority but I am afraid that his authoritative sources must have been sucked out of his thumb because what he said was utter rubbish. I have never heard such trash in my life, Sir. He said two things. Firstly, he said that we are paying 300% more than any other country for our oil and secondly, he said that the reason why we were paying more was because we practise apartheid.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">

<p>You know that is not true.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#poorter">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>There is absolutely no truth in either of those two statements. [Interjections.] The factual situation is that the world is not 5% short of oil but only something like 3,9%. America has, in fact, done a great deal to secure her oil supplies amidst the shortage that exists in the world today. But because of her financial might and because of her economic pull, she has been able to do some things which have also been condemned by Western Europe. To try to isolate South Africa as if she were the scapegoat of some kind of world plot and to try to isolate us as if we were doing a government to government trade in the purchasing of oil, is to show the misinformation which that hon. Senator must carry around with him. We do not buy at government to government level. We have international companies operating within this country who secure the oil for this country through the normal channels through which they have secured that oil in the years gone by. Because of certain problems winch have arisen in Iran, they do experience difficulty in buying market crude.</p>
<p>If that hon. Senator knows anything about oil he will realize that marker crude is a certain kind of crude mix and that certain kind of crude mix sometimes becomes unavailable because it comes from a certain Arabian country and it is called by another name, namely &#x201C;Arabian light&#x201D;. For that reason, when we get a heavy crude into this country we do experience certain shortages within certain spectrums of what comes out of a barrel of oil. That is the truth of the matter, Sir.</p>
<p>It is quite true that when shortages arise people have recourse to the spot market. The fact that spot market prices are high is because the oil there is bid for by the world. And they do not say: &#x201C;Who is that bidding? We are going to make the price to you 40 dollars,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Who is that bidding? We are going to make the price to you 20 dollars.&#x201D; It is bid for on the open market. To suggest that South Africa has to pay a premium price because it is practising apartheid is a heinous lie and I refute it.</p>
<p>I want to ask that hon. Senator, if he has more information than I have on that subject whether he will please produce it because then at least he will be producing something in the interests of South Africa. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I want to say a few things to the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat. He said the National Party was in fact identifying itself as if it were South Africa. To a very large extent that is the truth. We in the National Party do identify ourselves as South Africans. That hon. Senator and the members of his party because of their behaviour and because of what they say identify themselves very often as being people who are not South Africans in their outlook.</p>
<p>Under the worst possible political circumstances we fought an election in Randfontein. What position could have been worse for a party than the circumstances under which we had to go to Randfontein to fight the election? What could have been worse? After a scandal which included a lot of unsubstantiated remarks on the part of a lot of people, including those hon. Senators, we had to fight that election. Despite the fact that the report was released before the election took place, despite everything, that party whom that hon. Senator represents bit the dust, to put it lightly. Their candidate lost his deposit.</p>

<p>That is a clear indication to that hon. Senator and members of his party and to other hon.

Whether their leader &#x2019;phones America three or four times a week it will not help them in the elections that take place within the borders of South Africa. That is the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>I want to mention something about somebody who has left this country because I want to come back to <i>To The Point.</i> I want to talk about a certain Dr. Jusson. I am afraid that certain people are getting the wrong impression about a man who was a very successful industrialist. He was a very successful publisher in Holland and that man decided eight years ago that South Africa was getting a raw deal in the world. He said to himself: &#x201C;I do not believe everything that I hear about South Africa.&#x201D; He obtained certain information via the wide publishing contacts he had in the world. This is a man who should not be underrated. He is a personal friend of possibly a future President of the United States. He has very influential contacts, and yet certain newspapers in this country have maligned him by insinuating that he is a bad person. And that is a bad characteristic of some newspapers. Without saying it outright, they insinuate that a man&#x2019;s character is in fact open to question. I have never met this person in the company of my brother. I have met him socially with others and I must admit that I was ashamed to see him and his wife leaving South Africa in tears. They came to South Africa with the intention of doing something for this country, and what happened? They left here feeling disgraced, like criminals, all because they believed in what South Africa was trying to do. In their eyes it was right.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the Erasmus report about him. Do not show your ignorance any further.</p>
<p>For some time now I have wanted to put it on record that I was aggrieved as a South African to see the treatment meted out to these people by some newspapers. How many more people in the outside world who are friendily disposed towards our country and want to assist us will not be frightened away by such treatment? Those two hon. Senators who make so many Interjections when one attacks them because they feel so guilty, should ask themselves whether they are in fact serving a purpose in the political situation in South Africa. Are they in fact serving this country and contributing towards its welfare because at this moment in time we need people who can contribute towards the welfare of South Africa. We are South Africans and have no other place to go to. We want the best for everybody in this country.</p>
<p>Those hon. Senators try to create the impression that apartheid is some kind of oppressive measure. They make it out to be something that is intended to separate and keep nations apart, as if we were building fences between cattle. That, however, is a heinous lie because the Government has stated repeatedly what it is trying to do by means of apartheid. With the co-operation of all the national groups the Government is trying to bring about self-expression for these nations. It is trying to establish nations in South Africa without bloodshed. But when independence is achieved by a state in South Africa it is not recognized by the United Nations who then have something else to rant about. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>That hon. Senator should ask himself whether he is on the right track because his idea of apartheid is vastly different to that held by this side of the House. I do not know whether he ever listens to what is said by this side of the House or whether he ever reads a magazine or anything else that sets out intelligently the aims and objects of apartheid. If he did he certainly would not behave in this manner. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. President, I was in a very privileged position because I was in fact the chairman of an investigating committee. Despite the fact that a few inducements were held out to me&#x2014;in other words, I was promised a certain job should I decide to join a certain party&#x2014;and despite the fact that on the Saturday I had to decide which party I should join on the following Monday, I still decided to join the NP. This should indicate to the hon. Senator that there must have been a very strong conviction on my part that dissuaded me from accepting the inducements and prompted me to join the NP. I did this because of my firm conviction that this is the only party which in fact can do the job that lies ahead for South Africa. Despite the fact that we have had to walk a rough road and have had to surmount a few obstacles, I am still convinced that the path ahead for South Africa will be safe in the hands of the National Party. I have absolutely no confidence in the direction in which the hon. Senator Winchester or the hon. Senator Webber is going. I am sorry that when they make a speech they cannot do so in the same moderate terms as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this House. When he speaks about the fuel problem or any other problem he does so with a certain amount of responsibility, but I am afraid that the two hon. Senators whom I have mentioned do not follow his example.</p>
<p>I want to mention one other thing to the hon. Leader of the Opposition because I think be referred in a responsible way to the rise in the price of fuel. Nobody in South Africa does not regret the rise in the price of fuel. Of course the price of fuel has gone up, but South Africa is only one of many countries where this has happened. First of all, therefore, let us be assured that we are not out of step with the rest of the world in that regard.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>The price here is one of the highest in the world.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#poorter">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>Secondly, what are we using the money for that we are obtaining from the levy on the price of fuel? We are not using this money in an irresponsible way. We are using this money to swell a fund and to establish the means which will enable us to procure supplies of fuel in the future. There are also certain advantages in the escalating price of fuel, and I do not want anybody, especially the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, to underestimate the influence of an increase in the price of fuel.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of price predictions in the world. One has what we call a medium price prediction and a high price prediction. When one refers to a medium price prediction, one is referring to the amount of energy that one can get out of the ground, because it is covered by a type of price umbrella. If one gives it a higher price prediction, one has a greater recovery potential In the one case it is considered that if one has a medium price prediction, one can only get 75% of the energy out of the earth. If one has a high price prediction, one can get nearly 100% energy out of the earth. It is therefore understandable that when we increase the price of petrol in South Africa, we extend the possibility of developing energy from other sources over a very wide range in South Africa. If we want to survive the year 2020 it is absolutely essential that we should start planning now for our future energy requirements.</p>
<p>In the short time at my disposal I would like to give hon. Senators just a hint of the type of development we will have to undertake. I would like to relate the amount of solar energy that we will have to extract in the next 45 years to the amount of electricity we are using today. I want to say that the amount of electricity that we are using today will have to be derived from solar energy within the next 45 years in order to keep up with development. I say this because energy is as closely linked to the development of a country and its economy as a baby is linked to milk. It is absolutely essential that we relate the energy requirements of our country to those of our economic expansion.</p>
<p>It is no secret to anybody that economically we have to expand in a big way in the future, and that expansion will depend on the amount of energy we will be able to obtain from the earth. Fortunately for South Africa we have a great deal of energy potential under the earths crust, and I know that under the direction of this hon. Minister of Finance we will utilize it fully. I want to commend the hon. the Minister, Sir, because under difficult circumstances he has ensured that South Africa has come out on top. Even the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged that we have money in this country. The hon. Senator Webber also said that we have plenty of money. But we do not have plenty of money in this country by accident. We have it because of the thorough planning and through the conviction of a Minister of Finance who knows what he is doing, who sees his policies through, who, irrespective of the political consequences, says &#x201C;This is the best for this country&#x201D;&#x2014;not the best for the NP&#x2014;and in fact sees that this policy is carried out. And that hon. Senator can still drive a motor-car, can still be happy and sleep well at night because he has an hon. Minister of Finance who looks after his interests as well.</p>

<p>Mr. President, before the debate was adjourned yesterday, the hon. Senator Dr. Loock had given us a long story and had said that he was the core of the Nationalist Party. When my car starts overheating I look at the cooling system. I usually find that the radiator is at fault and I recore it. I suggest it is time that the Nationalist Party had a recore. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Poorter dealt with certain matters and raised the question why the Press and the hon. Senator Winchester had likened <i>To The Point</i> to <i>The Citizen.</i> The hon. Senator Winchester said both were wrong and he wanted to know the reason why. It is quite clear that both these publications were handled by the company known as South Africa Today. They had common directors, etc. Let us be frank and admit that both of them were financed from secret funds, one to the tune of about R32 million and the other to the tune of about R14 million. As far as I am concerned they can therefore be put into the same category.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Poorter also questioned the loyalty of members of the Opposition to South Africa. I want to say that many members on the Opposition benches showed their loyalty during 1939 to 1945, and I question where some of the members sitting opposite were at that stage. I do not think the hon. Senator should cast aspersions in this regard.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Poorter also questioned the statement made by my colleague, the hon. Senator Webber, that we were paying 300% more for oil. I think there was a misunderstanding on the part of the hon. Senator Poorter because what my colleague sought to convey was that the price of oil in South Africa to the motorist has gone up by approximately 300% and not that we were paying 300% more for our oil. What the hon. Senator Webber did say was that South Africa was having to pay approximately twice the OPEC price because we were having to buy on the spot market. [Interjections.] I will answer that, the hon. Senator must just be patient. He said that the reason why we were paying twice the OPEC price was because of apartheid. Let us analyse this statement. Because of its policies, South Africa has been made either the scapegoat or the polecat of the world&#x2014;call it what you will. We have been barred from the sportsfields and from all sorts of international consultative bodies and we are having to pay premium prices for our oil.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#poorter">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>Can you prove it?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#bozas">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:</from>
<p>Of course I can prove it. To suggest otherwise is merely trying to evade the issue. Let us face facts. We are being castigated and boycotted by the Arab nations as far as the supply of oil is concerned, so there can be no question about it. [Interjections.] If the hon. Senator says &#x201C;Rubbish&#x201D; I suggest that he finds himself a bin and throws himself into it!</p>
<p>The hon. Senator said: &#x201C;We in the National Party do identify ourselves as South Africans.&#x201D; I have said before and I say again that where hon. Senators opposite make a mistake is that they refer to the national interest when they mean the Nationalist interest. The sooner they change that, the better.</p>
<p>As far as Dr. Jussen is concerned, it is with regret that I have to say that it is because of his association with the company known as South Africa Today that he has been criticized and castigated by the Press and other people. I think he is a true friend of South Africa, but having become involved with secret funds and secret organizations, the odium has stuck and I am afraid it is going to take a long time for him to live it down.</p>
<p>I think it is quite clear that the problems in South Africa today revolve around two crises, viz. an energy crisis and a crisis of confidence. I will deal with these in the course of my speech.</p>
<p>I think that we must accept that we have an energy crisis. We all admit it and we have analysed the reasons for it. It is going to be difficult to overcome this oil shortage. After all, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has told us that we are having to pay more than 200% more than the OPEC price for our oil on the spot market. This fact has been denied by the hon. Senator Poorter. Be that as it may, I think the hon. Senator Poorter has made valuable contributions on a few occasions to debates of this nature in that he has pointed out the various reasons why one cannot get more than a certain amount of diesel out of a barrel of oil. He also indicated the need to convert to solar energy. I have pleaded with the hon. the Minister before and I plead with him again that in order to help overcome the energy crisis, low cost loans or some type of subsidy should be made available to enable big consumers of energy to convert to electricity or solar heating or both. This is an important aspect.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that in terms of Government policy non-Whites are housed very far from their places of employment. We find the Blacks living far out and generally speaking the Coloured people and the Indian people living far away from the industrial areas or the commercial areas in the towns which are their places of employment. That being the case, they have no option but to use public transport or they use their own transport, because they are usually too far away to walk to their place of employment and I therefore plead for sympathy to be shown by the Government in regard to the costs incurred by these people in getting to and from work.</p>
<p>The transport subsidies paid up to now are nowhere near adequate because the passenger bus services are already labouring under the increases announced just over a month ago, and since then we have had the increase of 15 cents per litre&#x2014;post Randfontein. There is this problem, Sir, and I would like to appeal once again to the hon. the Minister to see what he can do about an increase in the transport subsidy.</p>
<p>I also want to deal very briefly with the question of the plight of the farmers. Earlier this session I referred to the difficulties facing the farmers. These difficulties have been compounded by the terrific increases in the price of fuel that have hit the country over the past few months. Our costs of production have increased alarmingly and I want to pay tribute to the hon. Senator Oelrich, the hon. Senator Dr. Visser and the hon. Senator Webber who underlined the problems of the farming community.</p>
<p>I must appeal to the hon. the Minister to take a realistic view of this and go to his Cabinet colleagues and tell them that the time when they expected to be able to keep the farmer a pauper is past. We have now got to pay the farmer a realistic price for his produce &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and not make him a candidate for the bankruptcy court every year. The days of cheap food, I am afraid, are over, because so many of the inputs of the farming community are heavily taxed. I want to ask hon. Senators to go out and tell the people that there is no such thing as a subsidy for a farmer. The Government is not subsidizing the farmer, Sir, not by any means; they are subsidizing the consumer in an indirect way.</p>
<p>I say let us rather pay the farmer the price for his produce and subsidize the consumer. Let us not call them farming subsidies because they are not farmers&#x2019; subsidies by any manner or means.</p>

<p>They are food subsidies to the consumer. The farming community are the backbone of this country. If they are taken away we will collapse, because if we cannot feed the people we can never develop economically or commercially or in any other way.</p>
<p>Having said that, Sir, I would say that the one problem facing us is that of inflation. It is running away again, partly through no fault of our own, but, Sir, the one way to fight inflation is to increase productivity. That does not necessarily mean we must work harder but it means we must work more objectively; we must work with our brains and not with our brawn. I think that the concessions that have been made in the budget in respect of reductions in income tax should go a long way towards encouraging people to work harder. But it is necessary for us to impress on the people that the country as a whole must help in the fight against inflation. If they all come forward and we have better productivity, then we will be able to lay the inflation ghost which has hindered us for so many years.</p>
<p>But here the industrialist, the entrepreneur, is still concerned about the long-term aspects. His confidence in the short-term has been revived but he is still rather concerned from the long-term view because he does not know to what extent we are prepared to accept in full the recommendations of the Riekert and Wiehahn Commissions. We have before us amendments to the Industrial Conciliation Act but as far as entrepreneurs are concerned they do not go far enough. The legislation before us certainly does not go as far as the White Paper led us to believe it would go. There is this crisis of confidence among the industrial community as to whether we are going to go far enough or whether we are going to let the right wing of the NP rule the country and so forestall any attempt at progress in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I think you will agree with me that in the course of the debate which has taken up no more than a single day of the Senate&#x2019;s time, we have had a number of not only interesting but important contributions from both sides of the House.

<p>I want to refer to some aspects of the debate. Obviously I cannot refer to all. If I do not get round to dealing with all the hon. Senators who have advanced arguments and aired points of view which really deserve comment, I trust they will forgive me.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Bozas&#x2014;to start with the last speaker&#x2014;is more convincing when he talks on economics and finance than when he talks on party politics, if I may say so in the nicest way. He referred to the statement by the hon. Senator Webber to the effect that South Africa is paying these unduly high prices for oil today because of the policy of apartheid. Now, Sir, let us be quite clear. It is not because of the policy of apartheid or separate development, as I much prefer to call it, that this position has arisen. It is no doubt perhaps to some extent due to the fact that this side of the House and the Government have refused to hand over our birth-right to the Marxists and the terrorists.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to get into any political arguments but I put that with respect to the hon. Senator Bozas. Perhaps on another occasion, if there is such an occasion, he might like to come back to that particular point that he raised in his speech. But I leave it at. that The fact of the matter is that we are having to pay very high prices for oil. It is true that the whole world is paying substantially more for oil. Not all countries are paying the same price, obviously, but I doubt if there is any country worth mentioning today that is not being very detrimentally affected by this very serious problem, namely the so-called hike in liquid fuel prices. It is an extremely serious matter. As I tried to say in my speech yesterday, I believe that we have at least tried to put ourselves in the position of having a basically strong economy to withstand these slings and arrows of outrageous fortune because of our basic financial strength. Let us make it perfectly clear, the Government cannot take all the credit for that position. We have had a very substantial increase in the price of gold and that is something which has also benefited us substantially.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, a feature of this debate, and quite rightly so, has been the emphasis on our farming industry, agriculture, and the problems which without doubt they have encountered recently.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Oelrich made a positive contribution in this regard. I agree with him. Broadly speaking his approach is quite right.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser in my view made a very convincing speech, mostly in connection with problems in the sphere of agriculture.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Webber also referred to this, as did other hon. Senators. I think right at the end the hon. Senator Bozas also referred to it briefly.</p>
<p>If I understood the hon. Senator Oelrich correctly, he made the statement, <i>inter alia</i>, that we must seriously consider paying food subsidies out of gold profits&#x2014;to make subsidies on fuel or petrol available for the food industry.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Decidedly not. I think if one considers and analyses the recent budget and the steps which are now under consideration&#x2014;-and not only in the latest budget but in fact the last few budgets&#x2014;one sees very clearly that this Government adopts a very definite attitude towards the farming community. Once again I want to stress that my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, and I set up a working committee earlier this year. In my view it is a very effective committee although it has not been active very long. The committee is under the chairmanship of Dr. Jacobs, the General Manager of the Reserve Bank, and is a very representative body consisting of representatives of the agricultural industry, the co-operatives, the Land Bank itself, the Reserve Bank, Finance, Treasury and so on. That committee has already given us a report and we took immediate steps in the light of that first report to provide a measure of relief. The Jacobs Committee is now engaged in a more penetrating and important inquiry. This is in connection with the long-term problems of the farming industry. We expect that report in the near future and we shall give preference to it. We shall also definitely try to take further steps to help the agricultural industry in the present circumstances. I mention this again. I think I have also said this on a previous occasion in this House.</p>
<p>When we talk of subsidies, we must basically and in principle be very careful. Subsidies can be justified, of course, under certain circumstances and at the moment there are subsidies which I have absolutely no intention of terminating. But I do think we must be careful in general because it is a fact that subsidies do tend to distort real costs in the economy as a whole. As we say in English, subsidies can be so disruptive of the market or price system. I should therefore just like to issue this general warning, Mr. President. We must remember that subsidies are not the ideal solution to economic problems but, where grave problems do arise, especially in sectors which have themselves not been the cause of the problems, one has sometimes to resort to extraordinary measures. I should like to point out again that we raised the bread subsidy in the budget from R50 million to R70 million. In my view this is proof of the serious view the Government takes of the situation.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Oelrich spoke of the possibility of subsidies on fuel as an alternative. In this respect I should like to warn again that we must be careful. How wise is it to introduce subsidies of this sort? Subsidies on fuel are very difficult to administer, as has also been found in other countries. Once again it is subsidies which will distort the real cost of food. That is one of the problems which it will create and, of course, the rich as well as the poor will benefit.</p>
<p>The additional gold mining revenue as a result of the higher gold price has at this stage largely been earmarked to meet unavoidable increases in expenditure. Certain important increases only became effective after the budget, in the short period from 31 March. One thinks of Sasol and again of the oil problem, which means that we have had to take a lot more money out of the Treasury than we planned for two months ago.</p>
<p>I am merely mentioning these aspects, but it makes no difference to my general approach that there are definitely problems in the agricultural sector.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I realize it full well, Sir, because I come up against it daily and also through representations addressed to me. In co-operation with the Jacobs Committee we are trying to find really effective methods to bring about&#x2014;I shall not necessarily call them solutions but hopefully they will be solutions&#x2014;significant relief in important spheres of the agricultural industry.</p>
<p>While the hon. Senator Dr. Visser was talking about agriculture he referred to the Priorities Committee. I think he pleaded for representation of the agricultural departments on the Priorities Committee. I have nothing against that. The Priorities Committee is a fairly small technical committee on which very senior officials serve under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Finance, as I said yesterday. Provision has also been made for that committee to co-opt members. As a result of the speech of the hon. Senator Dr. Visser this committee will probably reconsider the matter, and as far as I am concerned there is no problem as far as representation of the agricultural industry on that committee is concerned.</p>
<p>†The hon. Senator Webber made various suggestions to me in regard to concessions. He talked about the possibility of abolishing the rest of the surcharge on imports which is now 7&#x00BD;%. You may remember, Mr. President, that it was originally 15%, and was imposed as a revenue measure. We have up to now managed to have it in two phases. That is something we constantly bear in mind and I can assure the House, as I have said before, that if the state of our public finances is such that we can do without it, it is something I would personally rather welcome because it is not the sort of measure one particularly wants to see. But it certainly was important to find that revenue at the time.</p>
<p>He also pleaded for the abolition of the excise duties which have taken the place of the remaining old sales duties. Again it is, of course, a question of the needs of the fiscus where we have to meet all sorts of heavy requirements. The House knows that apart from the very substantial escalation in the cost of defence and security, there is also the need to step up the consolidation of the homelands programme. In addition, there is the very heavy commitment as a result of the big extensions to Sasol II, where we have to find R3 300 million in a matter of two or three years. There is, of course, the further problem posed by the latest very big oil price increase. All these things are extremely costly to the country and one has to bear that in mind. But by and large there is no doubt that we would like to see some of these concessions being made. I think we have made very substantial concessions this year in the budget. If we can go further under rather difficult conditions we certainly will not hesitate to do so. The hon. Senator Oelrich correctly said that if the price of gold continues as it is we ought certainly to increase the income from gold mining taxation, but I would ask the House to bear in mind that at the same time costs for the gold mining industry as for other industries are rising significantly, which affects the profitability and tax productivity of the mines. It is also true that some of these mines are looking for ways and means of developing and, as the House knows, they can write off substantial capital development costs against revenue. We must bear that in mind, because that would reduce what would otherwise be higher profits. These are some of the things we have to bear in mind when we look at this particular issue.</p>
<p>*I shall not keep the House long, but I should like to refer again to agriculture. I think that the hon. Senators Oelrich and Dr. Visser spoke very persuasively in this regard. They made certain statements and used arguments which were very interesting. I have absolutely no intention of criticizing their approach but I should like to comment on certain of the statements that have been made. This applies particularly in the case of the hon. Senator Dr. Visser because we must try to put things in perspective so that we can deal with them in a positive and constructive way and really help the farming community. I must repeat that broadly speaking we all agree that our farmers are experiencing problems. Any form of assistance which is given, especially systematic and planned assistance, must be provided against the background of the Jacobs Committee&#x2019;s report which we expect to have shortly. I am pleased that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser is here again. He may not have heard me say that I was particularly impressed with his speech. I agree with him completely when he pleaded for effective assistance for our farming community; not so much assistance but that our policy should be such that we can derive the greatest benefit from this very important sector for the whole country and population. I should, however, like to put the matter in perspective and come to certain conclusions.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser included the State&#x2019;s capital expenditure in respect of State corporations as aid to the industrial sector. Although this does indirectly assist the industrial sector, it is perhaps not quite correct to assess the position in that way. In the same way one would then have to include expenditure on dams, for instance, which are to the advantage of agriculture and are owned by the State, in agricultural expenditure. It is just a question of what they call comparing comparables.</p>
<p>Agriculture without doubt is the greatest work provider, as the hon. Senator Dr. Visser quite rightly pointed out. But I do feel it should also be pointed out that in the main it is the less skilled labour in the country that is so employed.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>That, after all, is important.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, I agree that in itself it is important, but I just want to point out that seen in that light labour utilization and productivity per labourer in the agricultural industry is probably lower than in the industrial sphere as a whole where more skilled or highly skilled labour is used. If one looks at it from that angle, one can perhaps say that the industrial sector makes a larger contribution per labourer than does agriculture. If one wants to take it further, one could possibly say that in that connection the industrial sector makes a larger contribution to the living standard of the Black man. I should not like to take this matter too far, however, because one speaks of skilled and unskilled labour and there can be circumstances in which the unskilled labour may be more productive than the skilled. What I really do want to say is that with totally different types of workers it is not really fair to express the State&#x2019;s contribution per worker as the hon. Senator has done. But I do repeat that it is a good thing the hon. Senator did so because it resulted in our taking a very close look at these things and making a very thorough analysis.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#visser">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>
<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? Would the hon. the Minister not say that if one included dams in agriculture there are also dams, such as the Vaal Dam, which can be included in the industrial sector? Regarding the capital contributions, I gave the current figures. If current expenditure is more in favour of agriculture&#x2014; that is in fact the case&#x2014;<i>in toto</i>, is one&#x2019;s conclusion not the same?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>As far as the current figures are concerned, I shall accept them, but as far as dams are concerned, there is, of course, the question of the purpose for which the dams are used. I have certain large dams in mind which were actually established for agriculture. As I have already said, I do not want to take the argument too far. I merely raise these possibilities with the idea of seeing the matter in perspective.</p>
<p>As far as the low profitability of the farming industry is concerned, this is true in many branches of the industry. But I think the problem is more involved than that. A rise in prices which will give a higher return to the farmer causes a rise in land prices immediately. Because the return in the case of the farming industry is determined by market-related agricultural land prices, the return will automatically decline again, even with an increased price.</p>
<p>I think hon. Senators will agree with me on that. It is generally conceded today, I think, that the value of agricultural land has not kept pace with its productive value, and this of course complicates the estimate of a rate of return. I think that is a major problem as far as agriculture is concerned, viz. to estimate precisely what the actual rate of return is. That is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Further, Sir, it is in fact true that the prices of the majority of agricultural products are indirectly controlled. This matter was raised during the debate. In my view price control was not introduced to prejudice the farmer but rather for his benefit. I think in any case that was the main motive. Price control gives the farmer greater price stability. If there were no price control and a control board system, the farmer&#x2019;s income would be subject to great fluctuations.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#oelrich">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:</from>
<p>It depends on the margin.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, that is so. I am sure that if we made a survey among farmers today they would vote for the retention of the existing control board system. I am speaking in general here. I just want to say that it is interesting to note that the real net farming income per farming unit from 1972 to 1978 rose by an average annual rate of 3,8%. The real income per capita for the whole population rose by approximately 1%, but the real income per White worker actually declined somewhat in that period. I think the figure is in the region of ,5%, and one could say that it has remained more or less constant. I want to repeat that I concede that adjustments will have to be made in agriculture but they must not be disruptive. They should rather enable the farmer to make a living as an entrepreneur in a free market in a capitalist country. I want to repeat: The solution, as far as I can see, does not lie in large-scale subsidies to the farmer. In this way the cost of production is disturbed and the costs are not brought home where they belong. A price adjustment of products with an accompanying food subsidy to the consumer would be more justified. I think this is where we are all in complete agreement. This method is recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, by the World Bank and has been repeated in one of its latest publications.</p>
<p>I should like to say once again that I have the greatest appreciation for the manner in which this very important aspect of our economy has been raised and dealt with in this debate. I do not want the hon. Senator Dr. Visser to feel that I am critical of his approach. That is definitely not the case. I agree with him. I am merely trying to analyse the arguments and get a balance.</p>
<p>Mr. President, when we have had the opportunity to put the studies now being made available to us to an authoritative committee whose recommendations we shall consider immediately and do the best we can, I trust that this hon. Senate will feel that the Government has once more shown how much in earnest it is in the steps it takes to stress the importance of the agricultural industry in South Africa. This is absolutely important because fundamentally, a country which cannot produce its own food today is at a great disadvantage. To put it the other way: The country that can produce its own food today has a very great advantage which it must utilize. I feel that South Africa is almost under an obligation to help its neighbouring states in Africa in the provision of food because it seems to me that they are unable to produce food on a scale sufficient to meet their own needs. I think South Africa will also derive great benefit from this for its own producers.</p>
<p>I am pleased that the debate has dealt mostly with the question of agriculture. I might just say that I myself grew up on a farm. It was not a mealie farm or a cattle farm, and so I did not have to contend with the hon. Senator Du Toit and his red meat problems. We had a wine farm.</p>

<heading>EDUCATION AND TRAINING BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-education">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Sir, the basic purpose of the Bill is to consolidate and supersede the Black Education Act, 1953, and the Black Special Education Act, 1964, and at the same time to bring the legislation into line with corresponding legislation of other departments of education. Consequently the basic objects of the superseding legislation amount to an attempt to establish the framework within which the department may meaningfully plan and extend the overall development of education for Blacks in order to meet the overall training requirements.</p>
<p>An aspect which also deserves mention is that there is and will be continuous liaison with other departments of education to ensure that the standards, on the lower levels, will be the same as is at the moment. The case on the Senior Certificate level at which the examination standards of the JMC or the Department of National Education are complied with.</p>
<p>I should like to make a few observations, Mr. President, on the Black Education Act and advance the reasons why it is deemed necessary and why I am pleased that it has now become possible for it to be superseded.</p>
<p>In the first place, the Act was basically intended to make provision for the transfer of Black education from the provinces to the central Government. This process has been completed and the Act has consequently become redundant.</p>
<p>In the second place the education which was taken over from the provinces at the time, i.e. circa 1953 was for the most part subsidized or State-aided education. Only the teachers&#x2019; training schools, the trade and technical schools and certain senior secondary schools functioned as Government schools. However, other education remained State-aided. In reality the department did have control over the standard of education and professional control over the tuition, but was dependent on other bodies when it came to the establishment and provision of the necessary facilities. I am afraid that because of that system backlogs have been built up, backlogs which we have been fortunate enough to identify. We have also made provision to catch up on these backlogs.</p>
<p>In the third place the development of the Black states has been accelerated with the result that control over education, mainly community school education, has been transferred to the governments of those States and there has been a gradual shift in the emphasis in the educational system which has remained in what is known as the White area. There are continual discussions with the departments in those particular areas without encroaching on the autonomy of those countries but with a view to greater co-ordination. In this connection I can tell hon. Senators that I myself have had discussions with the chief ministers and the ministers of education, together with senior officials of my departments and I trust that we shall continue to have such discussions regularly.</p>
<p>If there is any misunderstanding in regard to the 1953 Act dealing with Black education, I should like to remove it. I think a misunderstanding arose because it was thought that that legislation placed a ceiling on the development of the Black child which was, in fact, not the case. With the limited means at our disposal in those days it was necessary, as was stated then, to benefit the greatest number of children with the available funds. This amounted to the fact that a very large number of students left school at a very low level to the detriment not only of the child itself and its future but to the detriment of our country as a whole. I do want to say, however, Sir, that no stumbling-block was placed in the way of those children who wanted to study further and in this respect we have had regular discussions with the leaders of the Black education departments. Hon. Senators will know about the African Teachers&#x2019; Association of South Africa, ATASA, with whom we have discussed these problems regularly and whom we also consulted in connection with this particular legislation.</p>
<p>Sir, I just want to say a few words about the formulation of policy in general. In the first place, in accordance with certain provision of the National Education Policy Act of 1967 certain principles are laid down within which policy has to be formulated. I want to refer to the first one, namely clause 3(a) which provides for the Christian character of schools. This is in conformity with the relevant clauses in the Act to which I have just referred. In the second place provision is made for the observance of the accepted educationally sound principle which is accepted by the Organization of African Unity, by Unesco, other bodies and by individual States, namely, the necessity for mother-tongue education at the lower levels at least. Hon. Senators will notice that the Bill contains certain proviso&#x2019;s which stipulate prior consultation with the parents as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>A third principle is compulsory school attendance and free tuition. This has been laid down as a principle for ultimate attainment. At a later stage I shall say a few words in this connection.</p>
<p>I also want to say a few words in connection with the Council for Education and Training. That is the body we envisage which will be composed of Black people, leaders in the educational field, people who naturally will be best able to determine what the needs are of the children of the various national groups. It is anticipated that this council will form an important link at all times between the community, the educational staff and the department. Seven subcommittees of the council are to be appointed and that will mean that the Black people will have a say across a very wide front in the formation of the education policy in general.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I think it is necessary for me to say a few words in connection with community schools. I do not know whether everybody is aware of the fact that inherent in the term &#x201C;community schools&#x201D; is the concept that in the past the Black people themselves built their own schools and that those schools were more or less financed by themselves in that provision was made in a housing scheme for the erection of school buildings and that a certain portion of the rental paid by the parents was used to cover such building costs. Provision is made in this new Bill for the department to make funds available and consequently there can be general planning as regards the need for a wide range of amenities which I trust we shall soon be able to provide&#x2014;some have already been provided&#x2014; and make available to an even greater extent. Furthermore, in the past the parents used to pay an education levy and that levy was used mostly for repairing and renovating schools and buildings etc. The idea is that the parents will continue to pay this levy but I am pleased to say that it has been agreed that in future this education levy will be used in consultation with school committees and other bodies of the various schools in order to provide essential sporting facilities which, I think we all agree, are necessary for the total development of the child in his youth.</p>
<p>I think I should say a word or two about the Teachers&#x2019; Council, namely the ATASA to which I have already referred and which has on occasion expressed itself in favour of such an Educational Council but expressed a different view at a later stage. With due regard for their attitude which they maintained throughout the discussions and with due regard for the opinion of those people who were not in complete agreement, this Bill was published for comment. Provision is now made in clause 31, pursuant to those representations, that the Minister may appoint such a council. In other words, this is an enabling clause and not a mandatory clause. When the required number of people ask for it, the provision for its establishment will at least be there.</p>
<p>A word or two about compulsory school attendance. In this connection I want to make a few brief observations. Compulsory school attendance places an obligation on both parents and children. I may say that we have not yet reached the stage and that we shall most probably not reach it soon when we shall be able to make school attendance compulsory throughout the country. The reasons are obvious. In the first place, the necessary facilities are lacking and in the second place we do not have the teachers with the necessary training, especially at secondary school level. We hope to overcome this within the foreseeable future. Then we have the position also that there are thousands and thousands of school children, on the platteland of South Africa in particular, who have not even had the privilege of enjoying primary school training at the lowest primary level. In this connection, after discussions with the official representatives of the Department of Agriculture on the South African Agricultural</p>
<p>Union and the Transvaal Agricultural Union, we come to an agreement and accepted their suggestion that to an increasing extent not only primary education be offered but that provision also be made for secondary education for Black children who come from the farms. That will enable the parents to send their children to school from their homes. That will take place after proper consultation, very circumspectly and in co-operation with the farmers themselves. The idea is also&#x2014;and in this connection regulations will be promulgated at a later stage&#x2014; that the farmers, the farming community&#x2014;I want to pay tribute to them for the important role they have played in the past, often without acknowledgment, in providing educational facilities for Black children&#x2014;will be compensated in a more realistic manner, even if it is to be by way of subsidies or the hiring of buildings etc. so that they can assist in educating the children of their farm workers.</p>
<p>Provision is also being made in the Act for the establishment of nursery schools. It is not necessary for me at this stage to refer to the absolute necessity for these schools, especially in view of the countless number of Black mothers who work. This legislation provides for the establishment of nursery schools as well and I trust that we shall soon be able to start with them.</p>
<p>As far as school health services are concerned, I should like to express my gratitude to the Department of Health for already having started to provide these services. Provision is made in this legislation that the health services to be provided for Black children are to be similar to those provided for White children. I have no doubt that because of the dedication of the officials of the Department of Health and those of my own department this service will develop into something worthwhile and will be to the benefit of the children of our Black people.</p>
<p>In conclusion I just want to say that if this Bill is passed, the education of Blacks, as far as legislation is concerned&#x2014;and I emphasize this&#x2014;will be on a par with that provided by other education departments. From the nature of things an Act can make provision for something but an Act does not provide the wherewithal to make it possible. It will only be possible, therefore, to provide this through the goodwill of the people of South Africa. In this regard I include the goodwill of the Black people who should remember that it takes one match to set fire to a classroom but that that means that 40 children will be deprived of their education. It requires a large number of bricks to build one classroom and a lot of timber to put up one roof. A great deal of building work will have to be done in order to provide this necessary service for South Africa. This legislation makes it possible and I believe that this legislation heralds a new era which will be to the benefit of the Black children. And whatever is to the benefit of the Black children and the Black people is also to the benefit of the Whites and the future of South Africa.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">C. C. HENDERSON</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, after listening to the hon. the Minister delivering his introductory speech and ending up with such a note of hope and emotional fervour, really reminds me of how a father rejoices at the return of a prodigal son. To compare the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude with debates we have had in the past is almost to compare day with night. I can name just one point in particular. The hon. the Minister mentioned how many children had been educated over recent years to a very low standard of education, how few had emerged at a higher level and how this factor had adversely affected not only the Black people but the economy of South Africa as a whole. I raised that issue pertinently on many occasions with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor and I was ridiculed, not only by the hon. the Minister but by those very hon. gentlemen sitting on the opposite benches. I was ridiculed and told I knew nothing about it. I do not want to over-emphasize this aspect. We on this side of the House are only too delighted that at last the Government in the person of the hon. the Minister of Education and Training have seen the light and are now doing something about it.</p>
<p>In previous debates with this hon. the Minister where he has expressed worthy sentiments, I have also pointed out to him that expressed sentiments in themselves were of little value and that action was in fact what was necessary. This Bill at last appears to correct a wrong direction which was taken 26 years ago which has caused years of frustration, recent social upheaval and violence for which South Africa has paid a very high price over the years. This Bill would appear at last to be correcting the mistake which was made so many years ago. The tragedy is that it would appear that this Government only responds to the bludgeon. They respond to the bludgeon of blood, tears and lost treasure before they at last learn their lesson and do something statesmanlike and what we on these benches have tried to point out to them as being the correct course for so long. We on these benches are very pleased indeed that the hon. the Minister has brought this Bill before the House, this Bill which seeks to update education for Black people, a sphere which has been so sensitive in the relations between Black and White in South Africa for so long, particularly over recent years.</p>
<p>We are also very pleased to note that this Bill emerges, as it is on our desks today, as a result of consultation at all levels. It was originally published for information in the <i>Gazette</i> in November of last year. Arising from that publication many representations were made to the hon. the Minister from all sources&#x2014;from the Black people, from agriculture, from industry and from every person concerned with Black education in South Africa, which of course applies to every individual and every organization in our country. After that publication a new Bill was printed incorporating some of the recommendations arising from the original publication. Then the hon. the Minister, to his credit, submitted the Bill to a Select Committee before Second Reading, and the Bill emerged from that Select Committee again with further improvements which are embodied in the amendments incorporated in the Bill. We on this side of the House are therefore prepared to accept this Bill, not simply because we participated in a meaningful way in its formulation but particularly because the Black people participated in the formulation of this Bill in a really meaningful way. It is to be hoped now that the Black parents of South Africa will feel that they have a worthwhile educational instrument. I would support the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s appeal in this respect that all the Black children and their parents will participate and co-operate to the maximum extent possible in its implementation so that they may enjoy the full benefits which may be derived from this measure. It is quite clear in so far as the Bill itself is concerned, that the education which will emerge as a product of the Bill is equal in all respects to and in a few minor respects even better than the education which emerges as a result of Acts applying to the other population groups of South Africa. We believe that this Bill has been updated and as far as it is possible to provide in legislation, it should provide an educational system equal to any educations system for the other peoples of this land.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned various points. There is provision, for instance, for the vernacular up to Standard II and thereafter for parental choice to be introduced so that the parents may choose what medium of instruction they feel is best for their children. This we believe is correct and is a philosophy which we have propounded for a very long time indeed.</p>
<p>There is also recognition in the Bill of the desirability of compulsory general education for Black children. We on this side of the House have promoted this idea although we fully recognize the practical difficulties involved, the financial implications, the problems of providing the necessary teachers, buildings and all the other concomitant problems. These are problems to which the hon. the Minister will have to pay urgent attention if indeed he wishes to provide this compulsory education at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p>Therefore we come again to the point that it is action and not words that is required. I have stated that the Bill indicates action on the part of the hon. the Minister. It does to that extent but the Bill as such is again a compilation of words. Those words will be meaningless unless they are accompanied by adequate finance to implement the intentions provided for in the Bill. We are perfectly aware that over the years since 1953 quite inadequate sums have been provided for Black education. The proportion of the budget directed to Black education over recent years has improved materially. I notice from the current budget that an amount of R182 million has been made available which is an increase over last year of R38 million.</p>
<p>However, when one views what appears to be a very substantial sum, in relation to the problem and in relation to the number of people who have to be educated, when we have a figure almost of millions of children at school every year, then one realizes how inadequate the sum in fact is and that it is the duty of the hon. the Minister to persuade the hon. the Minister of Finance to direct very much larger sums every year to education for the Black people of this country. An increase of R38 million in one year is substantial in itself but again, related to the need, it is a very inadequate sum indeed. Accordingly I urge the hon. the Minister to accord a very much higher priority to Black education in the future and to raise the budgetary provisions annually by a very much higher percentage than has been done on this occasion. The hon. the Minister and I have both made our appeal to the Black people to participate and to co-operate and not to destroy that which is for their own benefit as unhappily has happened in the past. But an even greater duty lies upon the hon. the Minister and this Government to provide the means so that these people will believe and accept that the hon. the Minister and the Government are really sincere in their desire to provide an adequate education for them. We are aware that it is absolutely necessary to provide schools, teachers and facilities so that the Black people may be educated to take their rightful place as worthy citizens in South Africa and in their own independent states for which the Government, at this stage at any rate, has also to provide substantial sums. Not only is this necessary for the sake of the Black people themselves&#x2014;and we all recognize today that they have a right to this&#x2014;-but it is also necessary in order to enable them to make their rightful contribution to the society and economy of South Africa as a whole. I am glad that the hon. the Minister keeps nodding his head. It is very pleasant to be in accord with a Minister of Education for Black people after so many years of being at loggerheads and contradicting each other; of not even being able to talk to each other on the same level but talking past each other on every occasion.</p>

<p>Very far from it, Mr. President. I wish we were in a Utopian situation. But the change is so great that I am almost in a euphoric state. I will however come back to earth and get my feet solidly on the ground, out of the stage of relative euphoria.</p>
<p>This question of adequate education for the Black people of South Africa is of vital importance today. We have vast natural resources in the form of minerals, in the agricultural sphere and in many others, but the greatest resource of all of any nation is its human resources. We can see this everywhere. The most prosperous nations in the world today, and of the past, are those which with minimal natural physical resources have developed their human resources to the maximum. And I only have to think of Japan and Hong Kong in particular, as examples.</p>

<p>And Taiwan. Indeed, there are many such countries.</p>
<p>I have already referred to the appeal made by the hon. the Minister, which I support. But I would also like to warn the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and I do not believe that he himself will be guilty of what I wish to warn against&#x2014;lest at any stage in the implementation of this Bill, at any stage in the administration of Black education, ideological considerations should intervene. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that no ideological considerations and no taint of discrimination appears within the sphere for which he is responsible. We are aware that over the years his predecessors with their ideological approach to education and other matters relating to the Black people, caused some of the members of the administrative machine to become tainted with this ideology. If there are any of those people in his department who still suffer from that taint, this hon. Minister must ensure that they are made aware that they may not allow ideological considerations to appear on any occasion at all or they will have to pay the price. I believe the hon. the Minister is in duty bound to take a very firm line should there be any evidence among any of his officials of that tendency. And one cannot blame these people because they suffered so long under the régime of previous Ministers who were motivated by ideological instead of humanitarian and practical considerations.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. President, I believe that we are able to support this Bill as a whole. As far as certain aspects are concerned I have sounded a warning to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister is a midwife to this child and I believe that it will be stillborn or it will be a crippled, handicapped youth with all the psychological hangups of such people if the hon. the Minister does not heed my warning.</p>
<p>There is only one clause to which we have an objection, and that is clause 2. This arises not because we have no faith in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s control as such. However, clause 2 provides that all final control in education rests in the hands of the Minister of Education and Training. We on this side of the House believe that education is a matter which should be left in the hands of the various race groups concerned, the different communities, and that the only function of a central authority is that of a co-ordinating nature. We believe that each community has a right and a duty to control its own educational matters and that the central authority should only co-ordinate as between the various groups.</p>
<p>I am of course aware that under the existing situation it is not possible for the hon. the Minister to provide that system. Our approach to the constitutional make-up of South Africa is substantially different, although here again it would appear that the Select Committee to which my hon. colleague has been appointed, makes provision for including our point of view to some extent at least. But at this stage of course no provision has been made for that new dispensation and we will raise our objection to this clause at the Committee Stage.</p>
<p>In other respects we are glad to support a Bill which shows so much improvement over its predecessors and which in the educational field holds out hope that the Black people of South Africa will find satisfaction in the belief, we trust, that their children will enjoy a standard of education at all levels, from the pre-primary to the secondary, equal to the education of all the other peoples in our country.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I have pleasure in congratulating the hon. the Minister on the promotion&#x2014;if one can call it promotion&#x2014;he has received this afternoon. I hope that he will devote his powers, energy and all his experience with great success, and, as we know him, with much dedication to the portfolio now entrusted to him. We wish him health and strength and assure him of our complete support in this department too when he sets out on his new road.</p>
<p>I am grateful to be able to say that it is a pleasure for me to agree in principle with what the hon. Senator Henderson had to say. That does not often happen in the House, but in such matters of common nature I am pleased that we have general agreement. I also want to thank him for the constructive contribution he made in regard to the Bill as a whole. I also want to tell him that I appreciate the fact that he not only spoke constructively on the Bill as such but that he also appreciated the attitude and the approach of the hon. the Minister in regard to the handling of a sensitive matter like this.</p>
<p>I do not think it is up to me to reply to his objection to clause 2. I think the hon. the Minister will reply to that, or perhaps we can hear more at the Committee Stage about the objection which the hon. Senator and his side of the House have to this. It was good listening to him speaking in such a calm fashion on this matter. He made a contribution from which one could learn in many respects.</p>
<p>I have a special appreciation for the concluding remarks of the hon. the Minister when he drew the attention of the House and the country in particular to the fact that this Bill is enabling legislation which enable him to put education for Blacks on the level on which they want it, but that its implementation will depend largely on goodwill and the approach to the provisions of the legislation. We take this opportunity of saying in all modesty to the world, for what it is worth&#x2014;I do not think they listen to us very often but that makes no difference&#x2014;that we can only do as much as we are able to. We cannot do more than we are able to. It is no good putting an Act on the Statute Book when we do not have the means&#x2014;and now I am not referring only to money&#x2014;to implement its provisions. Those means also include the available human material for carrying out the work. Teaching is the maternal profession to all other professions, it makes no difference what colour people are. But we cannot leave it in the hands of untrained people who are unable to do this educational work properly. It will take time before the trained staff and other facilities such as buildings and the infrastructure are established to do the work and implement this measure. I repeat therefore that I noted with great appreciation the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s concluding remarks.</p>
<p>I should like to express my personal and I think also this side of the House&#x2019;s appreciation that the principle of mother-tongue education has been embodied in this measure. I had experience of this in 1949 when I had the privilege of being a member of the Transvaal Provincial Council. I participated at the time in a rather unpleasant struggle in the council in regard to a delicate and important matter, i.e. mother-tongue education. I therefore personally really do appreciate the fact that it has been embodied in this Bill. We on this side can do no more than express our gratitude to the Select Committee which considered this Bill. We have noted the amendments and I think we owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister referred to another matter for which I should like to express my thanks. I know I speak for a lot of people when I thank him for his words of appreciation to the many farmers who have built schools on their farms. This has often happened under difficult circumstances, and many farmers possibly did not always have the necessary scientific knowledge, but the goodwill was there. Schools were built and an attempt was made to offer educational opportunities to the Black children on the farms. We are grateful that the hon. the Minister referred to this and, if necessary, I think we want to doubly record the fact that we are grateful for the work that has been done.</p>
<p>In conclusion I should like to make an appeal on this occasion that in the process of the training and the education of Black children an appreciation and sense of values will be inculcated into them and their parents. The desire to retain what has been put at their disposal must also be engendered in them. Even though facilities do not always comply with the ideals we set, that is what we must strive for. In this connection I think I may well quote a few lines from a poem by A. G. Visser, namely&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">As jy nie het wat jy bemin nie,<br/>Bemin dan wat jy het.</block>
<p>Let us inculcate this idea in everybody, without any accompanying reproach, so that we do not burn what we have but build upon what has been given with goodwill. The simple fact that this side of the House will not vote against this Bill testifies to the fact that we support the provisions contained therein.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the hon. Senator Van den Berg and I agree with much of what he said. The tone of his remarks was very welcome. However, the hon. Senator referred to mother-tongue education and in this regard I cannot let certain things be said go unanswered. The reputation of the Nationalist Party in regard to mother-tongue education was a very scandalous one, particularly in the Transvaal. The hon. Senator, whose experience in politics is probably longer than mine, will recall the arguments and the rows that went on in the Transvaal province in particular in regard to this question of mother-tongue education. If I remember rightly, a present Minister of the Cabinet, Mr. Marais Steyn, used to wax very eloquent about this matter in a place called Vereeniging where the Transvaal Provincial Council actually changed the law because the parents of a particular school rejected the policy of the province. [Interjections.] I think therefore that the hon. Senator should recall some of the history of his own party in regard to mother-tongue education.</p>
<p>But I am not in a quarrelsome mood this afternoon by any manner of means. I do not accept the Bill before us, not for any hard or bitter reasons but for a reason I will explain to the hon. the Minister in a moment.</p>
<p>I want to say at the outset that I think the Bill has very many encouraging aspects. I agree with the hon. the Minister that it does herald a new era in the field of Black education. But not the least of the encouraging aspects in regard to the legislation before us is, I believe, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own personality and integrity in matters of this sort. I think that the success of legislation of the nature we are dealing with will to a very large extent depend on the person of the Minister. [Interjections.] I am dealing with the matter in front of me and the matter in front of me at the moment tells me that I can expect great things of the hon. the Minister in this very difficult field.</p>

<p>The hon. Senator may think that, but I believe that if a person such as myself can heap praise on a Minister it is better than when it comes from hon. Senators opposite who, every time they get up to speak, do nothing else but spend 10 minutes praising and &#x201C;dankie-ing&#x201D; the Minister. At least I very seldom do it, but when I do do it, it is worth a lot more than when those hon. Senators do it.</p>
<p>I believe that the difficulty with legislation of this nature is that it is not altogether in the hands of the Minister who controls the portfolio at the time. Its success also depends largely on the extent to which the Cabinet supports that particular Minister. It is no good the Minister in dealing with the legislation before us wanting to do certain things if he does not get the support of his Cabinet colleagues. They may, for example, block any extra finance that he might need. This is therefore a question for the whole Nationalist. Party Cabinet and all the hon. Senators on the other side who only too seldom apply their minds to matters of this nature. [Interjections.] I cannot hear the hon. Senator Van Schoor. Perhaps he was not educated under this particular Bill.</p>

<p>I did not say that. I am blamed for many things, Mr. President, but you cannot blame me for that one. The greatest drawback of this legislation, as I see it, is that it entrenches the belief in separation. It is in the spirit of the separation of education, separate legislation in regard to other matters, the separation of labour and the separation of everything we deal with in South Africa. Sir, I believe that this is the problem confronting us today. We have this sort of legislation, good legislation, which takes us a good deal further than we have been in the past, but which cripples itself, handicaps itself, because it is still hidebound by this philosophy that things must be separated. I believe this is the major flaw in the Bill and I believe it could become a fatal flaw in the education system of South Africa as it has become in other things. I am sorry to have to say that to my mind this is the greatest disappointment to me in what otherwise would have been good legislation.</p>
<p>There is no question but that we are moving away from apartheid in small matters. We are moving away from it in minor details but the major principles are still being entrenched; they are being entrenched in new legislation and I believe that some day we will come to regret this.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister concluded his speech by saying that Black education is beneficial not only to the Blacks but also to the Whites and to South Africa as a whole. I could not agree with him more, but then I ask, why does he chain it? Why does he shackle it with measures of this nature so that we are always seen to be operating separately? I do not understand the logic of the thinking that does this to us.</p>
<p>You know, Sir, in the Army, in our front lines&#x2014;we might say in the front lines against apartheid or in the defence of apartheid&#x2014;our soldiers are serving together; they are living together and, unfortunately, dying together in some cases. But apartheid, separation, is a thing of the past; it does not exist any more, and rightly so. There is no separate command in the Army; we do not have a separate command for the Africans in the Army or a separate command for the Coloureds or the Indians. It is one unified command; it would never work any other way. I do not understand why it cannot work in regard to education, because no matter what one might say about defence and anything else in South Africa, there can be no doubt that the education of the people of South Africa, all the people of South Africa, is South Africa&#x2019;s greatest and best defence. I do not believe anybody would dispute that. That is why I say to the hon. the Minister that I am disappointed that he should still find, wittingly or unwittingly, that he has to shackle this legislation, good legislation, to this major flaw which can destroy us.</p>
<p>The NRP are supporting this legislation because they believe that each ethnic group should control its own affairs. I am not quarrelling with that principle but where I do draw a line is, that I do not believe one can control one&#x2019;s own affairs unless one can control the pursestrings that go with it. While the Whites of South Africa govern, they control the purse strings in South Africa, and no matter how much independence one gives to other groups, other nationalities, other ethnic groups, no matter how much independence there is in the field of education or in any other field, while one controls the pursestrings one controls one&#x2019;s destiny. It might well be said that the Africans will now control their destiny to a larger extent but that argument is somewhat destroyed by clause 2 which the hon. Senator Henderson also had some qualms about. But even ignoring that, Mr. President, if one does not control the pursestrings one does not finally control one&#x2019;s affairs. I believe that this will in fact bring politics more deeply into Black education. Unfortunately it has caused problems in the past, and I believe that it will cause problems again because here where we have had the opportunity to move away from the things that caused the problem in the past, we have in fact entrenched it once more in this new legislation. I see that, Sir, as a great disappointment, a major disappointment, and I must say that I am very sorry that the hon. the Minister did not take this opportunity to correct this state of affairs.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister accepts that changes are necessary, and I accept that he is a hundred per cent sincere when he makes that statement. But he says that these things cannot be accomplished overnight. I do not quarrel too much with that either, except that I would say to him that they must be tackled as though they had to be complished overnight. That is the problem. One cannot sit back and say: I cannot do this now; it is a long-term project, this question of compulsory free education&#x2014;which is the ideal of the hon. the Minister and everybody else&#x2014; but it cannot be done overnight. I believe that we must say that it has got to be done overnight, and then we will find that we will come close to getting it done in that period, because this is the only way to approach it.</p>
<p>You know, Sir, when it comes to matters of this sort it seems that we are able to find money when it is absolutely necessary. The price of oil has just been increased beyond our imagination of a year ago. But suddenly we can find the money. We had to find it and we did find it. Our Defence budget has been increased many times over the past few years, and rightly so, but, Sir, we found the money because we had to. I am saying to the hon. the Minister that we have got to find the money. It seems to be an awe-inspiring task that we are faced with, but there is no alternative, Mr. President. We have to find the money to bring about the better education of our Black people a lot quicker than probably any of us think is possible.</p>
<p>As I said just now, this is our greatest defence&#x2014; the proper education of the mass of our people. I say, therefore, that we must get our priorities right. The hon. Senator Henderson mentioned them. Let us get our priorities right because at the moment they are nowhere near correct.</p>
<p>I want to quote to the hon. the Minister, for the record, a question that I asked in 1977, and he probably knows this. This was just two years ago, and two years ago we spent R554 million on educating 918 000 White pupils. We spent R114 million on educating 650 000 Coloureds. We spent R44 million on educating 187 000 Indians. But we spent R152 million on educating 3 898 000 African students. If one does the obvious little sum, it works out that we were spending R600-odd on educating a White student and no more than R40 on educating an African student. That was the figure two years ago. One might say that it has improved since then. In fact, the Government likes to say that the situation has improved considerably since then, but let us look at the figure at present. The hon. Senator Henderson mentioned the total amount spent. We are now spending something like R700 a year on a White child and R70 on an African child. This is Government spending on education. In other words, two years ago the gap between what we spent on an African and a White child was R560; that gap, despite the increase, has now widened to R630. What sort of argument is it then when the Government says that it is now spending more on Black education, or that it is increasing the amount percentagewise, than it is spending on White education? That is perfectly true, but the gap widens nevertheless because the percentages are not big enough. I am sure the hon. the Minister knows this, but this is the point which must be brought home to the public of South Africa. For the peace and the well-being and the future of South Africa we are going to have to pay. We are going to have to pay in guns or we are going to have to pay in education and I say we must pay in education because it will save us in the long run from having to pay in guns. This is what our future will depend on. I am not throwing anything at the hon. the Minister; I am not trying to put any heat into the debate. What I am trying to get across is the urgency of the matter that is before us. I know the hon. the Minister believes it is urgent and if he wants me to help him to let the public know how urgent it is I shall be only too happy to do so. But, Sir, we must get our priorities right&#x2014;the Government must get them right. We must spend more money on education; we must spend more money on Black education until it hurts, because in the long run that will be our only security.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister says he is not prepared to lower the standard of White education by using the money earmarked for White educations for Black education. I do not quarrel with that, Sir; I think he is quite right. One does not lower the standard of Whites to uplift the standard of Blacks. That would be ridiculous, but one must uplift the standard of Blacks. The hon. the Minister agrees. It is going to cost more money and I say let us find the money. Let us find the money even if it hurts because in the long term this will mean our survival. It is true that the whole system of education is changing. In the case of White education, for instance, there are fewer private schools today than there were ten years ago. In my own experience the number of Catholic schools is decreasing rapidly. Unfortunately, this seems to be the trend because the costs are too high. So the pattern of education is changing and the private schools are disappearing to a greater extent than ever before. I believe this is unfortunate because education is losing a special aspect which is necessary. In the case of African education my records show that in 1962 there were 780 private schools, mission schools, church schools, etc. with 90 000 pupils. In other words, they were playing a very major role in the field of African education. But in 1972, ten years later, the number of such schools had dropped to almost half&#x2014;to 503 to be exact&#x2014;but they still had 85 000 pupils. In other words, the private schools, the Black church schools were also feeling the economic pinch and were unable to carry on just as the White schools are feeling the pinch today. This is a change in our education pattern which is, I believe, to be regretted, and it is something to which the department of the hon. the Minister should pay greater attention. It may mean increased subsidies to church or religious schools, but this must be done because they play an important part in education.</p>
<p>Mr. President, no matter how unfair it might seem, under our present system of education it will always be said that the Government is discriminating against Black education because Black education, while it remains separate, will be seen to be discriminatory. If the hon. the Minister were to say to me that he is not discriminating I would agree with him, but the message will come across loud and clear that everything that goes wrong in Black education&#x2014;and things sometimes go wrong beyond the control of human beings&#x2014;will be seen to have gone wrong because it is separated. That is a tragedy that should be avoided. We experienced it in Soweto. No matter how hard one tries, people will say that because it is separate it is being discriminated against This is why I do not understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s ready acceptance that Black education in South Africa must be separated. There should be one controlling body for education. The education of all the population groups should be controlled by one body, so that if something goes wrong in respect of one section, if a particular section of the community is not working as well as it should, it will not be seen as discrimination. Today it will be and it will continue to be seen as discrimination. As I have said, even with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own charisma and compassion for this particular subject he will not be able to avoid that accusation. It will stick. I say: never mind the political mistakes the Government makes, but this is a mistake that is embodied in this Bill.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has told us about the amount of consultation that has taken place. That is correct and he should be congratulated on it but I want to quote some of the reports in regard to that consultation. The biggest complaint of the Transvaal United African Teachers&#x2019; Association was, in fact, that the Bill provided for separate bodies for education on a racial basis. That was one; time does not permit me to quote them all. The hon. the Minister knows the reports to which I am referring. They objected to separate teachers&#x2019; councils in very responsible language. I do not think the hon. the Minister could object to the language that they used to express their objections. The Federal Council of Transvaal African School Boards resolved unanimously that the draft Education and Training Bill be rejected totally in principle in favour of the implementation of a unitary education system. In other words, they make the same point. Those are the African people themselves. But the White people are making a similar appeal&#x2014;not politicians, not people like myself who, you may say, Sir, has an axe to grind and can see very little right in the Government anyway. That is probably true, I see very little that is right with them. But the people who reject this Bill are not politicians like myself. The Durban Chamber of Commerce objects to this Bill. I have argued with them politically on many occasions because I do not think their thinking is right politically. They say there should be one body controlling education in South Africa. Assocom says there should be one body for education in South Africa and they are not politicians, Sir. So I say to the hon. the Minister that I like his Bill; there is much about it that I like, but I believe he has ruined it by insisting that we should be separated at all costs in things like education which is a very important matter.</p>
<p>Before I resume my seat, I should like to put one question to the hon. the Minister because my time is limited. I should like to refer him to clause 40. I shall be as brief as I can. The marginal note states: &#x201C;Unauthorized persons may not visit certain schools or enter school grounds or school premises.&#x201D; I want to say immediately to the hon. the Minister that obviously one cannot have every Tom, Dick and Harry walking into a school. So I accept straightaway that there must be some control. However, clause 40(d) says&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">A parent or guardian in connection with the education of his child, or for the purpose of attending a sports meeting, concert or any other event of the school in which his child has an interest.</block>
<p>The way this paragraph reads, it would seem that the parent or guardian can attend the school in which his child is but he would seem to be prohibited, as I read the provision, from going to another school where his child may perhaps be engaged in a concert or sporting event. This is how it reads but I shall be very pleased to hear from the hon. the Minister that that interpretation is not correct. I am quite sure that that is not what is meant by the paragraph.</p>
<p>Clause 40(f) read&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Members of the community who at the request &#x2026;</block>
<p>This has now been changed to read&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; who at the invitation of the principal attend a particular school activity.</block>
<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister what he means by &#x201C;a member of the community&#x201D; in this respect. Say, for instance, I belong to the St. John Ambulance Brigade and my organization wants to go and give a lecture at a particular school on the Red Cross or something of that nature. We are not members of that community, if one assumes that it is the African community to which reference is made here. It would seem to me that we would have to get permission from the school principal. That is perfectly correct; obviously one cannot go into a school just like that. But lower down it says &#x201C;certain people&#x201D;&#x2014;and I am talking about that type of person&#x2014;&#x201C;may not enter a school without the written permission of the Secretary&#x201D;. Bearing in mind the type of person who should be allowed to enter a school, the type of person whose presence may be to the benefit of the school, the school principal should surely be the person to decide who should or should not come into his school. If one has to write to the Secretary it could be a very involved process. I am confident in my own mind that the school principal is not going to allow the wrong sort of people to come into his school. This is obviously what the hon. the Minister is trying to prevent. This is what I am trying to prevent. I do not want those sort of people in the schools but I do believe that the way it is framed at the moment it might preclude or it might make it difficult for an organization such as a drama society or the St. John Ambulance Brigade or some such other body to pursue its activities at a school. I believe those decisions should be left to the principal of the school.</p>
<p>With those few remarks I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I shall oppose this legislation, not because I do not think it is good legislation; I do; but, unfortunately for me, it embodies something which my philosophy tells me is bad in practice, which is in fact dangerous to and not good for the wellbeing of the future of South Africa. I would like to see one controlling body for all education, and I am sorry the hon. the Minister has not taken the opportunity to effect that change in this case. On the other hand, I believe that his attitude to the problem, his attitude to the subject is a very welcome one and a very healthy one. However, because my objections are so strong I shall have to oppose the Bill before us.</p>

<p>The hon. Senator must listen carefully to find out if he is still on the right road. I am sorry, according to my information, that the hon. the Minister will no longer be handling this portfolio. I say this without reflection on Dr. Hartzenberg. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister took over the portfolio at the time he did. I really do think he is the right man for this portfolio and I say this from personal observation over a number of years. It is a pity that at this stage, when he is performing such constructive work in this connection, he has to do something else. It is not in our hands, but I just want to say that I appreciate &#x2026;</p>

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard">HON. SENATOR</person>:</from>
<p>He is taking over White education.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>An hon. Senator says now that he is taking over White education. I am absolutely sure that he will do that too to the best of his ability. His attitude in this connection, in this important portfolio, has always given me pleasure.</p>
<p>I should like to raise a few matters in this connection. In the first place I want to say that I was pleased to hear the hon. the Minister say that the education levy will remain but that it will be spent in another way, viz. for sports facilities for the Black child. It is a fact that with a healthy body one acquires a healthy mind. I am also very pleased that the parents of these children are being asked to contribute to this facility. One can of course say that the things one gets for nothing one does not appreciate as much as the things one works for.</p>
<p>The other point on which I can fortunately agree with the hon. Senator G. P. van den Berg&#x2014;and I hope he feels now that he is on the right road&#x2014;is in regard to the contribution the farming community makes to the education of Black children on farms. In that regard I am very pleased to see that we will also be given the opportunity of getting secondary education in the rural areas. I think of a previous argument we had in this hon. House when former hon. Ministers stood firm by the decision that primary school education could be given in the rural areas but that the children on farms should be sent to their homelands to receive their secondary education there. I am very pleased that there has been this change in attitude.</p>
<p>I do not want to cross swords with Senators on this side of the House who have had so much to say about spending more and more on Black education. I agree one hundred per cent with that. I think we must spend as much as we possibly can. That is in the interests of everybody in the country. But we must also take care that we do not put everything on a plate for them. In this regard I should like to refer to a very important point. In my area we have two black spots which over the years have unfortunately become the orphans of the department. I speak of the black spots Leeufontein and Braklaagte in the Marico district. I mentioned this as a good example when we had this burning down of schools in the Black urban areas. The department has withdrawn its assistance there over the years. But that community built its own classrooms. Under the guidance of their headman, Chief Sibagodi, they now have schools there which accommodate more than 1 000 children. These are buildings they have erected themselves. During those riots not one single window pane was broken in that school and not a single classroom was burned.</p>
<p>The second point I want to put to the hon. the Minister refers to the removal of those people. I have already brought this to the attention of his successor. I feel that when those people are removed we must take care that facilities, particularly as far as their schools are concerned, are established in the region where they are to be resettled. I do not know what the position will be and how much compensation etc. they will get for the school buildings which they have erected with their own money. I make this appeal therefore, and I have already brought this to the attention of Dr. Hartzenberg, because it will make the removal that much easier. I think in any event it will take place without any bad feelings if the facilities which they have enjoyed here are also established for them there, especially in the field of education. I should like to support this legislation. I think it is a step in the right direction. The hon. the Minister said in his final remarks that we were now entering a new era in Black education. He is man enough to admit that we may perhaps not have done sufficient in the past and that there were weaknesses. I agree with him one hundred per cent that this investment in Black education is not only to the advantage of the Black man and the Black child but also of the whole of South Africa. I should like to support him completely in this Bill. There may be weaknesses. There may be things we do not really like. But in general it will be worthwhile if we all give our full support to this matter.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I find it difficult to thank everybody for their kind words, but when I say thank you, it comes from my heart.</p>
<p>Pursuant to what has been said about my going to another department, I myself find it something of a &#x2026; well, I really cannot call it a disappointment because I am going to a department where I really want to serve. But I should also have liked to remain longer in this department. I can only testify to the large measure of goodwill that I have encountered from the officials in the department, from my colleagues on this side of the House, both here and in the Other Place, and also from the people from whom I differ politically and we make no secret about it. I also knew that if I was straight with them, I should always have the necessary respect from them in return. I should like by way of a farewell to ask hon. Senators on both sides of the House to give this department and its officials who do a particularly difficult job of work the support which I do not think they always receive. There were a few remarks which I know were not ill-meant. There was one which I think was made by the hon. Senator Henderson.</p>
<p>†If I remember correctly, the hon. Senator Henderson mentioned people suffering under a &#x201C;taint&#x201D;. I hope that it was not meant in an unfriendly manner.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#henderson">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">C. C. HENDERSON</person>:</from>
<p>It was not meant to be unfriendly at all; it was merely that I recognized realities.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I accept that it was not said in an unfriendly way towards officials in my department because I want to state without fear of contradiction that I have never seen so much devotion to a thankless task at times, as I have seen in the Department of Education for Blacks. Both White and Black people have under very trying circumstances at times, fulfilled a mammoth task over many years.</p>
<p>*I should like to ask for that goodwill on behalf of South Africa. Mr. President, I believe in the policy of the NP. It is no use fighting about it today because I think that the policy of the NP in relation to the development of the independent homelands is also the right policy for South Africa. We may differ on this but in the first place I want to point out that we can build the most wonderful railway lines, erect the most luxurious buildings and have the finest homes for Ministers and the best parliamentary buildings in the country but for that policy to succeed, if the people are not trained to govern the country, the policy of this side of the House is doomed. So if there are still people who are under the wrong impression that what we spend on the Black people is really contrary to the policy of the NP, I want to say with the greatest emphasis that such people do not understand the policy of the NP. They are trying to wreck the policy and the success that the NP has achieved. To educate people in our own country and in our neighbouring states to govern themselves at every level where expertise is necessary&#x2014;in the commercial field and in a proper public service where corruption and other things will not prevail&#x2014;is a prerequisite for an infrastructure of any sort. The education and the training that is necessary and the character-forming of the Black people, just as with the White people, are necessary for the policy of the NP to succeed. And we on this side of the House must consider this as what we are earnestly striving for for South Africa.</p>
<p>Mr. President I also think it is one&#x2019;s Christian duty not to begrudge others what one claims for oneself. It is easy to say that the people must look after themselves. I was formerly a minister of religion and I know that somewhere the Bible says&#x2014;perhaps the hon. Senator on my right can tell us where it appears&#x2014;that if a man comes to you and tells you that he is hungry, and you say to him: &#x201C;Go away and feed yourself&#x201D; or if a man comes to you and says he is naked and you say to him: &#x201C;Go away and get warm,&#x201D; then you are like a Pharisee; then you have done nothing and less than nothing for him. These people are our responsibility; they have been given to us and we have a duty to help them to develop to their full potential. Sir, I think we shall reap the benefit if we work together in this direction.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that this legislation is the foundation on which we can build. It offers guidelines in terms of which we must work and I am convinced that it can serve as a means to achieve that objective.</p>
<p>†But I would like to remind the hon. Senator Henderson&#x2014;and I plead with him to accept this&#x2014;that Rome was not built in a day. The hon. Senator Winchester apologized for having to leave, but I would like to say the same to him: Rome was not built in a day. But I agree with both hon. Senators. I think we should at all times realize that merely getting blueprints and five year plans or ten year plans will not get us anywhere. He who has to walk a thousand miles has to take the first step. If we cannot build 7 000 class-rooms this year, then at least let us not make it imperative that next year we will need 7 700, because we did not even build 700 or 7 for that matter. What can be done today should not be left for tomorrow. I think within the framework of this Bill so many things can be achieved.</p>
<p>I was asked by both the hon. Senator Winchester and the hon. Senator Henderson about the financial aspect. Sir, I would like to assure the hon. House that it was not merely a matter of getting an Act on the Statute Book that we concerned ourselves with over the past months. And once again I have to pay tribute to the officials of my department and others who worked with us, even bodies such as the Urban Foundation and other people who interest themselves in the field of education for Blacks. Because we did not merely leave it at framing a Bill that has to become an Act. There is the greatest understanding on the part of the Cabinet as a whole for the urgency of this matter which we are at present discussing.</p>
<p>*I am grateful that I can say something here today which I was not able to say in the Other Place when the Third Reading was discussed. Representations and the same argument advanced by the hon. Senator Henderson were put to me in the Other Place by the hon. member for Durban Central as to how we would obtain the necessary funds. I can say today that the Cabinet agreed at its penultimate meeting that through other people who help us, we can obtain loans on foreign markets at low rates of interests, even as low as 3% I am told, repayable over a long period. There are very sympathetic people overseas who would like to help us in this respect. The Minister of Finance has given his approval, it has been cleared with the Department of Finance through my officials, and I believe my successor will be in a position within the next few weeks to start using this financing pattern. Provision for interest and repayments will be given priority each year in the budget.</p>
<p>†I think that this will enable us to catch up with the backlog much sooner than we in our wildest dreams had dared to hope.</p>
<p>*I hope that my successor will have the pleasure of being able to report favourably on this next year to Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I must mention the assistance we have received from various institutions, <i>inter alia</i>, the Johannesburg Municipality and Bantu Administration boards, as far as the rebuilding of schools and the building of additional classrooms are concerned. I might just mention that the officials of my department have not been idle during these months; they have worked. In 1976, 20 000 children left Soweto and, at the beginning of this year, 15 000 returned, in addition to the others whose numbers had increased in the mean time, and we could accommodate them. Within a matter of two months we found accommodation for those students with which their parents were satisfied. I think this is an achievement on the part of the department which we should note, and this took place with the co-operation of people who want to be helpful at all times.</p>
<p>†The hon. Senator Winchester asked me about one department. Well, Sir, I do not want to cross swords with him, especially not in his absence.</p>

<p>No, in fairness to the hon. Senator Winchester I must mention that he wrote me a note in which he explained that he had to catch an aircraft to Durban and apologized for his absence.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator made a few statements about mother-tongue education and about one department. I do not want to look far for witnesses to support my attitude but the PFP is always talking about enforced segregation and discrimination.</p>
<p>†I have it here in black and white and will show it to anyone who is interested&#x2014;hon. Senators from Natal will bear me out&#x2014;that at a graduation ceremony no less a person than Chief Minister Buthelezi said that anyone asking for the Black education department to be incorporated in the White department is a fool. Chief Buthelezi, a leader of the Black people, said this. I can quote so many people who have insisted that they want their own separate department. What is more, I do not think we always remember our own history. Is it not true that with Union in 1910 there was just one department of education? But the Union Parliament did not want to accept responsibility for the education of Blacks so they farmed it out to the provinces. The provinces, because they also handled education for Whites, did nothing about it. During this period the missionaries did a tremendous job of trying to alleviate the shortages of staff and facilities. They did what the government of the day did not want to do. It was only in 1953 that Black education became a department and the full responsibility of the central Government. The solution therefore does not lie in making it one department. We can make it one department tomorrow, but we still cannot build 7 000 classrooms just because we have made it one department. &#x201C;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&#x201D; Certainly, Sir, a department by any other name will not bring about the changes which are needed in this department.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I thank the official Opposition in this House for agreeing with me, as well as the hon. Senator Du Toit, but I am merely replying to what the hon. Senator Winchester said in order to put the record straight.</p>
<p>I want to mention a second instance and I do not intend to keep hon. Senators too long. The hon. Senator Van den Berg spoke about mother-tongue education.</p>
<p>*This to me is one of the amazing things about the PFP and something I cannot understand. There are seven different homelands, developing areas, independent-to-be states or whatever one wants to call them. The first thing each of those seven states says is that it wants its own department of education. They want a say over their own education. I want to say something else. When I again became Minister of the department, I asked people in Soweto why there were 16 different school boards. The Secretary of the Department then said to me that the department had to take the wishes of the parents into consideration. The Tswanas said that they did not want to serve on the same school board as the Zulus and that they wanted their own school board. They do that, and these are not silly stories.</p>
<p>On another occasion I spent a whole day with people like Prof. Ntsanwisi, Dr. Phatudi and Chief Mangope, now President Mangope, negotiating certain matters. They gave me leave to repeat this. Just outside Pretoria there is an area which falls under Bophuthatswana, i.e. Garankuwa, and the Winterveld region. All the Blacks who in the time of Dr. Verwoerd worked in Pretoria were resettled there from Sophiatown and other places.</p>
<p>They also had their own schools but the resettlement was not done on an ethnic basis. It took myself and the Commissioner-General a whole day to make peace in the end. The then Chief Minister Mangope said that the children could go to school there but that they had to learn Tswana. The Sothos said over their dead bodies would that be done. The people of Gazankulu said the same. We were compelled to lay out the town of Mabopane. Those who do not believe me can go and have a look at that town. It is in the trust area, and the first things we built were schools to accommodate the children who could not go to school in Bophuthatswana. In the meantime I thought I was very clever. We built it as an international town and those who are interested in national relationships must remember what I am now going to say. I agreed with other people that we had to think up a joint or combined name for the town. We then decided to take the first letters of the different nations, i.e. the Sotho, the Shangaan, the Nguni and the Venda and to make a name from these. So we arrived at the name Soshanguve. The first thing that happened after that was that the Vendas came to us and asked why they came at the end of the word. Then the Ngunis came and asked why they were in the middle of the name. They wanted to be at the beginning because they had the most children. That name fell away and we now call the town Mabopane. That is how set people are on their languages. Language is, after all, part of one&#x2019;s soul. It is the same for the Black man, and anyone who does not believe that does not believe a truth which is as old as the hills. In this connection I can show hon. Senators documents from Unesco and the Organization of African Unity in which it is claimed that dispense the practice of forcing English down peoples&#x2019; throats must be dispensed with.</p>
<p>†My English-speaking friends will forgive me now if I tell them what I read. We know that English is a world language. I think it is necessary that English be taught to Afrikaansspeaking people and to everybody else, because it is a world language the same as French is. I think that a person who has mastered English can get somewhere in the world. We have to teach English to our Black pupils. But what did the Blacks say when they tried to do that in Nigeria? They branded it a new method of colonialization and told their children not to speak a word of English.</p>

<p>Yes, but they said that in the field of education it was a method of colonalization and they insisted that English should be done away with as a medium of instruction in schools and that only the vernacular should be used. Those are facts.</p>
<p>*Having said that, it still does not detract from the fact that there is a lot of work to be done and that this is only the framework within which things have to be done.</p>
<p>In conclusion I want to refer to a very important matter which the hon. Senator Du Toit raised, i.e. the question of the removal of Black spots without providing the necessary facilities. I am pleased that this matter has been placed on record because I feel it cannot be over-emphasized. People must not only be supplied with houses in other areas but they must also have the necessary facilities. I hope my friends in the Cape will accept it in that spirit if my successor starts building schools for the people of Crossroads. One cannot move the people of Crossroads and then expect them to stay in those houses while their children roam the streets. I hope people will give my successor the opportunity to move happy children if they have to be moved as has been planned. I think it is important that attention should be given to this aspect. I Should like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the hon. Senators who have participated in the discussion, particularly the hon. Senator Van den Berg.</p>
<p>Question agreed to.</p>
<p>Bill read a Second Time.</p>
</speech>
<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>
<p>Clause 2:</p>
<speech by="#henderson">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">C. C. HENDERSON</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to speak on this clause which provides for the control and administration of Black education and the organizing of and reporting on activities of the department, to be under the control of the Minister. It provides, in fact, for all control in the final analysis to be in the hands of the Minister.</p>
<p>In my Second Reading speech I pointed out that in this regard there is a philosophical difference between this side of the House and that of the hon. the Minister. We believe that each community should control its own education. I am very glad to note that the hon. the Minister himself supports this principle. He quoted the words of the Chief Minister of kwaZulu and other people, and on that basis we are unable to support the clause. We do not support the Bill in general terms, but this particular clause is not in accord with our approach to education which is based on the decentralization of all matters which are of concern to the respective communities. As the hon. the Minister himself agrees, education is one of those matters which are of peculiar interest&#x2014;I emphasize that word &#x201C;peculiar&#x201D;&#x2014;to the communities concerned.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned the history of education in South Africa. I made notes on this particular point to illustrate our point of view, i.e. that up to 1953 all education was controlled by the provinces. May I add, Mr. Chairman, that a great deal of success was achieved under that system. I think of Natal where the Indian people are the best educated group of people, other than the Whites, in South Africa, and I believe that credit for that must go to the Natal Provincial Administration. I know of a man who is regarded by this Government as a radical&#x2014;I am not sure that he is&#x2014;and is a leader of the Coloured people in Natal who was asked recently whether he would like Coloured education to be restored to the Province of Natal, and he said he would emphatically prefer that to the present system of centralized control.</p>
<p>When we say that we wish to decentralize the control of education to the various communities we do not advocate this in the sense of apartheid as we have come to know apartheid. The hon. Senator Winchester who has left, constantly emphasized this question of apartheid, but we do not view the separation of those matters which are peculiar to the respective communities as a question of apartheid. We view these matters as those over which the different communities desire to exercise control, in their own interests, for emotional and practical reasons, and over which they do not desire people who are not of their community to exercise control. It is in this sense that we wish to decentralize the control of education.</p>
<p>In so far as control of the purse-strings is concerned, we believe that the various communities will also have taxation powers over their own communities and so they will also be able to make a contribution to their own education. But obviously for a long time the Blacks will not have sufficient financial resources to pay for all their own education, and the central administration, federal or confederal, will have to provide a very substantial proportion of that finance, and possibly the major portion, depending on when our system can be introduced. But the Black people, as they advance educationally, will also advance economically, and they will be able to assume an ever-increasing proportion of the responsibility for their own education. So even on that issue we find no difficulty in pursuing our philosophical approach.</p>
<p>For these reasons I am unable to support clause 2.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-education">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, may I respectfully point out to the hon. Senator that I do not think he has read this clause together with the other clauses. Clause 2(1) states&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It shall be the function of the department under the direction and control of the Minister to perform all the work necessary for or incidental to the general administration of education for Blacks.</block>
<p>I repeat, &#x201C;general administration&#x201D;. Surely there must be a central body or department dealing with general administration and through which reports can be submitted to Parliament and to the Controller and Auditor-General.</p>
<p>Subsection (2) reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The department may organize its activities or any part thereof in regions and inspection circuits determined by the Minister from time to time.</block>
<p>So the whole concept of decentralization is contained in this subsection. Subsection (3) refers to the report which has to be submitted annually. But this clause must in addition, be read together with clause 3. This states, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Minister may after consultation with, or consideration of proposals made by, the Council &#x2026;</block>
<p>which is defined&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">(f) that recognition be given to the active involvement of the parents and the communities in the education system through parent-teachers&#x2019; associations, local or domestic committees or councils or in any similar authoritative manner.</block>
<p>Then there is clause 7 which provides for school boards, if they are required. It reads, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<p>I agree fully with what the hon. Senator says, but it is decentralized and when one reads the clause referring to the Council, one finds it is stipulated that as far as possible these people should be Black parents themselves. When one reads the Bill one finds that the whole idea of the hon. Senator is embodied in it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the hon. the Minister. The department is concerned basically, apart from its other activities in the homelands, with education for Black children in our so-called White areas. If one takes the example which the hon. the Minister has given us, we realize that what is at issue is what happened at Mabopane. I do not think it is practical to say that it must be left to the various ethnic groups. It can happen, and I think sufficient provision has already been made for this, but I should also like to bring this point home very clearly to the hon. the Minister. The department will chiefly be concerned with the education of the Black people within the so-called White area.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am aware of the points the hon. the Minister has made but of course, the examples to which the hon. the Minister has referred, namely the active involvement of parents and communities in the educational system, together with the reference to clause 7, only refer to the very localized bodies such as parent-teachers&#x2019; associations and Soweto control. They are not in keeping with what we believe should be the case. When I refer to community control of education, I am not referring purely to the local community. I am referring to control of education by all the Zulu people, by all the Tswana people, by all the Ciskei people. I am speaking, in that sense. I appreciate that in terms of this Bill and with the existing constitutional set-up as we have it in South Africa with a centralized control, it is in fact not possible for the hon. the Minister to meet me. I accept this. It will be impossible for the hon. the Minister to decentralize to the extent that we contemplate because of the existing constitutional dispensation in South Africa. But I am opposing clause 2 so as to emphasize our approach&#x2014;not because I oppose the Bill as a whole, not because in terms of the Bill as such I disagree with the necessity of including clause 2&#x2014;which is to place on record the fact that in the field of education the NRP wishes to see the control of education devolve upon each of the communities which we visualize will be communities in terms of our federal/confederal set-up. It is for those reasons that we want it on record that it is because of this policy approach that we oppose clause 2. We oppose it for no other reason. I accept that the hon. the Minister cannot, with the best will in the world, accept the deletion of this clause but we oppose it for the reasons I have just stated and we shall have to remain adamant in our opposition to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot understand how it is at all possible for this to work in a practical way even under the policy of the NRP. Let us take the case of Soweto. How does the hon.

Senator would explain how this can be written into legislation so that it can work in a practical way.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty because he is thinking in terms of the situation as it exists now. This is a very good Bill for that situation. But let me take the hon. the Minister back to his own party&#x2019;s constitutional plans. The constitutional plan of the Government visualizes a parliament for the Indian people, a parliament for the Coloured people and a parliament for the Whites. Those parliaments will control the education of their own people. There is no question about that. We say that the shortcoming in that plan is that there is no provision for a parliament for the urban Black man. What we are saying when we object to clause 2, is that we see the future constitutional pattern of this country as including not only a parliament for the Coloured people, a parliament for the Indian people and a parliament for the White people, but a parliament for the urbanized Black people as well. We have no objection to the self-governing Black territories running their own show. I always say it is not for me to tell the Xhosa how to educate his child and by the same token I do not expect the Xhosa to tell me how I must educate my child. So there is no problem about the self-governing Black territories such as kwaZulu and the Ciskei. Obviously there is no problem either about the independent ones, but we come back to this residual problem of the urban Black man who is not attached to a homeland. [Interjections.] Yes, and the ones on White farms. All we are saying when we oppose this clause in principle is that there should be an authority established to run Black education in the urban areas, an authority controlled by the Black man. That is all we say. There should be such an authority; just as the hon. the Minister can make out a case for Coloured education to be controlled by the Coloured man and for Indian education to be controlled by the Indian man, because that is the situation that the Government&#x2019;s constitutional plan visualizes. We are simply saying that we want to see a similar set-up for the urban Black man. We want the urban Black man to have a parliament one of whose functions should be the responsibility of seeing to the education of the Black man. We are not saying that this is a bad Bill; we say it is a very excellent Bill within the constitutional framework which exists at the moment. But we see a different constitutional framework, not the hon. Senator Winchester&#x2019;s integrated constitution in which all education will be controlled by one centralized body. I do not see how the hon. Senator Winchester can even reconcile that with his own party&#x2019;s policy. He is not here now, so I will not go any further into that. We see a parliament for the urban Black man as well, including the Black man on the farms &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senators Horak and Henderson spoke about Nigeria and it seemed to me that they did not quite believe it. I should like to quote something in this connection about mother-tongue education. It was written by A. Babs Fafunwa of the University of Ife in Nigeria. It reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The broad aim of an integrated primary school curriculum is to help the child develop his natural abilities by creating the necessary environment &#x2026;</block>
<p>†Then he says the following in regard to education in the mother-tongue&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Hypotheses: Indeed language patterns and other cultural milieu are so closely related that there is a reciprocal influence between them. The child&#x2019;s language is an integral part of his culture and the mother-tongue is the best medium for educating him; but if for any other extraneous reason, we cannot do this, it is not because the other media are better.</block>
<p>Then he comes to his conclusion and says&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; that his command of English will be improved considerably if he is taught English as an entirely separate subject by a specially trained teacher throughout the six years.</block>

<speech by="#minister-of-education">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senator Winchester asked me what the requirements would be if one went to a school. The reply is that just as in the case of White schools, the principal is in charge of this matter. If an Act provides that the Secretary or the Minister must give consent, it is always understood that the Minister or the Secretary has the right of delegation. It is a perfectly normal thing, as in the case with White education, for powers to be delegated to the principal.</p>
<p>†This clause was inserted especially because the principals of the Black schools insisted that they be assisted in some way to keep out insurance agents, salesmen, etc. as they have not been able to stop them from coming to the schools. That is why they expressed a desire for this. I merely want to put it on record because the hon. Senator Winchester asked me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I would just like to make one or two comments at this Third Reading stage of the Bill. The hon. the Minister stated that Rome was not built in a day so far as the developments are concerned. I accept that and I stated that in my Second Reading speech in different words. However, I do wish to emphasize again the urgent priority which it is necessary to give to this matter.</p>
<p>I also agree with the hon. the Minister that there should be no reduction in educational standards for Whites. We on this side of the House believe in the private enterprise system which creates wealth for the benefit of all. Socialism believes in reducing everybody to the lowest common denominator. If the hon. the Minister were to reduce the standard of education for Whites, the only effect would be to reduce the standard of education for everybody. Every attempt must be made therefore to raise the education of Blacks to the level of that of Whites. In saying this I do think that there are occasions when unnecessary luxuries are accorded to White children which in view of the priorities facing South Africa we should have to sacrifice for the benefit of the education of other people. This is not to suggest that there should be a lowering of educational standards at all, not by one jot or tittle. However, there are some luxuries which could be omitted for the benefit of everybody and directed to the education of Blacks.</p>

<p>There is for instance an urge for new universities for Whites in certain places. I do not believe that the Whites require any more universities in South Africa than already exist. The development of the existing universities, if there are more young men and women who require university training should by all means be encouraged. However, I very much doubt whether under all the circumstances we can in fact justify the establishment of new universities for Whites when there is so much else which requires attention, especially in the field of Black education.</p>
<p>In pursuance of the same principle I do believe that the hon. the Minister should accept assistance from every direction from which he can obtain it. We are perfectly aware of the fact that his predecessors seemed to take every opportunity of rejecting assistance from outside and sought not only to keep control but to be the only providers of education for Black people. They rejected the missionaries and they rejected White teachers and every possible offer to assist in educating Black people was rejected.</p>
<p>I met a very charming young lady the other day who teaches in Soweto. She found great inspiration in teaching Black children in Soweto. She found that they were so keen to learn that this gave her a sense of satisfaction, particularly after having taught White children who, by contrast, were not so well motivated as these Black children. In many cases there is a surplus of White teachers available in South Africa. I believe that the hon. the Minister should accept and encourage every White teacher he possibly can to come and help him in educating the Black children. This is a sphere in which I believe there are substantial untapped resources for the fulfilment of the objectives of this Bill.</p>
<p>There are a number of other voluntary organizations which seek to support education for Black people. There are business organizations, there are newspapers, missionaries and organizations of all types which seek to assist in the educational sphere. I am sure with a little encouragement many of the big organizations in South Africa will be very happy to provide some of the 7 000-odd classrooms the hon. the Minister requires in the near future. I am sure that many of these large corporations will be only too happy to assist if they are encouraged and given the opportunity. Therefore, in many spheres, provided the hon. the Minister gives the encouragement, he will find that almost all White organizations will be willing to help to the limit of their resources.</p>
<p>I am also very glad to note that the hon. the Minister is prepared to accept and in fact to seek foreign loans. This is a sphere in which again I am sure the hon. the Minister will enjoy a considerable measure of success, obviously with the proviso that our State will guarantee those loans. This is one sphere in fact where we may be able to attract a considerable amount of foreign capital, to the benefit of the economy as a whole. While foreign countries may not be willing to provide their capital in other spheres they may well be willing to provide that capital provided it is specifically directed towards education for Black people. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will do all within his power and with all the means at his disposal to carry the comments from this side of the House to his successor. I do not know when the hon. the Minister will be relinquishing the reins of office in this particular department but no doubt his successor will assume those reins in the near future. It is therefore the responsibility of this hon. Minister to transmit the essential points of this debate to his successor.</p>
<p>Finally, in a somewhat different vein, the hon. the Minister referred to his past as a dominee. Well, when one sees some of his colleagues I sometimes wonder whether in fact we are going to become a theocracy. We know that we are supposed to be a democracy whereas in fact we are an autocracy. The danger as I see it, is that we may in fact at times, I am very much afraid, become a kakistocracy.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I did not intend to take part in this debate at all and I do so only for one purpose. I should like to obtain certain information from the hon. the Minister arising out of some interesting remarks that he made. I refer in particular to the question of foreign loans, which I am very grateful for. I support this as much as my colleague the hon. Senator Henderson. I support all his sentiments as regards that point.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Henderson and myself, during the recent recess we had over the past couple of weeks, attended a function in Zululand when Chief Gatsha Buthelezi addressed us. I will say as little about that address as I possibly can and I think the hon. Senator Henderson knows the reason why. But one remark that Chief Buthelezi made was of particular significance in relation to the point that the hon. the Minister has made regarding foreign loans for the purpose of the advancement of Black education. He said that he wished to pay tribute to Great Britain. In particular he addressed his remarks to the British Minister who attended that particular function. He expressed the wish to have his remarks conveyed to the British ambassador. He said that a large sum of money&#x2014;and he did not mention the amount at the time&#x2014;had been granted, not as a loan but as a gift by the British Government to Black education. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will be able to advise us what that was because it is of interest to me and it might be of interest to others as well, in this context of money being provided from overseas for Black education.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am very pleased to hear of the finance we may possibly be able to obtain abroad and I hope full use will be made of it.</p>
<p>I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister to give as much help as possible to church schools at this stage. I think that this might also have a good effect on overseas institutions in granting us loans. I want to refer to the good work which my own church has done in this respect. Along the Olifants River, at the tip of Sekukuniland, I met Dr. Phatudi for the first time when he was being educated at our church school. Later he became a teacher and inspector of schools. I hope that at this stage we will encourage church schools for the very reason that education is so important.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to see that the principle of parental option is embodied in this Bill. In view of the fact that the hon. the Minister is now taking over another portfolio, I do not want him to be misled by the hon. Senator G. P. van den Berg. Our argument was in regard to the question of parental option. We should really take another look at White South Africa because I think the hon. Minister will concede that the education system for our Whites is aimed at bringing about one nation in South Africa. We have two official languages and I do not think anybody will argue with that.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I hope that this legislation will bring about a change in the attitude shown by President Mangope during their independence celebrations. On that occasion he used harsh words and I have already quoted them in the House. He said, <i>inter alia</i>, that he wanted to put it very clearly that one of the reasons why he had accepted independence for his country was &#x201C;to get away from the hated Bantu education which Pretoria claims is equal but which is not equal&#x201D;. I am pleased to note that the hon. the Minister is having discussions with these people and I hope that this legislation, and also the manner in which this hon. Minister has handled this portfolio, will help to change the attitude of President Mangope in this connection. He is also a product of my own church&#x2019;s school and it is to be regretted that he used those words which apparently were well-founded. I do hope therefore that this legislation will help to bring about a better relationship among all of us because I think that is absolutely necessary. Good human relations are very, very important in South Africa and in my view the hon. the Minister has done his share in promoting them while in charge of this portfolio.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I should like to express my thanks to the hon. Senator Du Toit, not only for his kind words but also for the suggestions he has made. I should like to reply briefly to his questions. As far as church schools are concerned, I should like in all fairness to leave the matter of further extensions which might be authorized in terms of this Bill, <i>inter alia</i>, the subsidy system and so on, to my successor to deal with. I do not want to bind him in any way to things for which I shall not be responsible.</p>
<p>When we talk of church schools, Sir, we must keep certain things in mind. A survey was made among the Black people in the Witbank township because various groups had asked for a site on which to build a church. It is hard to believe but there were 187 religious associations in the Black township of Witbank. When is a church a church and when is it not? The hon. Senator</p>
<p>Henderson spoke of theocracy and I am trying to get him to convert and become a Nationalist, although I cannot convert him to other ideas. But it will not help because there are some things no church can succeed in doing.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Crook spoke of the financing of schools in kwaZulu.</p>
<p>†It is a fact that not only in kwaZulu but also in the Transkei and Bophuthatswana especially, vast sums of money have been pumped into education by way of grants, free, gratis and for nothing. They do ask the permission of the Department of Plural Relations, but they are allowed to give these grants to the different homeland governments. Of course, we were not always keen on accepting these grants in White South Africa because of the fact that there are always strings attached. People come to us and say: I am prepared to donate R10 million on condition that you will build a school where both Whites and Blacks can attend. In other words, no segregation in schools, no apartheid, or whatever one wants to call it. This is however against the policy of the Government and therefore we could not allow it. This is also in reply to what the hon. Senator Henderson asked. We recently had a case where the American Chamber of Commerce asked for permission to build a school in Soweto. We have gone a long way towards finalizing this matter. There are only a few minor matters to be straightened out. With the sports fields that are envisaged and everything that has been planned, I think this will be something special. But we must at all times realize that not only must there be control over the standard of education, but sometimes also over the finances. We had cases, I regret to say, where people came forward with beautiful ideas, asking permission to give tuition to children free, gratis and for nothing. And at the end of the term one finds that they have been handed a slip of paper stating that they have passed Std. VI, while it was not worth a cent because they could not even pass St. I or grade I for that matter. There are ever so many people, I regret to say, who prey on these innocent people, and we have to stop that type of thing. Therefore schools will have to be registered and will have to be run along the lines laid down by my department.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator made a suggestion in regard to White teachers. Sir, it is such a delicate field when one starts negotiating. The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers will perhaps be able to tell hon. Senators that in Soweto, when we appointed a White principal because he was so well qualified and had a love for the work and was prepared to risk his life to teach in Soweto, there was an outcry against his appointment over a Black. We cannot get away from it There is forever people sowing suspicion, no matter what one does. One can never be right.</p>

<p>Yes, there is nothing to stop it from being done. It can be done. We still have over 300 White teachers teaching in our schools for Blacks, but we are now using more and more White teachers for the upgrading of the qualification of teachers. I think that is where it is needed most, and we are looking forward to getting more of this type of assistance later. I agree fully that sometimes we have to accept outside help. In this regard the Urban Foundation and the Teach Fund have been of considerable assistance. To hon. Senators in Natal I can mention that they have an organization there called &#x201C;Operation Upgrade&#x201D;, which is run by a Mr. D&#x2019;Oliviera. Unfortunately, I believe that his wife is suffering from an incurable disease and is dying. But despite this fact, this missionary comes over from America for six months of the year to work among adult Blacks in South Africa and to at least teach them literacy. We get this type of assistance and, in turn, we give assistance where we can. I can say without fear of contradiction that there is a great deal of interest in the field of education.</p>
<p>I am very pleased that we have my senior colleague here, the hon. the Minister of Finance. He has been ever so kind to my Department and I have no doubt that he will continue to be so in future.</p>

<p>Section 21(1) of the Financial Relations Act, 1976, empowers a provincial council to make provision, <i>inter alia</i>, for the payment from the provincial revenue fund of an amount required for the defraying of expenditure incurred within the province in connection with a matter of national interest.</p>
<p>Section 21(2) of the Act defines a matter of national interest as any act, event, granting of aid, ceremony or demonstration declared by the Minister of the Interior and Immigration to be a matter of national interest on the ground that it is calculated, <i>inter alia</i>, to promote religion, patriotism, education, physical or human sciences, culture, sport or national security.</p>
<p>As hon. Senators know, 1979 has been proclaimed to be Health Year. The provinces play a prominent part in the provision of health services and will of necessity therefore incur direct expenditure in some way or other in connection with the project. Since the provinces do not have the power to incur expenditure in relation to a matter such as a Health Year, a request has been made that the project be declared a matter of national interest in terms of section 21. However, the State law advisers are of the opinion that Health Year, 1979, cannot be included under any of the matters specified in section 21(2).</p>
<p>In order to vest the Minister of the Interior and Immigration with the necessary power to declare such an important project to be a matter of national interest it is being proposed in the Bill that the word &#x201C;health&#x201D; be inserted after the words &#x201C;physical or human sciences&#x201D; in the said section 21(2). It may be accepted that the provinces have already taken steps in regard to the matter, and consequently it is also being proposed that the statutory amendments shall be with retrospective effect.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the Health Year. As hon. Senators know I produce red meat which is naturally an important ingredient in the diet of any healthy person. Naturally I also like the red wine which some people produce here in the Western Cape. I want to say, however, that the central Government is making a very valuable contribution, especially in the Transvaal. I do hope, however, that seeing that we on the borders of the Transvaal are protecting the people on the other side of the Liesbeek River &#x2026;</p>

<p>I shall tell that hon. Senator in a moment what we intend doing with the Free State. I only hope that the additional financial assistance that the Transvaal is to receive will not lead to the money which has been voted for national security, namely, the building of roads, becoming an issue. I am sure the hon. the Minister of Finance has a great deal of money that he can make available to the Transvaal so he can make an adequate amount available for these two projects, namely the Health Year and national security. I trust that the hon. the Deputy Minister will use his influence, in spite of the fact that he hails from the Cape Province, to ensure that the Transvaal receives its rightful share in respect of these two matters.</p>

<p>Mr. President, had the hon. Senator Du Toit not spoken, I could have replied very briefly. I want firstly to tell hon. Senators that I am very pleased that they support such a positive measure as this. We all agree that the provinces are the bodies that play a decisive role today in providing health services and that we would be making a serious mistake if we did not see to it that they had the necessary means at their disposal to play their rightful part in promoting the Health Year 1979. However, I want to tell the hon. Senator Du Toit immediately that that does not mean that the State is going to provide the provinces with money for this purpose. On the contrary. This legislation provides that the provinces are to be allowed to use money from the Provincial Revenue Fund in order to participate in the Health Year. Because most of the funds of the provinces are supplied by the Treasury, it is necessary for the Treasury and the State has to lay down certain guidelines in regard to how the money is to be spent. The Government law adviser informs us that in terms of the Financial Relations Act the provinces will not be able to spend money from those funds for this purpose. The Act has first to be amended and provision has to be made enabling them to spend money for that purpose. All I am asking here is that the provinces be allowed to use some of their own money in order to participate in this project.</p>

<p>Here is another Senator from the Cape Province talking. He knows nothing about what is happening beyond the Liesbeek. This is not a matter of provincialism but if certain services have already been budgeted for, some of the amounts allocated will most probably have to be pruned in order to contribute money for the Health Year. Naturally the provinces are making a very, very valuable contribution but this may cause difficulty. That is why I ask in anticipation of that happening whether the hon. the Deputy Minister could use his influence so that they will receive a little extra.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I want to tell the hon. Senator Du Toit that preparations for this Health Year started last year. The provinces knew of this a long time ago; they planned for it and in fact they budgeted for it. They have made ample provision for it so that they can play their rightful part. When the matter was raised at the beginning of the year it was doubtful whether they could, within the framework of existing legislation, utilize the money they had earmarked in their budgets for that purpose. The matter was referred to the Government law adviser and it was recommended that the whole matter be placed beyond any doubt. I can assure the hon. Senator that it will not be necessary for the provinces to change their budgets at this stage. As a matter of fact they have already spent the money they have voted for this purpose. What we are doing in fact is to legalize what the provinces have done with retrospective effect.</p>

<p>(Second Reading)</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>I trust that you will allow me to make a few introductory remarks before I proceed to deal with the Bill.</p>
<p>The present Industrial Conciliation Act still contains, in broad outline, the principles laid down in the Conciliation Act of 1924, with important changes, of course, which have been made at various stages. One can proudly state, therefore, that this Act, as well as our other labour legislation up to now, has functioned very well indeed and has made a major contribution to the industrial peace we have enjoyed over the years. As hon. Senators know, the Conciliation Act regulates the registration of trade unions, employers&#x2019; organizations and industrial councils. It also regulates the activities of the existing industrial tribunal and the settling of industrial disputes. It also contains provisions relating to freedom of association and the protection workers are afforded by job reservation.</p>
<p>The most important part of the Act, i.e. the registration of trade unions, is not applicable to Blacks. Consequently a dual system is in operation. A separate mechanism has been created for Blacks as far as the negotiation of conditions of service is concerned, namely the Black Labour Relations Regulation Act. Therefore we have the co-existence, in one economic framework, of an industrial council system for Whites and coloured persons, the success of which has been proved over the years by the responsible conduct of the 174 trade unions and 243 employers&#x2019; organizations, as well as the 2 552 liaison and 305 works committees on the entrepreneurial level for Blacks.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also a third system of wage regulation, the wage board system, in terms of which a statutory body makes recommendations concerning conditions of service with regard to all population groups.</p>
<p>Over the years, changes have been made to our labour legislation but events and developments in all fields and in the field of labour in particular, have been rapid over the past two decades. South Africa could not and has not escaped this. Shortly after I became Minister of Labour, I realized that matters in the labour field were developing in a direction which justified action. Evidence which reached me along various channels indicated that events, internal as well as external, in the political and economic spheres, had been of such a drastic and dramatic nature that the Government could not wait until evolutionary changes were forced upon it. I sensed that the time for reactive conduct was past and that we would henceforth have to take preventive action or we would lose the initiative with regard to timely and essential changes and adjustments to our system and to the legislation.</p>
<p>I had the feeling that I should prepare a comprehensive account and make an in-depth analysis of the developments as soon as possible for myself and for the country, so that the Government would be able to keep its finger on the pulse of the country&#x2019;s labour dispensation.</p>
<p>To confirm my suppositions, I recommended in June 1977 that a commission of inquiry be appointed with the widest possible terms of reference, not only to examine all the laws administered by the Department of Labour but also to analyse the whole labour set-up in its widest context to ascertain what the factual situation was and to make recommendations concerning the changes that should be made.</p>
<p>The total statutory and institutional dispensation which is envisaged by the commission, the essential features of which have been accepted by the Government, will of necessity require a considerable time for its full implementation. Patient construction is required, and the provision of the necessary statutory provisions is only one aspect of it Consequently, the Government has seen fit to make only a few amendments to the existing Industrial Conciliation Act for the time being, so as not to delay essential changes. The Bill which is now before the House gives effect to this approach. I have tabled an explanatory memorandum and I should now like to explain in greater detail the most important proposed amendments.</p>
<p>Clause 1 contains several new definitions, and the most important of these is the new definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D;. As hon. Senators know, Black workers are presently excluded from the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D;. Legally speaking, therefore, they cannot be organized into registered trade unions and cannot have representation on industrial councils. The negotiating procedures of industrial councils are barred to them and they can only make use of the &#x201C;committee system&#x201D; under the Black Labour Relations Regulation Act and can only negotiate in general terms with regard to a specific enterprise. In practice, however, several sections of the existing Industrial Conciliation Act have been applied to Blacks since 1924. In this way, most industrial council agreements laying down wages and other conditions of service are extended to the Blacks to prevent unfair competition.</p>
<p>The Government has decided that only certain workers will be admitted to trade unions. Consequently the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; is being amended to provide for this. Only persons who have the right to reside permanently in South Africa and who have permanent jobs are regarded as employees for the purposes of the Act. Migrant labourers and border commuters are excluded. I have already given a definition of such workers in the explanatory memorandum. I should like to draw hon. Senators&#x2019; attention to the fact that I do have the power to declare any person to be an employee for the purposes of the Act, and I have already received representations from organizations which foresee problems in certain areas. Therefore I am well aware of the fact that there are quite a number of problems in this connection, problems which will have to be sorted out It is also clear to me that certain commuters will have to be accommodated. I therefore intend to have the matter investigated at once and to make changes in this connection in due course. As you know, I have publicly expressed the opinion that I shall have to make concessions to accommodate commuters in certain areas and industries in terms of the powers conferred upon me by the legislation under discussion.</p>
<p>I do want to point out, though, that the large numbers of commuters and migrant workers from homelands and independent Black States are not completely without protection. They can still make use of the committee system in terms of the Black Labour Relations Regulation Act, as they have in the past. Furthermore, I want to point out that industrial council agreements laying down wages and other conditions of service, such as hours of work, leave, sick-leave, etc., have in the past been extended to cover all workers, including commuters and migrant workers, and this will also be the case in the future. After all, we shall not lay down separate wages for such workers. If we did that, we would have chaos on the shop floors.</p>
<p>Another matter I want to make quite clear is that farm labourers and domestic servants have been excluded from the Conciliation Act and other industrial laws since 1924. Only in 1965 did we include farm labourers under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. In previous reports, the commissions concerned argued that it would be extremely difficult to make industrial legislation applicable to farm labourers and domestic servants because circumstances differ from farm to farm and from province to province. However, I do not want to say any more about this matter because the Wiehahn Commission still has to report on it.</p>
<p>I should now like to deal with clause 2. It concerns the proposed National Manpower Commission. The commission&#x2014;I am now referring to the present commission&#x2014;refers to the development, in the economic and social spheres in particular, which is making increasing demands of the State. This development is taking place at such a rapid pace these days that labour policy and possible legislation will have to be reviewed at shorter intervals. The role of the State with regard to future planning, rationalization and development of manpower to fit into the economic pattern is becoming increasingly important. The internationalization of labour, especially in the context of the Southern African dispensation, will increasingly involve me as Minister and my department in the international labour world. The recruitment, development and utilization of manpower from outside our borders is assuming ever greater significance and must certainly be connected with internal unemployment and the creation of job opportunities on a priority basis. As Senators know, more and more people are advocating better utilization of local labour in certain sectors of the economic system.</p>
<p><i>Ad hoc</i> commissions, such as the Naudé Commission, which were appointed in the past, will in my opinion no longer fit into the future planning and will not be the proper method of identifying tendencies. A standing body which will have to review the whole labour set-up on an on-going basis, and which will watch developments and tendencies so that adjustments may be made in time, is essential.</p>
<p>The Government is thoroughly aware of the structural changes in the country&#x2019;s economy, technological developments and political events in and around our country&#x2019;s borders. In the light of this, vigilance, purposeful preparedness and greater flexibility will be required in policy formulation, in planning and in conduct. The labour set-up and developments will have to be continually monitored and tested. We simply cannot allow our policy and legislation to lag behind practical developments any longer. We have only to look at the growth in the economically active population and its composition to identify the rapidly changing pattern.</p>
<p>In 1960, the economically active population consisted of 1,1 million Whites, 551 000 Coloureds, 125 000 Asians and 4,3 million Blacks. In 1978, the figures were: 1,8 million Whites, 836 000 Coloureds, 244 000 Asians and 6,3 million Blacks. In the case of the Whites, therefore, there was a growth of 700 000; in the case of the Coloureds it was 285 000; in the case of the Asians, 119 000; and in the case of the Blacks, 2 million; a total increase of 3 million over this short period.</p>
<p>According to the latest manpower survey of the Department of Labour in 1977 at a time of economic depression&#x2014;and we should bear in mind that this was during a period of low conjuncture, a time of serious recession&#x2014;there were already considerable labour shortages in certain sectors. The point I want to make is that if we had shortages during a recession, how much greater would those shortages not be when we moved out of the recession into a renewed upswing. Even then there was a shortage of more than 12 000 Whites in the professional occupations, more than 4 000 in the clerical occupations, more than 8 000 in transport and communications and more than 9 000 artisans. It is expected that these shortages will grow if we have an economic revival, and therefore it is of the utmost importance that we should have a standing body which is able to review our labour requirements on a regular basis. Therefore the Government accepts the commission&#x2019;s recommendation for the establishment of a National Manpower Commission which will have to give the Government well-researched and well-motivated advice on an on-going basis so that quick and effective action may be taken to meet our labour requirements if there is an economic revival. In the light of its composition, which includes representatives of employers and employees, the National Manpower Commission will naturally play an important role in the implementation of the recommendations of the commission which are accepted by the Government. I believe that there will have to be the closest possible liaison between the National Manpower Commission and the present commission so that the fullest co-operation between organized employers&#x2019; and employees&#x2019; organizations may be ensured. The objective is to give a say to a diversity of persons and bodies. Because it will not be possible initially to give all interested groups representation on the National Manpower Commission, I intend to designate additional members for specific tasks and problems which may arise.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to point out that the National Manpower Commission will maintain the closest co-operation with all Government departments. The research function of the National Manpower Commission will be on a different level from that of the Human Sciences Research Council and of universities. Its research will be more practical and orientated towards the process of policy formulation. Therefore the National Manpower Commission will actually be supplementary to the activities of other bodies which concentrate more specifically on particular research projects. I am convinced that the National Manpower Commission will be a body on whose shoulders a great national responsibility will rest. I trust that all parties will make contributions when consultations are held about specific problems and hitches, not only by way of isolated memoranda, but continuously.</p>
<p>Clause 3 of the Bill deals mainly with the registration of trade unions. As I have already said, Black workers are presently excluded from the Act For this reason, Black trade unions cannot legally register and therefore cannot have representation on industrial councils. Therefore they do not form part of the bargaining process on that level. There has been intense overseas interest lately in our trade unionism, especially with regard to Black workers. This process is taking place by means of foreign pressure groups as well as certain labour codes drawn up by overseas countries for subsidiary companies in South Africa. The existing 27 Black trade unions and their approximately 50 000 members, which are not statutorily prohibited, already exist in some key industries and receive considerable financial and moral support from overseas. These Black trade unions exist alongside the three statutory systems, i.e. the industrial council system, the committee system and the wage board system, so they can enter into agreements outside these systems with individual employers on an entrepreneurial level, thereby subverting the existing systems. This system enjoys strong foreign support. The international trade union movement already has training centres in some of our neighbouring States for training Blacks as trade union leaders. Many South African Black trade union members are being trained abroad and many overseas trade union leaders have been visiting the Republic in recent years to observe and promote trade union activities in this country and to provide organizational assistance. Over the past 18 months, more than 60 people have visited the Republic from the United States, Holland, Sweden, Italy and Britain. South African Blacks have visited countries such as the United States, Britain and Holland to make a study of trade unionism and to obtain contacts so that the local trade unions may affiliate with the overseas unions. These Blacks from South Africa have been financed mainly by foreign bodies.</p>
<p>The existing Black trade unions are not at the moment subject to any legal requirements and therefore find themselves in a more favourable position than the registered trade unions, one reason being that there is no control over their money and it can therefore be used as they see fit, and is of course often channelled in directions which have nothing to do with conditions of service, which is the primary concern of trade unionism.</p>
<p>The extension of statutory trade union rights to Black workers can therefore have far-reaching implications for this country, and in accepting the commission&#x2019;s recommendations on this point, the Government does not intend to open up the system altogether from the start. For this reason, the Government has not fully accepted either the majority or the minority standpoint of the commission, but has decided that in the future, only workers of all races who have permanent jobs and who are permanently resident in this country will qualify for trade union membership. I want to emphasize that this restriction will apply to all population groups. The reason why the distinction cannot be made on any other basis is that other criteria, such as nationality, level of occupation, industrial orientation, etc., are creating many problems elsewhere in the world. The basis of permanent residence and permanent employment is relatively speaking the fairest one for the South African dispensation at the present time and against the background of the political and constitutional developments to come. However, I want to emphasize that the proposed amendment empowers the Minister to bring within the ambit of the legislation, by means of a notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, certain groups of workers that are not initially entitled to automatic trade union membership. This will be done with due regard for all the relevant interests of all the parties and also with regard to security and the maintenance of industrial peace in this country.</p>
<p>It must be accepted that workers who come from a country with an alien ideology will naturally be treated differently or be admitted on other and stricter conditions than those from a friendly country. I will certainly not allow our trade union movement to be abused or used for purposes which may endanger the county. In the light of our geographic situation and constitutional dispensation, there may be independent States, or such States may come into being, which will not allow their citizens to be members of South African trade unions in any case, of which we have already had indications.</p>
<p>In clause 4, provision is made for the principle of provisional registration of employers&#x2019; organizations and trade unions, which is an important provision. The principle of provisional registration is not unusual. Even a country such as England subscribes to such a system. Provisional registration will enable the industrial registrar to prescribe conditions and a period of time before an employers&#x2019; organization or a trade union can obtain final registration. As against this, provisional registration will confer a higher status and recognition upon the employers&#x2019; organization or trade union concerned, which will facilitate the recruitment of members, and will also promote attempts to obtain the co-operation of employers in such a campaign. The Government accepts the commission&#x2019;s recommendation that provisional registration should be a prerequisite before a trade union or employers&#x2019; organization can begin a recruitment campaign. The Government is counting on the co-operation of all parties in this connection. To ensure order and to avoid administrative problems, the registration of persons who do not qualify for trade union membership is prohibited.</p>
<p>In clause 6, provision is made for the extension of the prohibition on participation by employers&#x2019; organizations and trade unions in political activities and the support of political parties and candidates. The Government is only too aware of the dangers which possible participation by labour organizations in politics may hold for the country. There are many examples elsewhere in the world of situations where pressure groups have developed and impeded economic stability. The Republic is too vulnerable today to allow an intermingling of labour relations and politics. Therefore the prohibition in this connection is being extended by including all bodies established as legislative bodies in the future.</p>
<p>Clause 8 provides for the establishment of an industrial court, consisting of a president, who will be a senior jurist The Government believes that a person with the qualifications and experience required by the clause will greatly enhance the status of the court</p>
<p>The Government expects great things of the new industrial court as a body which will see that justice is done in labour disputes and which will serve as an important protective mechanism for individual workers in cases where their security is threatened in an illegitimate way. From its administration of justice, a so-called fair and equitable labour code should develop as soon as possible to serve as a guideline for the country. Therefore the Government foresees that the court procedure should be fairly informal and simple; that litigation costs should be kept down; that the court should be as accessible as possible to everyone; and that the rulings of the court should be on the basis of fairness, taking into consideration the socio-economic and socio-political implications of the matters that are submitted to it.</p>
<p>The provisions which authorize the president of the court to appoint assessors, after consultation with the employer and employee parties involved in a specific dispute, will ensure that all aspects of disputes will be assessed in a competent and equitable way. It is not necessary to motivate this any further. It is obvious from the fact that the use of assessors is a well-known and established practice in our courts.</p>
<p>The judicial function is of a civil nature and covers a wide spectrum of the normal functions of our civil courts. At this stage, the court is not given any criminal jurisdiction, since the proposed informal procedure of the court is not suited to criminal cases and our criminal law sets exacting requirements with regard to criminal liability.</p>
<p>Clauses 10 and 11 are intended to incorporate certain protective measures in respect of rights of minority groups on an industrial council. It may happen that a particular party may outnumber some other party on the industrial council. The Government cannot be indifferent to such a possibility, because the maintenance of industrial peace remains a top priority to the Government. Over the years, industrial councils have acted responsibly, and I cannot imagine that they will fail to do so in the future. Nor can I imagine that the industrial councils would act wilfully and refuse to allow responsible parties. The amendment is not aimed at certain races, but at all races.</p>
<p>Clause 10 provides, therefore, that before any new parties are admitted to an industrial council in the future, all the parties will have to give their written consent. However, in the Other Place I accepted an amendment in terms of which an aggrieved party will have a right of appeal to the Industrial Court if he is not admitted. Where disputes arise about the changing of labour practices, the industrial councils will also have to be unanimous in their decisions before such changes are effected. If no unanimity exists the matter will have to be referred to the Industrial Court. This amendment is contained in clause 11. The principle of a veto in decisionmaking bodies of a heterogeneous composition is not unknown. Until such time as the new dispensation has been established, it will be necessary to incorporate protective measures at various levels in the new system in order to ensure that the interests of minority groups on the industrial level are properly entrenched. I trust that future development will be so orderly and evolutionary that it will seldom be necessary to use the veto.</p>
<p>Clauses 13 and 14 are actually connected with the repeal of section 77 of the existing Act, i.e. the present job reservation provisions. Section 43 of the present Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a worker may appeal to the Minister to intervene where an employer changes his conditions of employment or suspends or terminates his employment. If the Minister decides to intervene, he may order the employer not to change the worker&#x2019;s conditions of service or terminate his services or suspend him. This provision is now being extended so that the Minister will also be able to act where, for example, employers change traditional labour practices and replace or dismiss workers without the matter having been considered by the industrial councils or agreement having been reached between the parties concerning a labour practice. Where industrial councils exist, such disputes will first have to be considered by the industrial council, and if the council cannot settle the dispute, it will have to be referred to the industrial court, and this court will then have to give a final ruling. If the court supports the workers, it will have to make a final determination, which will then prohibit the employer from changing the conditions of service.</p>
<p>I should like to appeal to our employers today not to exploit the new dispensation. I trust that changes in established labour practices, if these are essential, will be brought about in an orderly manner and with the co-operation of all the parties, and that it will not be necessary for me to give effect to the statutory protective measures which are now being incorporated in the legislation.</p>
<p>As I have already said, the Government does not wish at this stage to implement all the amendments arising from the Wiehahn report, but it first wants to evaluate the development of the new dispensation after the initial amendments, and also to consider what further statutory amendments may be called for.</p>
<p>South Africa is indeed on the eve of a new dispensation in its labour history&#x2014;a dispensation in its dispensation in its labour history&#x2014;a dispensation which, if it is regulated with wisdom and insight by the authorities, if it is anticipated in a spirit of co-operation by all parties in the field of industrial relations, holds great promise for the future. As I mentioned briefly, these changes are absolutely essential in the times in which we live. A country which is not prepared to provide for effective mobility in accordance with the requirements of the times is running the danger, in its rigidity, of losing the things to which it clings so desperately. Our survival requires initiative and movement&#x2014;our growth and development require faith and confidence. Therefore we must tackle with both hands the challenges which the future holds. For these reasons, I trust that this amending legislation will be supported by the whole House.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, at this stage I should like to ask the privilege of the hour, although I shall perhaps not make full use of it.</p>
<p>I am very pleased with the explanation the hon. the Minister has given us. The hon. the Minister is correct to a large extent, viz. that many of the principles contained in the 1924 legislation were taken over in the 1937 legislation and again in the 1956 legislation. The Bill now before the House also contains many of the original provisions. It is to be regretted, but at the time our country was not so developed. It took the 1922 strike to bring the Government to its senses and the Industrial Conciliation Act was introduced. This is an Act of which we have always been very proud and which has really contributed greatly to the elimination of strikes and trouble. Furthermore, it is one of the laws that has done much to bring about good labour relations. The period of Hoggenheimer and the oppressed worker was past and as time went on, the workers and employers acted together so that both sectors played a very important role in the economy. Everybody put the economy of the counter first.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the prohibition in the 1924 and successive legislation was to the detriment of Black labour relations and in my view it was specifically because of this prohibition that employees and employers could not freely take decisions for themselves. I think in the period we are now entering we shall have to realize that people must be given more freedom to decide for themselves so that better relations can be built up. I shall deal later with the disadvantages of the legal prohibition that has been placed on certain people.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has explained what further opportunities there are for the settlement of disputes. We know that the Wage Board has done very important work in this connection, especially among unorganized groups, and it is continuing to do this. The only problem as far as the Wage Board is concerned is that they cannot act quickly enough, and I think this can be ascribed to the fact that they are overloaded with work They do not have the necessary staff and they cannot arrange to do all the work at once, with the result that some of the Wage Board determinations are very old. This period has been reduced. There were times when some of them were 15 years old. The period has gradually decreased although there are still some of these determinations which are seven years old and more. Under the present circumstances, and in view of the cost of living which they have to contend with, the workers cannot wait too long. In my opinion reviews should take place every three years.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister is quite right when he says that there must be revolutionary adjustments. I think that is the reason why the Wiehahn report was so well received by employers and employees of all races. There have even been favourable comments from overseas about the report because the report recommended that many of the things which caused irritation in the past should be done away with. The report has definitely done something good for South Africa. I shall deal with the disappointing aspects later on in my speech. I shall also deal with the definitions later and with the position of permanent employees. I am very pleased that the hon. the Minister gave the assurance that an investigation would be made into the position of the commuters and migrant labourers. This is one of the utmost importance and I shall deal further with this later in my speech.</p>
<p>The committee system has served a good purpose but as I said on a previous occasion in this hon. House, this system has not really been adequate. There were court cases. Agreements were reached between the works committees and the other committees and the employers as well as the liaison committees and the employers. But if the agreements were not implemented the only recourse a worker had was to institute civil action against the employer. The worker was not financially in a position to do this. In future the Industrial Court will play a very important role in this connection.</p>
<p>As far as the National Manpower Commission is concerned, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that this is a big step forward. I think it was in 1967 or 1968 that I suggested to Dr. Rautenbach that we had to know what our requirements were. The Government had to appoint a committee consisting of employers and employees to go into the matter and to decide precisely what we needed. Because of the prohibition which operated in the past, our economy was most detrimentally affected and we cannot afford this any longer.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister quoted very important figures in regard to growth in the sphere of labour. Employment in respect of all race groups has increased. But each of us connected with the economy, industry and commerce knows that highly skilled labour is very scarce at present. Although as a small White population we should like to keep everything for ourselves&#x2014;of course, I do not believe in this; I believe that the whole population must share in the economy&#x2014;we must realize that we shall not be able to provide the necessary skilled manpower for all time for the Public Service, the Defence Force and so on. I think only a stupid person&#x2014;to be quite blunt&#x2014;could cherish that sort of idea these days. We shall have to make full use of our labour forces; we must learn that people must be employed on merit and that they must be paid according to the work they do. If the Whites want to work, I think they will always be able to hold their own because they very definitely have a big advantage over the other race groups.</p>
<p>I like the composition of this Manpower Commission. The commission will consist of public servants, employees and employers. All important groups will therefore be represented on the commission. I welcome the suggestion that assessors may be appointed. They can advise the commission in regard to the relevant industry which the commission might be dealing with at any specific time because it is impossible for one commission to have knowledge of all the different industries in the country.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister is quite right when he says that the world today is showing greater interest in the worker&#x2019;s position in this country, especially the Black worker, than it did in the past. Many people have also visited this country. Some of my colleagues in the trade union with which I am connected and I, have taken these visitors round, and it has meant a great breakthrough for South Africa. We had one person here in January. He not only took photographs of the factories and the people working there but also of the housing schemes etc. When at a later stage he addressed certain groups in England, Belgium and other countries, they told him he was talking rubbish. He then told them that he could prove everything he said because he had himself taken photographs which he could show them. It made a wonderful impression on those people. I have heard again today from somebody who has come back from overseas that it is unbelievable how the attitude of certain people has changed since they have heard from their own people that things are not what the anti-apartheid movement and others say they are. It is important therefore not only that South African trade union leaders should attend congresses and explain what the true position is but that people should come here from overseas and see for themselves what is going on. Numerous students from various countries have come to me to make inquiries in regard to their theses about South Africa in which the trade union movement has played a very important role. We are not the tiny country we might think we are. We are part of the world. But as long as we do not put our house in order we shall not be able to convince the rest of the world that they should accept it. Labour is one of the most important matters. In the business world we are doing a lot of good for people, but all that good work can be undone by unhealthy labour relations if we carry on as we are at present.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister said there was no control over the finances of these people. The hon. the Minister referred to certain trade unions which went about things in a certain way. They do not follow the acknowledged methods, methods in terms of which some of us try to educate the Black trade unions so that they can act responsibly. As far as the clothing workers&#x2019; trade union is concerned, they have helped to organize the Black workers and today this is the largest Black trade union in South Africa. They act very responsibly and there is regular discussion between ourselves and themselves. They ask us regularly for advice. This is of the utmost importance. People from the former Department of Information used to &#x2019;phone me to ask whether I could arrange to explain matters to them and also address the Black trade union representatives. We were like a shop window because this was a trade union which acted responsibly. But we do know that there are certain persons who played a big role in the 1973 strikes. Those people did not develop locally. They were not organized and developed locally. Nobody helped them. Other people came from outside and helped them with money obtained overseas. The Black Trade union of the clothing industry has never received money from overseas because they know that they can always get help through the existing trade union. Within a short time they were financially independent and they could carry on on their own. In my view that is a very important matter which the Manpower Commission must investigate in order to determine which is the best way to act. I want to put it on record that the healthiest trade union and the healthiest relations will be found where the registered trade union and the Black trade union work together. They must decide how they want to do it. If that happens, we shall see that we shall be able to train very sound Black trade unions here which will act responsibly.</p>
<p>As far as nationalities are concerned, I can assure the hon. the Minister that in this connection we have experienced no problems in respect of the Black trade union which has been in existence now for 30 years and has grown into a large trade union. They work together and everybody is told: &#x201C;Look, political opinions are not tolerated in the trade union; this trade union works for the welfare of the workers and tries to improve their living standards.&#x201D; In that way everybody has followed the right line of thought and things have gone smoothly with the result that there are no politics in the trade union. The people who have tried to introduce politics have been thrown out surprisingly quickly. These workers knew what it meant to belong to a trade union, to work with the registered trade union and to be on good terms with them.</p>
<p>I am not opposed to preliminary registration. I am totally in favour of preliminary registration. But what is not clear to me, especially since the hon. the Minister has spoken, is how preliminary registration will take place. In the past the workers first had to be organized and they had to be representative before the trade union could obtain registration. Now it seems to be the other way round because the hon. the Minister said they cannot recruit before they have obtained preliminary registration. I find this totally lacking in clarity. Can anybody now say to the Registrar: &#x201C;Mr. Registrar, I want to make application; here is my constitution to organize workers in this or that trade union?&#x201D; I really cannot see how that will work. It will mean absolute chaos because, as we say, every Tom, Dick and Harry will now probably want to organize a trade union. He does not have the support of the workers. He can produce no proof. One does not even know if he will mislead the workers. He will say: &#x201C;I am registered, come to me.&#x201D; There is no committee which takes decisions. The workers in general have not taken a decision that they want a trade union. I hope the hon. the Minister will explain the preliminary registration which is to be effected in this way. I find it something quite foreign to the trade union movement, however. From 1924 the position has always been that one had first to organize the workers. One had to prove that one was representative of that industry, who one&#x2019;s committee members were, what their home addresses were etc., and that one&#x2019;s constitution and finances were all in order before one obtained registration. I want to repeat that I am not opposed to preliminary registration. Perhaps it is necessary for a certain period but it must be done in a proper way and not in the way the hon. the Minister has set it out here. It is something quite foreign to me. It will introduce a totally new principle into industrial legislation.</p>
<p>I also welcome the establishment of the Industrial Court. I appreciate the fact that it will be cheap and accessible to all persons. If assessors are appointed, they can receive assistance if they are not <i>au fait</i> with the technical side of a particular industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the protection of industrial groups and the fact that they can go to court if they think they have been unfairly treated, I think this is quite right because we do not think employers should have the right to act recklessly and pay off workers unfairly if they do not have a case against them. I just want to tell the hon. the Minister that at a later stage in my speech I shall speak about the majority on the industrial council and so on.</p>
<p>The position is here that one is weakening the council&#x2019;s ability to settle a matter and taking up the time of the court unnecessarily. So many disputes are settled by the industrial council to the satisfaction of all concerned. But to expect that one will always have 100%, is not possible. For that reason I am a great champion of the two-thirds majority. If a two-thirds majority is sufficient in this Upper House to change the Constitution, a decision of the industrial council surely calls for no more than a two-thirds majority. That is why it must be unanimous. It is not always possible to have a 100% unanimous decision. One sometimes finds obstreperous people on a council like this and they refuse to deviate from their standpoint. If a two-thirds majority is called for and is present, then the matter is resolved. If a two-thirds majority votes for the worker with a grievance and the others vote against him, that person still has to go to the Industrial Council for a decision. In my view that is quite unnecessary.</p>
<p>As far as the right of veto in the clause concerning the trade unions is concerned, I am very pleased about the amendment that has been effected but I do not really like it. I think here too there should be a two-thirds majority who will decide. This will leave a very bad taste and it looks as if one only wants to play cat and mouse with the Black workers. If there are some hostile trade union members they can keep Black workers off the industrial council for all time. In my opinion that is unfair and in this way we are not doing away with discrimination. I think there should be protection for minority groups. The one group should not be able to outvote the other. One group should not comprise the majority of the employees. In my view that is not a very good thing. Minority groups must be protected.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, I believe in the principle of parity.</p>
<p>The last point to which the hon. Minister referred is one in connection with efficiency and we trust that everything will contribute to greater efficiency. But I do feel that the hon. the Minister has received representations which indicate that a large number of organizations and people are very disappointed with the legislation that has resulted from the outstanding report of the Wiehahn Commission.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, after the report of the Wiehahn Commission on labour legislation I must say that the draft legislation is a great disappointment to us. The continuous enforcement of the separation of workers in the different race groups will be construed as interference with the freedom of association. In this regard I would like to read to you now, Sir, what the commission has reported, and afterwards what is envisaged in this Bill. This refers to freedom of association, which means the definition of employee as far as membership of a trade union is concerned. The Commission recommends&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; both trade union organizations and individuals should be afforded full freedom of association in that eligible individuals should be free to join any appropriate union of their choice, and that unions should be free to admit to a bar from their ranks any such individuals, whether or not race, colour or sex is a consideration; and that any trade union that meets the requirements for registration in the restructured system should, irrespective of the colour, race or sex of its members, be eligible for registration and full participation in the bargaining and dispute prevention and settlement machinery provided for in a statute common to all.</block>
<p>I am 100% in favour of this recommendation of the Commission. I think it is a first-class suggestion. In this way we will be doing away with discrimination and yet we leave the choice to the workers themselves. I am definitely not in favour of people compelling workers to come together if the workers themselves are not in favour of it. I feel it must be left to the workers to decide whether they want a mixed trade union or separate trade unions, provided that if a trade union turns away a group of workers, whether they be Coloured, Indian or Black, that union should not have the right to stand in their way to bargain collectively on the industrial council if they have their own trade union. They have as much right as we have to speak for themselves.</p>
<p>In regard to this matter &#x201C;employee&#x201D; in this Bill means&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">(a) any person&#x2014;<br/>(i) who is employed by or working for any employer and receiving or entitled to receive any remuneration, and any other person whatsoever who in any manner assists in the carrying on or conducting of the business of an employer; &#x2026;</block>
<p>With that provision I find no fault, but it continues&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">(ii) who may legally reside on land in the Republic of South Africa, but excluding any person who resides on land as contemplated in section 21(1) of the Development Trust and Land Act, 1936 (Act No. 18 of 1936), or any land within a territory which in terms of any other law is a self-governing territory within the Republic of South Africa, as well as any person who enters the Republic for the purpose of carrying out a contract &#x2026;</block>
<p>I am not going to quote this definition further because at the moment I am not going to plead for workers who enter the Republic on a contract basis from Mozambique, Botswana, Malawi, Zambia or any of these countries. They have never been part of South Africa. But where the workers come from states which formerly were part of South Africa, I feel we should treat them differently. One could even draw a distinction in respect of the independent states in South Africa, but to leave out the people from self-governing states that are not independent and prevent them from joining trade union movements will, I feel, cause a great deal of trouble and chaos.</p>
<p>We know that there are many workers who have permission to work in the Republic but do not have rights under section 10 of the Urban Areas Act. In my view there should be no prohibition as far as these workers are concerned because employers are free to employ them. The Minister is given a discretion, but I feel that if one has that right onee would like to see it provided for by law. One does not want to depend on exemption. The trade union movement has on many occasions tried to get exemption from certain provisions. For instance, a mixed trade union wanted to hold a mixed executive meeting and made four applications for exemption without success. I must however, pay tribute to this hon. Minister because only two years ago we made an application to him in this regard and he granted it.</p>
<p>If the hon. the Minister has the right to grant exemption, if he deems it expedient to do so, I feel that there should not be other things to tie him down. Why must there be the provision of &#x201C;depending on the numbers&#x201D;? That should not be taken into consideration. If a trade union which previously consisted only of White workers is now prepared to allow Coloured and Indian workers as members, they should be allowed to take that step. If there is a mixed trade union that is prepared to take in Black workers as members and the Black workers are in favour of joining, they should be allowed to do so. I need not say anything more about the responsible attitude of Black trade unions where they have worked with responsible registered trade unions. I cannot over-emphasize this fact. But by trying to keep the workers apart we may just be causing trouble for ourselves. The close co-operation there is among workers of the various race groups the more benefit there will be for the whole country.</p>
<p>According to the figures quoted by the hon. the Minister this afternoon, it is evident that the Black workers in South Africa are vastly in the majority today and we certainly would rather have them as our friends than our enemies. We want them to feel that in the labour field they are not ostracized, that they can work side by side with the members of the other race groups. I know that in the past the Department of Labour tried to have separation among the race groups, and in some cases they succeeded for a while, but the employment of both White and Coloured workers in one industry caused problems because to provide all the separate facilities required became too costly for employers. In my opinion this is a matter that may often be taken to the Industrial Court if we are going to be so strict as to prevent workers working together. I have seen it in the engineering industry, the leather industry, the tobacco industry and the clothing industry; workers can work together. They have mutual respect for one another and they do not interfere in one another&#x2019;s affairs. I think the more we do away with laws which are aimed at separating people, and the more industrial relationships that are fostered, the better it will be for everybody concerned. People choose their friends, and so do the workers. Workers are no different to any of us here; they choose their friends in the same way we do. They invite whom they like to their homes, but when it comes to the workplace they are friendly and respect each other. None of us would invite a White hobo to our homes, and neither would a White worker invite a hobo or somebody he does not like to his home.</p>
<p>I believe there should be more freedom of choice in this regard. We must do away with bad race relations in this country for the benefit of all. If we wait too long, we shall find ourselves in the same position as poor Rhodesia. We do not want that situation to befall us. We must establish good relations among all race groups in this country. In this respect it is not only the Government which has a responsibility. The more we can establish contact with one another in the trade union movement, in employer organizations and among academics, the better it will be for everybody.</p>
<p>There is another matter to which I would like the hon. the Minister to give serious attention. I have talked about the Black trade union in the clothing industry. To a large extent this union followed the example of the established trade union in this industry. Sometimes the two unions acted jointly. Many members of that Black trade union may be commuters and may not fall under section 10 of the Act, but they have been members of that trade union for up to 20 years. They belong to a death benefit fund, which is in actual fact a type of insurance. This scheme is offered by the Homes Trust Company and a worker can cover his whole family in respect of death benefits for a premium of 28 cents per week. This benefit applies to trade union members only. It is a strong fund, with the result that premiums are only revised occasionally. The workers derive wonderfull benefits from this type of insurance. In the event of a still-born child or the death of a child up to six years old, workers receive R75. If both parents work in the industry they get double the amount In the event of the death of a child between the ages of six and fourteen years, a worker gets R150. A child of over 14 is regarded as an adult and in the case of the death of such a child a member receives R500. Where both parents are members, the payout will, of course, be R1 000. Workers have become used to these benefits which they would never have been able to obtain at that price if they had not been members of a group. They would have to pay ten times the amount as individuals for the same insurance cover. As I have said before, workers have paid into this scheme for years. There are also loan and welfare funds to which they have also contributed small amounts which they could afford. We must all realize that workers who earn R25 to R40 per week cannot afford to pay high premiums for anything. But as a group these workers have obtained very good benefits. They also have a medical benefit fund but in this respect they will not be excluded by the legislation as it is controlled by the industrial council. But as far as trade union benefits are concerned they will be the losers. I do not know how their officials will ever be able to explain to them that in terms of Government legislation they can no longer be members of a trade union or of these benefit funds. Mr. President, can you imagine the amount of frustration and despondency among these people when they hear about this? I would not like to be present. It may be that there will not only be frustration but also bitterness and hatred. I hope therefore even at this late stage, if we cannot have this clause amended, that the hon. the Minister, who has the right to grant exemptions, will immediately grant exemption to these people who have been members of these long-established trade unions, so that they can continue to remain members of these trade unions and of the benefit funds. If that is not done I am afraid that these otherwise very peaceful people may become very troublesome people.</p>
<p>I want to say that we are very pleased about those workers who are going to have trade union rights. For the first time the discrimination line has been broken and these people will be able to become members of trade unions. But when one considers the large number of workers who are not going to enjoy trade union rights, one begins to have doubts about this legislation. Is the effort worthwhile? The situation will also create administrative problems. For purposes of enrolment as members of trade unions, workers will have to be asked for identification so that the race group to which they belong can be established, and also the country they come from. No one can be a member unless he is registered in terms of section 10. This will cause embarrassment and from an administrative point of view it will be almost impossible to carry out. Added to this is the fact that elsewhere in the Bill provision is made that a person who is guilty of an offence in this respect will be fined R500. In my opinion this fine is out of all proportion.</p>
<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will allow the citizens of the Black States to enjoy the same rights as South Africans. Many of these States are not independent, and many of them may perhaps never ask for independence. There is something else which I believe the Manpower Commission can give further consideration to, viz. the question of migrant workers from neighbouring states. But as far as the self-governing territories are concerned which have not yet received their independence, I do not think we have a leg to stand on if we try to exclude their citizens from obtaining trade union membership. When the provisions of this measure become known overseas in the wake of the Wiehahn and other reports we should not be surprised if people over there say that we in South Africa are crooks. They will say that we mislead people with a good report but that when it comes to the crunch we back-pedal. This in itself will be very bad for South Africa&#x2019;s image overseas.</p>
<p>As far as commuters are concerned, I believe that only a very small percentage of Black workers who commute to places such as Durban, Rustenburg, Pretoria and Brits will qualify for membership of Black trade unions. We need these Black workers. How can we exclude such vast numbers of these people from becoming trade union members only because they live in Black States that are not independent but are situated almost on the outskirts of these cities and towns? I cannot see how this can be done and how it will work. Furthermore, I feel that it is far better to have control over everybody, rather than to let one section go one way and another section take a different direction. In the first place there will be clashes between these sections. That is definite. Whatever one does, those people are going to be dissatisfied and they are going to organize against the employers, and this may lead to strikes.</p>
<p>As far as the finances are concerned, I believe that not only should people have privileges but they should also have responsibilities. I am pleased that provision is made for inspectors to inspect the books. We have always had to submit balance sheets and audited accounts to the industrial registrar whereas the Black unions were not compelled to do so. I can tell you that quite possibly millions of rands disappeared and the workers were left in the lurch because nobody saw to it that the finances were properly administered. Any opportunist could come along and persuade the worker to pay as much as possible and then disappear with the money. That is one of my fears as far as this provisional registration is concerned. There will be plenty of racketeers who will try to take advantage of a situation. We know that people have sold shares, they have sold land, in some cases for millions of rands, and then they have suddenly disappeared. How easy it is for somebody to say: I have been registered; join my union. Then they carry on for a while and then suddenly disappear. We must look after these people because the culprits may never be brought to book. Therefore I feel we must have the closest co-operation possible. The larger the number of responsible people who are represented in trade unions the better it will be for our country.</p>
<p>As I have said, I hope the hon. the Minister will use his discretionary powers to grant the present trade union members immediate exemption so they do not lose those benefits they have helped to build up over very many years and which they cannot do without.</p>
<p>I repeat that we welcome the Manpower Commission and the directives issued to them. We have no objection to the Minister having the right to terminate the period of office of any person. He may appoint additional members and with that too we are in agreement, as also with the provision enabling the hon. the Minister to fill casual vacancies for any unexpired period and so forth I am particularly in favour of the provision for investigation and research to be done by these people, because I do not think we have had sufficient research, particularly as far as labour requirements are concerned, in this country. We must see where industrial relations can be improved because better industrial relations mean better productivity on the part of the workers. The commission will survey the manpower position from time to time, keep abreast of developments and ensure the effectiveness of labour legislation. For that reason we are not going to oppose this Bill as a whole, but at the Committee Stage we shall vote against certain clauses. However, we shall not oppose the Bill as a whole because there are many advantages contained in this Bill for the workers and the Manpower Commission is definitely one of them. I hope the Manpower Commission will be composed of impartial people and I sincerely hope that there will be no political appointments.</p>

<p>I hope that we will have people who will work impartially, as all Government servants should, in accordance with the laws and not in accordance with ideologies. I hope that this commission will work very closely with the industrial councils which represent both employers and employees. If the commission really wants to know what is going on it will find the co-operation of the industrial councils invaluable.</p>
<p>When we come to the question of mixed trade unions, I must say that I thought that we had seen the last of separate trade unions, but here in this Bill the Government is still holding on to that idea, should there be insufficient numbers to warrant a separate union. That does not help. One must at least have confidence in the workers to decide for themselves on this issue as to whether they want to be a mixed union or a separate trade union. Under this provision they are again being deprived of their rights; there is no freedom of association whatsoever. The hon. the Minister has quite rightly said that the implementation of this legislation will be studied internationally. This provision will be regarded as continued discrimination, and that is what it is. Give the workers freedom once and for all to decide for themselves. If they have any regrets, they can always decide to break away from one union and establish another for themselves. But give them a chance to see what they want to do and what they consider is in their best interests.</p>

<p>I shall not speak about provisional registration as I have already dealt with it. I was very relieved when I saw the amendments submitted in the Other Place regarding the relationship clause. This appears under the proposed new section 4B. However, I am afraid that these amendments do not go far enough and therefore I am completely opposed to clause 4 but I shall deal with this during the Committee Stage.</p>
<p>As far as the political prohibition is concerned, I have no objection in this regard. I think we need this clause. Nobody can say this is discriminatory and that it is only now that Blacks are being permitted that we are inserting it. We have had this clause since 1956 and I do not think we have any complaints in regard to it. This applies to everybody equally and we have no objection to it.</p>
<p>As far as the Industrial Court is concerned, there is a very healthy development in the draft legislation in connection with this court but I do want to ask the hon. the Minister one question. I agree wholeheartedly with all the matters they are going to handle, but there is one thing which is not completely clear to me in the event of an industrial dispute.</p>
<p>We have found on many occasions in the trade union movement that sometimes the workers do not want to take strike action. When one is negotiating regarding a new agreement or in regard to amendments to an existing agreement, a deadlock may be reached and one can go no further. The workers prefer to resort to arbitration to decide their fate instead of resorting to strike action. I had the experience this year where the employers refused to go to arbitration. That leaves the trade union no other alternative but to notify the Minister that when the agreement expires in 30 days&#x2019; time there will be a legal strike. Why should strike action be forced on workers when they are quite prepared to accept the decision of an arbitrator? I cannot find any provision that states clearly what the position is in respect of this question of arbitration. If the workers who are the ones who can cause the greatest disruption decide that they want to go to arbitration it should not be possible for the employers to veto that decision.</p>
<p>I welcome the provision which provides for an appeal from the Industrial Court to the Appellate Division. I think that is a sound principle in our industrial legislation.</p>
<p>I think I have said enough about the two-thirds majority on the industrial council, except to add that I think a two-thirds majority is a very large majority. I do not think we should give the Industrial Court extra work if industrial councils can settle their disputes by a two-thirds majority.</p>
<p>I am pleased about the provision that when a trade union has been refused admission to an industrial council it can now appeal to the Industrial Court within 30 days. I think that is some relief as far as that provision is concerned.</p>
<p>I am very pleased that section 77 is being repealed. The hon. the Minister has appealed to the employers and the employers will know in future that the workers will have recourse to the Industrial Court. In this way a cancer has been removed from our legislation and from South Africa, a cancer that has done us great harm.</p>

<p>Sir, I was just assimilating the remark made by the hon. Senator Henderson. I was in a mood to make a very conciliatory speech but if he starts me off on that track, I may change my mind!</p>
<p>*Mr. President, I think the era has arrived in which the lamb and the lion lie down together and I want to thank the hon. Senator Scheepers for the conciliatory and moderate manner in which she stated her point of view. I think it is generally known that she and I have often quarrelled in the past. I do think, however, that because of the few years she has spent in the arms of the UP and now in those of the NRP in this House she has mellowed with age. She did not come here with a prepared lecture on trade unionism and how it should be applied. We know she is an authority on trade unionism&#x2014;a much greater authority than I am.</p>
<p>I do not want to go into the details of this legislation; I just want to say a few words about its underlying principles. I do not think there is a great difference at the moment between ourselves and that party.</p>

<p>As far as the NP is concerned, our whole development is based on the Hegelian philosophy of thesis, antithesis and synthesis. That side of the House says we are not going far enough and there may be some hon. Senators on this side who say we are going too far. I think the boa the Minister is travelling along the golden middle path and going as far as he possibly can under present circumstances in applying the Wiehahn report. [Interjections.] Yes, as I said yesterday, Sir, I am the hard core of the NP.</p>

<p>Yes. In the first place, I wish to congratulate the hon. the</p>
<p>Minister most heartily on the elevated status he has acquired since he was here last. He has been appointed Leader of the House in the Other Place. The Cabinet is the most closed trade union in the country, Sir. I wish also to congratulate the hon. the Prime Minister <i>in absentia</i> on the appointment of a new Cabinet Fortunately, it is his prerogative to decide who should serve where. In passing, Sir, I was a member of a deputation that approached Dr. Malan to include Dr. Verwoerd in the Cabinet. The old doctor just looked at us and said: &#x201C;Oh! I thought it was my prerogative to decide whom I want in my Cabinet&#x201D; I do think, however, that we can congratulate the present Prime Minister on the appointment of the new Cabinet and we wish him everything of the best during his régime.</p>
<p>The NP has a long record, of course, in connection with labour legislation and the handling of labour matters in this country. Neither do I think we need be ashamed of that record. As a matter of fact, the first NP Government came into power with the assistance of the Labour Party. We had three unilingual English-speaking Labourites in our Cabinet&#x2014;Samson, Boydell and Creswell. Mr. Creswell and I addressed meetings together and Mr. Boydell and I attended physical culture classes together. I found them good teachers, Sir. As a Nationalist I felt very much at home with them and during the war years I as a UP supporter also felt at home with them. Gen. Smuts used to say that he could not win an election unless he had the support of the workers. I am simply sketching the background, Sir. The simple fact of the matter is that the co-operation of the working community of South Africa is essential for the welfare of South Africa, for the prosperity of South Africa and for peace in South Africa.</p>

<p>You are right.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#loock">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. J. H. LOOCK</person>:</from>
<p>The Government that neglects the working community in South Africa is neglecting itself&#x2014;it is digging its own grave. The record of the NP shows that throughout the years it has satisfied the working community; so much so that today there is no longer any room for a Labour Party in this country. The Labour Party disappeared under the NP Government because the workers were so satisfied.</p>
<p>Just look at the position in Vereeniging and its environs, Sir. The member of Parliament for Vanderbijlpark addressed a meeting of the Steel Workers&#x2019; Union as recently as Friday evening at which 14 of their committee members were present. He and Mr. Ballot addressed them and they expressed their unanimous approval of this Bill. That area is the very centre of the workers community in South Africa. During elections we have no trouble at all in the entire Vaal Triangle. The workers vote for us. They vote for us because they have confidence in us. But our policy in respect of the workers of South Africa, just like our policy in respect of all the other problems, is a dynamic and organic policy; it is not a static policy. We are not so stupid as to remain stationary and stagnate. However, if one develops so fast that one outstrips time, one gets unseated as hon. Senators of the Opposition were. They wanted to move faster than time and the electorate were prepared to allow with the result that they are sitting where they are sitting today. One has to keep pace with development Sir; we do not close our eyes to new developments. Under present-day circumstances it is essential that certain changes be effected to our labour structure. This is as a result of developments in the past few years in the international sphere. We cannot live in isolation and the Government and the Minister have realized that. They realized that we would be heading for a dead-end if we did not effect certain adjustments.</p>

<p>We saw that years ago.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#loock">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. J. H. LOOCK</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, but you acted too soon and you were too clumsy in your handling of the situation. The hon. the Minister has not handled the situation in a clumsy way. He appointed the Wiehahn Commission and the Riekert Commission and he had the matter investigated scientifically. Those reports have not yet been completed. These are only the first of the reports. This is the first legislation that is based on those reports. We are not suggesting that this is perfect legislation but at this stage it is necessary legislation. It can be amended and further legislation can be introduced in future.</p>
<p>The fact remains, however, that the hon. the Minister and the Government are not blind to the demands of the times. And the first demand of the times is that we take note of the international labour set-up. Have hon. Senators ever thought what would happen to us if the international labour community were to boycott us? They can paralyse us in one afternoon. They can refuse to allow aeroplanes to land and refuse to off-load our ships. They have the power to do that and we have to co-operate with them. It is no use saying that they are outsiders and that they are inclined towards communism. The practical reality of the situation is that we cannot ignore those people; they are linked with the labour organizations in this country.</p>
<p>What has been missing from our labour legislation in the past has been of a twofold nature. There were two major aspects that they used against us. The first was the position of the Black worker and the second was job reservation, that is, the protection the White worker enjoyed and the position of the Black worker. As far as the position of the Black man is concerned he has at no time been prevented from forming a trade union in this country. The hon. Senator Scheepers will remember how Clemens Kandali tried to form a Black trade union. He was reasonably successful but they were never registered. Today there are still 40 unregistered Black trade unions in the country with 80 000 members. The question facing the Government is whether it should allow those trade unions to carry on with their activities in an uncontrolled fashion and to be used as springboards for foreign communist and Marxist propaganda. After all, we know what is happening in England. We know too that one of the basic principles of the communists is to infiltrate trade unions and topple governments in that way. We are not blind to such a situation. Would it not be better for us to have these trade unions registered so that we would know what funds they had, who financed them, who their leaders were and what their aims were, so that we would have them with us and be able to keep an eye on them, and not only keep an eye on them but give them the right which is every ordinary worker&#x2019;s due? That is precisely what the Government is doing now.</p>
<p>There may be a difference as to the detailed reason why the Government is doing it but as regards the basic principle of registering Black trade unions, acknowledging them officially and involving them in industrial council decisions, there cannot be any difference of opinion between this side of the House and that side of the House. There may be a difference of opinion as far as the application of the principle is concerned but as far as the principle which the hon. the Minister has now accepted, is concerned, there cannot be any difference of opinion. And that is what we are doing. We must remember that it is absolutely essential for the safety of this country and the prosperity of this country that we satisfy the Black worker as much as possible. I have always thought that in spite of all the moaning, the Republic of South Africa has remained a happy hunting ground for Black workers. The fact that there are nearly one million foreign Black workers in our country, the fact that we still have nearly 100 000 Black workers from Mozambique, which is a Marxist state, working in our mines, &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; the fact that in the days of Paul Kruger there were 4 000 Chinese working on the Simmer and Jack mines alone and the fact that the members from Natal had to import Indians to come to work here, Indians who did not want to return but who wanted to stay here, proves that this is the one country on the continent of Africa which offers the best conditions to the Black worker. In no other state in Africa is the Black worker treated better than he is treated here. However, we want to treat him well in a controlled manner; we want to treat him well in any organized manner and grant him his trade union rights. What is wrong with that, Sir? They already have that. That is why we and the Opposition agree&#x2014;unless, of course, they want to go much further than we are prepared to go at this stage.</p>

<p>We subscribe to the capitalist system. The only guarantee of survival the capitalist system has is that the worker must not be exploited. If we were to exploit the worker in the way he has been exploited in some countries it would mean the end of the capitalist system. That will happen by way of a Marxist revolution. Our strongest weapon against a Marxist revolution in this country is to satisfy the worker.</p>

<p>And that is what we are doing. Today the employer&#x2019;s attitude towards the employee is totally different from what it was in the days of the British industrial revolution. In those days the worker was a slave and the employer was his capitalist master. The relationship was that of master towards servant. The days of such a relationship are past, Sir. Today it is a question of partnership &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; between the entrepreneur and the employee. That is the tendency throughout the world. That tendency is also developing here. We cannot get away from it We cannot rid ourselves of the Black man. We need him and he needs us. Our State machinery must be geared in such a way that all points of friction are eliminated. The National Party is known for having eliminated points of friction over the years. This legislation paves the way for another adjustment, and not only to satisfy the Black worker and the foreign labour people. It is also essential for the economy and for the peace and security of our country and of the White man himself in this country.</p>
<p>The second principle I wish to touch upon is that of protection. All kinds of wild and irresponsible stories are, of course, being spread throughout the country as a result of the Wiehahn Commission; for example, that the White worker will now be oppressed and destroyed because the Black worker will oust him, and that there will be a repetition of the 1922 revolution. But that time is past, Sir. This is not an analogous case. There are other factors which protect the White worker today.</p>

<p>Job reservation has been applied in five spheres of employment at most in this country. What is the position in respect of two essential fields, those of the mining and building industries? There is a shortage of skilled labour in the mining industry today not only in South Africa but throughout the continent of Africa&#x2014;as a matter of fact, over the entire world. To be a White mine worker today is the surest guarantee one can have that one will not lose one&#x2019;s job because the whole world needs that White miner. It does not matter which country it is, they are all after our technological knowledge, and our mining technology was developed by the White man. That is his greatest protection.</p>
<p>As far as the building industry is concerned, the White man is no longer interested in learning how to make bricks. He no longer wants to do that work. Because of future development and the new cities that will have to be built, we will not have a sufficient number of White technicians and artisans to cope with all the work. Therefore the White man need not be afraid of anything because the Black workers need his expertise and experience.</p>
<p>Mr. President, on behalf of this side of the House I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the scientific way in which this legislation has been drafted and introduced. I wish him everything of the best and I trust that this legislation will usher in a new era not only for this country but internationally as well.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I wish to start off by congratulating the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers on a most outstanding speech. The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers is known in the labour world in South Africa as being in the forefront of trade union workers and leaders. I would say that there is nobody in this country who has greater knowledge of Black and mixed trade unions than does the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. For that reason she must be a world authority in this particular sphere, because nowhere else in the world do we have this particular situation in existence. The hon. the Minister, I am glad to say, listened most attentively to the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers, and I am sure he has gained very considerable information and assistance from the ideas and the advice she put forward.</p>
<p>I agree entirely with the hon. Senator Dr. Loock that the speech of the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers was that of a moderate. She is known as a moderate and I think the speech that she delivered this afternoon can only be described as a moderate speech.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the hon. the Minister is not here now and I would like him to be present when I address him.</p>

<p>No, I am not picking him out I want actually to congratulate him and that is why I would like him to be in his seat when I do so. I assured the hon. the Minister on a previous occasion that we on this side of the House would give him all the support possible where he carried out the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission as accepted in the White Paper. Thus I do not mean to make politics at all at the expense of what has been done in this particular Bill. The hon. the Minister of Finance will probably pass that information on to him.</p>
<p>Let me say straightaway, Sir, that we on this side of the House are very disappointed because this Bill has not gone far enough in respect of aspects referred to by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. We know the reason why this is the case. The hon. Senator Dr. Loock gave us the reason. I would like the hon. Senator Dr. Loock to be in his seat when I direct a few observations to him.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the hon. Senator Dr. Loock, I was saying that we on these benches were extremely disappointed that the Bill before the House has not gone as far as we would like it to have gone. But the hon. Senator Dr. Loock gave us the reason for this and we accepted it. You see, Sir, the NP has in the past looked over its right shoulder, and the hon. Senator Dr. Loock is quite correct when he says that the NP got into power and retained power by looking after the interests of the White worker.</p>

<p>That is the answer&#x2014;the Black workers did not have the vote, and that is why the NP held the attitude on trade union matters and towards the worker of this country that they did. But the hon. Senator Dr. Loock has perceived that the situation has changed dramatically in this country. One admission that he made this afternoon has not, to my knowledge, been made before by an hon. gentleman sitting on those benches. He admitted that we have to take into consideration the international pressures that are upon this country. We have to take the requirements of the international community into consideration. That is common sense, Sir. We have said this over the years, and I am not criticizing the hon. Senator for saying it. I think it takes courage to say it, and I think it will do a lot of good that he has said it But Sir, at the same time I must say that this is a complete departure from what we heard from those benches in the past. What words did they use in the past? &#x201C;Ons sal nie buig nie!&#x201D; On every occasion when the request was made from this side that we should consider international pressures, that we should consider what overseas opinion could say and do to us if we carried on in this stupid way, we were told: &#x201C;Ons sal nie buig nie!&#x201D; Now there is this great change and, Sir, we welcome this change; we welcome even the crumbs that we are receiving. But we would suggest to the hon. the Minister that he continue on the path that he has embarked on at an accelerated pace because it will be to the benefit of South Africa, not only of the Blacks. It will also be to the benefit of our economy and to the benefit of the Whites. Again I give him this undertaking that whenever he introduces legislation in this House that is in line with the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission, in line with the intentions of the NP as expressed in the White Paper, he will receive the full support of this side of the House. Only when he drags his feet, as he unfortunately has done on this occasion in introducing this Bill with the parsimonious concessions that we find in it, will he get criticism from us. As an Opposition it is our duty to criticize and we will continue to do so. But we have criticized in a moderate way, Mr. President, so that under no circumstances will we give comfort to the HNP in the attacks that they are making upon the NP. I feel that the hon. the Minister must realize that he must not continue to look over his right shoulder because we do not have unlimited time in which to bring about the situation that the Wiehahn Commission considers it is necessary for us to bring about in order for us to survive as Whites in the country as it is today and to go forward.</p>
<p>There is one further point that was raised by the hon. Senator Dr. Loock that I do think requires an answer. He said that the NP was not prepared to liberalize the trade unions to the extent that the Wiehahn Commission would like to see them liberalized because of the danger of communist infiltration, and he gave the unhappy example of Great Britain. Sir, all of us in this hon. House are fully cognizant of the situation in Britain to which he referred, where the communists have gained a hold on the unions and have the country by the throat by virtue of the fact that they have gained such a hold. That could never happen in this country, because of the Industrial Conciliation Act, the product of the brains of the late Gen. Smuts, which is probably the greatest piece of industrial legislation in the world today. With its checks and balances, as the hon. the Minister knows, it is almost impossible for an industrial situation to arise such as the one which has developed in Britain. It is almost impossible for a legal strike to take place in this country with the machinery which is provided in the Act. That is why we are free of strikes to the extent we are. It is wonderful legislation and I think the hon. the Minister realizes that this is so.</p>
<p>On one occasion I heard Minister Marais Steyn say that he had been on a visit to Britain and that he had spoken to some parliamentarians there. I cannot remember whether these parliamentarians were Labour or Conservative party members, or who they were, but I remember clearly that he used words to the effect that they wished they could have this legislation on their Statute Book. I think the actual words of parliamentarian to whom he spoke that he would give his back teeth for this legislation. But the situation in Britain cannot be compared to that in South Africa because the trade unions there have the country by the throat. I am very sorry about that and wish it were not so.</p>
<p>Having said what I have, I should like to make a plea to the hon. the Minister. I am not going to cover any of the ground that was covered so adequately and so comprehensively by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers, but there are one or two points I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister for his consideration.</p>
<p>The first matter relates to the definition of an employee. This has been discussed by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers, but I want to discuss only one aspect of it which relates to frontier commuters. My plea to the hon. the Minister is to give blanket exemption to frontier commuters of the type to which I want now to refer. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister saw in the Press quite recently that not more than 3% of the Blacks in the greater Durban area will in fact be entitled to join registered trade unions.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Senator is aware of my statement in regard to the position in Durban?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>No, I am sorry. I have not seen the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement, but he can advise us in his reply what the actual position is. My point is that a basic reason why the situation has developed in the greater Durban area is because a large number of workers live in KwaMashu. Until comparatively recently KwaMashu was part of the White area or the so-called common area of South Africa. During the time Minister Koornhof was the competent Minister in the then Department of Bantu Administration and Development, the boundaries of kwaZulu were changed so that KwaMashu fell within kwaZulu. The moment that happened all the people who had previously been residents of so-called White South Africa, overnight became residents of kwaZulu. It was said by cynics that the reason why this was done was to indicate to South Africa and to the world that the homelands policy of the NP was succeeding, because overnight some hundreds of thousands of Blacks fell into kwaZulu and figures could be produced to show that the number of Blacks returning to the homeland had risen dramatically during the period this was done. It is said unkindly&#x2014;by myself among others&#x2014;that this was a sleight of hand, but be that as it may, it resulted in this anomalous situation developing. People who had been resident in White South Africa and were workers of White South Africa would, if this legislation had been introduced before that time, have enjoyed the privileges that are now being granted to Black workers in terms of the Bill, but they are now being deprived of it. This is one of the unsatisfactory aspects of this Bill, viz. that people who historically should enjoy these benefits are now to be denied them because a line was drawn on a map and KwaMashu fell outside the so-called White or common area of South Africa and inside kwaZulu. I therefore plead with the hon. the Minister that a blanket exemption should be given in respect of these people. I think it would be a matter of grave injustice to them if as a result of an administrative action taken just a few years ago they were to lose the rights which they would otherwise have enjoyed. I think an extremely strong case can be made out to the hon. the Minister for him to grant all such workers in kwaZulu a blanket exemption which he can do in terms of the Bill. If the hon. the Minister does not do so, I am afraid that the Government &#x2026;</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>That puts a different complexion on it. I shall deal with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply during the Third Reading debate.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers also referred to several other areas in South Africa, e.g. the Rustenburg area, where there were similar difficulties. But the other significant area in Natal is the Newcastle area. Some 15 years ago it was decided to make Newcastle a growth point. Various reasons were advanced for this decision. Newcastle has the water, it has the land, it is equidistant from two large markets, viz. Durban and Johannesburg, the railway runs through it, it is in the centre of a coal-bearing area, and there are various other reasons. The policy of the Nationalist Government at that time was to establish industries on the border of the so-called Native areas, the homelands, or whatever one might like to call them. The nearest homeland was some 40 miles from Newcastle, viz. Nqutu. If Mohamed cannot go to the mountain, the mountain must come to Mohamed, and this is what happened in this particular case.</p>
<p>The Government purchased a large number of farms and created a Bantustan and in doing so it exacerbated the consolidation situation in Natal, but it could nonetheless be said that Newcastle was a border area. This fact has a bearing on this particular Bill because the Blacks that were in that area were in the same position as the KwaMashu Blacks. They had rights, but as soon as this transformation took place, all those Blacks fell within the boundaries of kwaZulu, the same as KwaMashu did, and they have been deprived of their rights.</p>
<p>It is not as if there are only a few Blacks who have been affected. I understand that the number of Blacks in Madadene and Mountainview&#x2014;I am informed by my colleague&#x2014;is 230 000. I understand from the police that that is a conservative figure and that in fact it is in excess of that number. The majority of those Blacks as far as I am aware came from Black spots in the north of Natal, from the Charlestown area where there were a tremendous number of Blacks. This area was cleaned out and they were settled there. The Blacks in Newcastle who lived in a so-called location were also forcibly ejected and were settled in Madadene. No doubt the population grew from other sources as well, from Black spots which were in the so-called White areas of South Africa. But the majority of people who came there were&#x2014;there is no doubt about this at all&#x2014;from the White areas of South Africa. So in principle, therefore, they are no different from the people in kwaZulu. They have been deprived of a right which they would have enjoyed under this Bill if this Bill had been introduced 15 years ago. I think the hon. the Minister follows my logic and I think that the hon. the Minister must think of treating them as a special case as well and of granting exemption to them.</p>
<p>I have obtained certain figures from the report as to what the position was regarding these Black frontier commuters from kwaZulu, and these refer to the commuters and not just the population. I have figures here of frontier commuters from kwaZulu in 1970 and in 1976. In 1970 the commuters numbered 127 000 and in 1976, after kwaZulu took over KwaMashu and Madadene, the figure rose to 326 000. 326 000 commuters! I should imagine there are 1&#x00BD; million to 1¾ million Blacks who are affected by these changes of boundaries, and I do think that a very strong and fair case can be made out for the hon. the Minister to grant these people blanket exemption. I trust that the hon. the Minister will view this request in the spirit in which it is made. I am thinking, I can assure him, as is the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers, of the good of South Africa, and I am thinking in terms of the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission.</p>
<p>Merely to refresh our minds on the attitude adopted by the Wiehahn Commission, I would like to read again a couple of passages from that commission&#x2019;s report which indicate that this matter is a matter of great urgency and not one that can be left over until some time in the future. I implore the hon. the Minister to grasp this nettle and grasp it firmly, and to get a move on with legislation which will put into operation in the shortest possible time all the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission. I repeat that everything he does in that direction will receive the fullest support of members of this side of the House.</p>
<p>I refer to page 20 of the report, paragraph 3.36.1. I am reading this out because I think we should once again remember how strong were the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission, a commission which, as the hon. the Minister himself has said, was made up not of politicians but of experts, scientists, including someone I consider one of the best brains in the country on the question of labour legislation, i.e. Prof. Wiehahn himself. That is my view and I think it is the view of the hon. the Minister. What he has said and what he has put into his report is a matter of the greatest importance to us in South Africa. The report states&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">A statutory prohibition forbidding Black workers to form or to join a trade union or to register officially a trade union of their own would not only be contrary to the official policy of moving away from discrimination on racial or colour lines but would also amount to an absolute enforcement of the present discriminatory dualistic system of industrial relations.</block>
<p>Those are strong words, Sir, but that is in fact the position we have got to face and I commend these words to the hon. the Minister anew. He should read them again. I may be repeating myself but it is worth repeating. We must proceed with the utmost haste in putting the recommendations into operation. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Such a prohibition would constitute a serious infringement of a worker&#x2019;s freedom of association and thus be in direct conflict with one of the fundamental principles underlying self-governance in a free-enterprise economic system.</block>
<p>We have heard about communism. The way to outbid communism is for these people to be brought into these unions, as so ably set out and so ably discussed by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. I want now to read paragraph 3.36.6&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">A prohibition would undoubtedly have the effect of driving Black trade unionism underground and uniting Black workers not only against the authorities but, more important, also against the system of free enterprise in South Africa. It would certainly add fuel to the flames of radicalism on the part of those who wish to overthrow the system.</block>
<p>I want to conclude with those words, Sir. I should like at least to thank the hon. the Minister for the crumbs we have received, but once again I ask him to give us more.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is my privilege to participate in this special debate today, particularly&#x2014;if I may put it this way&#x2014;in view of the responsible way in which hon. Senators have spoken up to now and put their case. But I want to say this to our hon. friends. The most important point they make is that this Bill does not go far enough but our reply to that is that this party goes as far as it thinks desirable in the interests of the country and in the interests of the workers. That applies now and it will also apply in future. There is a secret for success, and I want to repeat it now for the umpteenth time, viz. that one must not do the wrong thing at the wrong time. That is a lesson those friends might well keep in mind.</p>

<p>You have been saying that for years.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#visser">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>
<p>And you have still not learned the lesson! You simply do not learn it. Perhaps sometimes we move slowly, Sir&#x2014;and who will not say that sometimes it is too slowly; that may happen&#x2014;but years ago the head of state in Russia said that it was better to move one step forward at a time and rest on that step than to take two steps forward and fall back three, because then you were further behind than would have been the case if you had gone about things differently. It is the aim of this Government and this Minister to ensure that having taken the steps they do, they can halt and then move forward from there as and when time shows it to be necessary.</p>
<p>I should like to commence by expressing my appreciation for something. I know of few Acts, I know of few reports, where the Ministers concerned have gone as far out of their way before taking up a standpoint, introducing legislation and consulting the relevant organizations involved throughout South Africa as was the case with this legislation. I should like to express my appreciation for what the hon. the Minister has done in this connection. He has possibly even been insulted at certain places by people who differ with him, but I have never heard or read that he did not keep cool or that he lost his temper. He is always calm and that is one of the reasons why he is so successful.</p>
<p>This hon. the Minister has travelled virtually throughout the country in order to convince employers and employees. In the first place he wanted to get their opinions and in the second place he wanted to tell them what he thought was in the interests of the country. Let me say at once that I know of no Minister who has had a more difficult task in recent years than this Minister, who has had to take such a forward step in regard to something which in the nature of things gives rise to such a difference of opinion among ourselves and among foreigners. I do not take it amiss of people if they differ with us, Sir. Some of the supporters of the NP today differ with the Government&#x2014;in and outside Parliament&#x2014;about certain matters. But a matter like this is like a minefield. Labour relations is one of the most sensitive matters that one has to deal with, particularly in a country like South Africa with its mixed population and with its different standards of development. I say with the greatest sense of responsibility that the hon. Minister finds himself in the position that on the left hand there are people saying: Move quickly; you are going too slowly; you must go further, while on the other side there are people who say: You are going too quickly; you are going too far, we do not agree with you. Can you appreciate the position of the hon. the Minister, Sir? What Government in a matter like this, labour relations, would tackle them holus-bolus? In the interests of his own people, in the interests of South Africa, he dare not do it. He dare not do it, and if he does do it then he is being irresponsible and he must take the consequences.</p>
<p>I should like to express my appreciation for the actions of the hon. the Minister. But I should also like to tell him that I do have some sympathy and appreciation for those on our right who do not want to come the whole way with us, those who have reservations about certain matters, those who are concerned about their lot in the future, those who are afraid that their future may be threatened. I appreciate this only too well, Sir, because I know about labour matters, perhaps more about the employers&#x2019; side than the employees&#x2019; side. Perhaps at this stage I should ask the hon. the Minister to continue to have that compassion, that appreciation and that tolerance on the road ahead that he has shown up to now. We must not go too far ahead. I hope the hon. the Minister will always bear this in mind: We must not go too far because then we will be in difficulties. It is in the interests of South Africa that we should take the workers with us. We can never take everybody with us&#x2014;that is impossible. Who would maintain today that we have to take everybody with us? That is impossible. No person can do that; nobody can do it, but we must take the majority of our people with us. If it is necessary to take one step instead of two so that we can take the people along with us, then that is what we must do. We must not be too hasty. We see what is written in the newspapers, Sir, and what is said by trade union leaders in public. With this in mind, I want to say to the hon. the Minister: Make haste slowly, but not so slowly that we are harmed unnecessarily in the process. That is not necessary. The secret lies in taking those steps that are in the interests of South Africa under present circumstances.</p>
<p>I want to come back to the question of completely free association. We know that that is the policy of our friends opposite but they know that it is not our policy. They know that mixed trade unions are not our policy.</p>

<p>It is not our policy to encourage mixed trade unions. I have always said so. If I am wrong, the hon. the Minister can put me right. I stand by that: This Government is not in favour of integration in the trade union movement. We are, of course, in favour of the abolition of discrimination, but the removal of discrimination does not mean integration. That is how I see it. That is why I can support this legislation, because if it were otherwise I would probably have taken up a different viewpoint.</p>

<p>There are restrictions on mixed trade unions. Our policy has always been separate trade unions. Hon. Senators complain about free association; they say that there is no free association. I admit that. But now they say there is free association? Why is the hon. Senator so confused? I do not understand the hon. Senator.</p>
<p>The other point made by hon. Senators opposite is the position of workers from non-self-governing Black States who cannot become members of trade unions. What is our policy in that connection? I say again that the hon. Minister deals with the situation as it is. At the moment that is the policy. As we go forward, as we learn and as the hon. the Minister sees the situation, changes may occur. I do not say today that there will be no changes. We know that this is an evolutionary measure, and I emphasize the words &#x201C;evolutionary measure&#x201D;, with even greater emphasis on the word &#x201C;evolutionary&#x201D;. We grow as circumstances dictate, as our people can accept it and when it is in the interests of South Africa. But I am opposed, and I take it the party and the Government and the Minister are opposed, to our policy resulting in integration. We are opposed to total mixing; I am totally opposed to it. The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers said: &#x201C;We want to make friends of these people rather than enemies.&#x201D; I agree with her. But that is precisely what this legislation is about, namely to make friends in a responsible way. It does not help to make friends and at the same time to lose them. What would one then achieve? That is what those hon. Senators want. They want us to make friends on the left and lose them on the right. That is not our aim and that we shall not do. We are concerned about those who do not side with us, those who have sided with us up to now. We are going to canvas them; We shall continue to tell them how we see the position for the future. The avenues of communication between us must always be open. We must not mistrust one another; we must trust one another because if we do not trust one another we shall never find one another. If we trust one another, then there is a chance that if we do not agree now eventually we shall agree. I want to ask the trade unions tonight to trust the Minister. This is not a blank cheque.</p>
<p>There are certain things one can argue which are far-reaching. There are certain amendments on which I could argue and on which I should also like clarity in certain respects. But there must be a basis of trust because, if one does not have that, where does one find oneself in a case like this? I am acting on the assumption&#x2014;the hon. the Minister can tell me if I am wrong&#x2014;that the object of this legislation is not to throw the White worker to the wolves. That is by no means the intention. And if it is so, then I am opposed to it I am not ashamed to say that I am opposed to it But I do not see it that way, and the hon. the Minister has also said in a public statement that he does not see it that way. That is not the intention and I accept his word. In terms of this legislation the Minister is given a tremendous amount of power. I concede that One could argue in relation to certain clauses that perhaps too much power is being given to the Minister and that perhaps the pressure on him will be so great that he may at times find himself in difficulty. That is the danger there. The success of this legislation will also depend largely on its implementation, as is the case with any legislation. That is also the case with this legislation where the Minister is being given so much power and discretion. He is being given a great deal of power, but we know too that this brings great responsibility with it. A government expects a great sense of responsibility from its Ministers. Should there be a Minister without that great sense of responsibility, we know what will happen. After all, we have experienced this.</p>
<p>The legislation does not only protect the White worker, and this I want to stress. I see this as a protection for the non-White as well. In our country we cannot protect one and leave the other unprotected. In the nature of things this is White South Africa but we do have non-Whites among us. We are interdependent in many spheres. We are most closely interdependent in the sphere of economic life. I accept that. We protect the non-Whites and we protect the Whites against the dangers from outside and from inside. I need not mention this to hon. Senators. We know the dangers of the communist world and how they increasingly try to undermine our trade unions to the detriment of the Whites and the Government in South Africa, and not only the Whites but also the responsible non-Whites. A responsible non-White is as little acceptable to communism as a responsible White. We cannot keep them in separate compartments. Certain things we do together on the basis of the NP policy of segregation as far as it is practicable and desirable in the interests of South Africa, and also in the interests of our society as a whole. I stress the words &#x201C;in the interests of our society as a whole.&#x201D; That is an extremely important yardstick. But we do have one proviso, one condition; that is, that it should not affect the future of the White and his survival and not prejudice or destroy it. Is that an unreasonable condition? As I understand the legislation&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister can tell me if I am right&#x2014;there are numerous built-in protective measures, and the White will be no less protected against dangerous exploitation from dangerous employers, if there are such people.</p>

<p>That is the basis of this legislation. We are trying to establish a structure so that there can be orderliness in the labour field in South Africa, now and in the future. I do not see this legislation as legislation to disrupt labour peace. Of course, we shall have to be very careful. We shall have to be very careful from what I can deduce from what certain leaders have said in the newspapers and from statements they have made. We shall have to keep a watchful eye on things. The protection of the White workers has not been destroyed. It has not been lost because of the abolition of job reservation. In the first instance the hon. the Minister has said he will continue with the job reservation that exists until such time as he can phase it out by way of agreement and reaching an understanding when everybody is convinced that it is no longer necessary. In any case, only five such job reservations remain. In the second place it concerns the Black trade unions. There are a number of our own people who say: &#x201C;Look at the dangers.&#x201D; If we say today that the establishment of Black trade unions does not contain an element of danger, we are not speaking the truth and we are not being honest. Who can stand up here and say that establishing Black trade unions will not be dangerous? But we say that the present state of affairs is even more dangerous. That is the point. It is not in their interests or in the interests of South Africa. As I see it, our Government and the hon. the Minister are well aware of the dangers connected with this, and that is the reason why the hon. the Minister has taken his time and has gone ahead step by step. I can appreciate why hon. Senators on the other side want him to act more quickly. They want to create a furore so that there will be labour unrest. I can understand that But they are not talking in the interests of South Africa. They are talking in the interests of their own party. The Government and the hon. the Minister are looking to the interests of South Africa.</p>
<p>This legislation will also promote labour efficiency. It is also the intention of the legislation to improve labour efficiency, something which is so necessary in South Africa. I am of the opinion that this legislation is within the framework of the policy of the NP. That is how I see it. It will be implemented within the policy of the National Party.</p>

<p>We must not be expected to deviate from that policy. But it does not follow that there will not be adjustments. We are not so stupid and silly as not to make adjustments as time dictates. [Interjections.] I want to appeal today, in the political sphere as well, to hon. Senators as I appeal to other parties to the right of the NP&#x2014;we know there are such parties&#x2014;not to make this a big emotional issue. In this respect we really must keep cool heads. If we want to harm South Africa for political gain in the short-term&#x2014;and it can only be in the short-term&#x2014;we can try to exploit the position and incite people who do not have all the facts at their disposal. There is a tremendous responsibility on this hon. Minister and his department to give all the facts and assurances they can to people so that there can be no propaganda against the direction he has taken. It is unnecessary to say that we can only do it and must do it within the framework of our policy of separate development.</p>
<p>As far as the amendments are concerned that are proposed by the hon. the Minister in clauses 3 and 4, it is still not quite clear to me what is meant by the provision that a trade union may be established for more than one population group and what the ratio between the numbers of employees of the various population groups must be. I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister will give us more clarity on that point and tell us what it really means and under which circumstances he will use it. I accept that the hon. the Minister will use that power with great discretion. I accept that. I do not believe that it will mean the encouragement of further mixed trade unions or, as he calls them, parallel trade unions.</p>
<p>I want to conclude on this note and say that the hon. the Minister has taken a new road. I myself have thought at times that the hon. the Minister has moved too quickly, and I have said this to him too. I make no secret of this. He had difficulty in convincing some of us on all the points. There may be some points on which he has not convinced all of us. As I know him, he will keep his word to employers as well as to employees and he will protect their interests at all times without disregarding the interests of South Africa. Mr. President, if the hon. the Minister does that&#x2014;and I accept that he will do it; I accept that as far as he is able he will protect the interests of the White and the non-White worker at all costs&#x2014;I want to wish him everything of the best because a difficult task confronts him. This is no easy task. He can also rely on us to help him, wherever possible, within the framework of the policy of the NP. As long as he continues to implement that policy carefully and responsibly&#x2014;and he will do that&#x2014;he can rely on us to support and assist him.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, hon. Senators have conducted a very interesting debate today; they have asked numerous questions and I want to thank them most sincerely. I thank them in particular for the way in which they have acted and in this regard I refer to the hon. Senator Crook as well. When I appeared in this House on a previous occasion I was fiercely attacked by him. Today, however, he was fairly reasonable and I thank him for that.</p>
<p>Mr. President, this is not straightforward legislation. Neither is this a straightforward subject. It is something about which one can become very emotional. It is a subject about which one should remain very level-headed because it is a field where we dare not make a mistake. A mistake in regard to evaluation, development, policy, one can almost say timing, in this field can immediately result in something that is counter-productive. However, in future we shall have ample opportunity to discuss this matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>As it is already fairly late in the afternoon, Sir, I just want to refer to a few points raised by hon. Senators because I take it that I shall have the opportunity of replying further to the debate on Monday.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers referred to a matter which is of the utmost importance to both the department and the workers. It is a legitimate complaint that has been there for years, namely that the progress we are making by utilizing Wage Board machinery does not keep pace with present-day requirements. In the case of a steady economy with a growth rate of 1% or 2% it is not necessary for one to revise wages every year, only every second or third year. Under present circumstances, however, wages have to be revised more often. Due to the fast rate of development, however, a serious backlog has built up over the past few years. The hon. Senator mentioned something today in respect of which I have heard many complaints in the past, but I heard most of them after matters had already been rectified. We had, namely, given instructions to the Wage Board which had narrowed down its field of activity. In other words, when we instruct the Wage Board to give its attention to wages and a number of other matters, it covers a wide field which takes up a great deal of time. Usually it does not involve secondary matters, only wages themselves. We decided, therefore, to narrow down the instruction to the Wage Board so as to enable it to complete its task more expeditiously. That is what in fact happened and in many respects from the point of view of time the backlog has been reduced to two or three years at the most I personally am satisfied that the position has improved considerably. I can tell the hon. Senator, therefore, that the position is much better than it was in the past. As a matter of fact, my department and I are trying to improve still further a position which is already good. One must never accept something as being good enough. One must always try to improve it still further.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator raised another point which can be an important technical point. I am pleased that she has put the question to me because many people are anxious to know how the Manpower Commission will be constituted. She concluded&#x2014; as it is stated literally there&#x2014;that the commission will be constituted in such a way that employers and employees will be able to submit nominations and that the members will then be elected. That is not really how it will happen. What do we mean when we say: &#x201C;The Minister will consult and ask the opinion of others?&#x201D; Every sensible Minister does that in any case. The officials of this commission will be appointed on a full-time basis as in the case of any permanent commission. When one wants to appoint the chairman or one or two members one does not ask a member of a trade union or employers&#x2019; organization to serve on the permanent sector of the commission. One may want the member to be a labour economist, a highly qualified person, or a labour expert. One would not ask a trade union who that labour economist should be and one would not ask the employers who that person should be. One appoints that type of person as a member.</p>
<p>What I personally have in mind is the following: Because the commission will be in continuous session with a permanent staff, I do not think it should be too large. It will probably consist of five or six permanent members, although I may change my mind at a later stage. We must, however, give the trade unions and the employers&#x2019; organizations an opportunity of having a say in the matter. To achieve this I believe we should ask the labour and industrial sectors for contributions and we shall then probably have a comprehensive commission that will function occasionally. In other words, if representatives of the two sectors serve on the commission it will become a large commission. On some occasions these representatives will not serve on the commission, whereas the permanent members of the commission will serve permanently on it. If the hon. Senator means that the trade unions and the employers&#x2019; organizations should have some say, I can assure her that that is my intention. In other words, the trade unions and employers&#x2019; organizations will have full opportunity of making meaningful contributions in the planning and consultations of the commission itself. Everyone will have to be present However, they must not expect me to ask the trade union whom I should appoint as permanent members of the commission because as far as that is concerned they cannot make any contribution.</p>

<p>That is fine. The hon. Senator also asked me a question in connection with provisional registration. The hon. Senator should clearly understand what we are doing now. She says this is a new development. It is of course something new. We have planned it and we think it will succeed, but it is a new development. In the past a trade union could canvass members and then register as a trade union. They were either accepted or not. I do think, however, that we have now reached a stage&#x2014;the commission has also recommended this&#x2014;where we can introduce a system of provisional registration. When I say &#x201C;provisional&#x201D; I do not at this stage want to tie myself down to a definite period; &#x201C;provisional&#x201D; may mean for a considerable period. What is meant by provisional registration is the following: Before one gives somebody the right to re cruit members and collect fees, the right to enter a certain field, to exercise control and to become a mouthpiece and instrument in the future that will be very powerful, there should be a period within which the Department can give that person an opportunity of proving that he is up to the task. It is also important that the department should be able to determine during that time whether such a person is the type of client to which it wants to give permission. That is why it is essential to have a period of provisional registration. This will also provide protection, because in this field as well, Sir, there was people who take chances. They simply recruit members left and right, collect fees and then they disappear. The bird flies away, the members lose their money and especially their confidence and this causes great misery. In order to obviate this I think a period of provisional registration is the very instrument that we should build into the legislation so that we can keep a watchful eye on the position and lay down certain conditions. The Minister can also say at any time: &#x201C;I do not like you because you do not have the confidence of the people. I do not like your methods.&#x201D; Or otherwise: &#x201C;I am suspicious about something else, and consequently you will not be permanently registered.&#x201D; In other words, we are introducing a preliminary period. Why are we doing it? Mr. President, we are doing it because we are now taking a second step, namely, of conferring trade union rights on Black workers. By saying that I am not suggesting that Black workers are not good workers or that they may abuse trade union rights. I am not casting that reflection because this is going to apply to everybody. But once we have reached the stage where we want to open the door wider, as we are doing now, I do think we are at least entitled to expect the Minister to be doubly careful. And that is what is intended here. His intentions are good but he also wants to be careful and protective.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The Road Transportation Act, No. 74 of 1977, contains certain concessions to farmers which mean that that particular transportation is not deemed to constitute road transportation. Consequently application does not have to be made for a road transportation permit. I know it is and has always been the normal practice among the farming community to take their farm labourers to town occasionally in their&#x2014;the farmers&#x2019;&#x2014;own vehicles for the purpose of shopping, or to attend church services, funerals and sports meetings. This is, however, contrary to the provision of Act No. 74 of 1977 because such transportation does constitute road transportation and a road transportation permit is necessary for this purpose. Farmers do, however, have a problem in this regard because public transport is not always readily available for such occasions, and in some cases it does not exist at all.</p>
<p>I think hon. Senators will agree with me that the farming community could be accommodated by providing in the Act that the conveyance of farm labourers, when they are conveyed with a farmer&#x2019;s own vehicle between the place where they are being employed in his farming operations and any other place for the purposes of shopping, church attendance, attendance of funerals or any sports or recreational meetings, is not considered to be road transportation. I therefore propose that section 1(2)(b) of Act No. 74 of 1977 be amended by the insertion of paragraph (iiiA).</p>
<p>*Mr. President, when I moved the Second Reading of the Road Transportation Bill which has since become the Road Transportation Act, 1977, I said, <i>inter alia</i>, that the human being is fallible and that I did not want to leave the impression that it would never again be necessary to amend the Act. I should have added that the human being is also ingenious and it is because of his ingenuity that I am today compelled to move the amendment of section 1(2)(1).</p>

<p>Yes, &#x201C;shrewd&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators will remember that section 1(2)(1) was written into the Act as a result of a recommendation by the Commission of Inquiry into the Road Transportation Bill. In paragraph 6.4 of its report the commission felt that a slight concession would solve many of the problems experienced by rural retailers, because as a rule they cannot carry big stocks and have to supplement their stocks frequently. The commission, therefore, recommended the use of a goods vehicle with a carrying capacity not exceeding one thousand kilograms and belonging to a business concern in the course of such a concern&#x2019;s trade to convey its goods anywhere in the country without it being necessary to obtain a permit.</p>
<p>Section 1(2)(1) did, however, not limit the use of the vehicles in question to conveyance of own goods in the course of an industry, trade of business with the result that the conventional 1-ton pick-up is designed and built in such a manner that it does not resemble a pick-up in the faintest and those vehicles are then used to run a cartage contracting service for reward without any permits at the cost of established cartage contractors who had to make out a case before a local road transportation board and who had to pay for their permits.</p>
<p>Those hauliers who are abusing the concession in respect of the goods vehicle with a carrying capacity not exceeding 1 000 kilograms, and which incidentally includes a trailer, are doing it quite legally by manipulating details such as the carrying capacity of a goods vehicle which can obviously carry more than 1 000 kilograms in such a manner that the vehicle is eventually derated to conform to the requirements of section 1(2)(1).</p>
<p>When this matter came to my notice, my first reaction was to delete section 1(2)(1) from Act 74 of 1977. Realizing that the deletion of section 1(2)(1) will be a retrogressive step in the move towards gradual deregulation in the road transportation sphere and bearing in mind that more than 400 vehicles have been specially built by hauliers at a capital cost of approximately R3 million to fall within the 1 000 kilograms carrying capacity range, I instructed the Department of transport to hold discussions with those interested in order to resolve the matter. During the discussions it was agreed that should it be necessary to amend section 1(2)(1), provision should in all fairness be made for a phasing out period during which those hauliers who are using the derated goods vehicles can orientate themselves, either to cease operations with those vehicles or to apply for the necessary road carrier permits. A phasing out period which will lapse on 31 December 1981 was considered to be reasonable.</p>
<p>In the light of the present fuel situation, however, I have decided against a phasing out period, the reasons being that any phasing out period may be influenced by the availability of fuel. In this regard it is to be noted that the conveyance of a 10 000 kg payload by a vehicle with that carrying capacity will consume less fuel than ten vehicles with a carrying capacity of 1 000 kg over the same distance. I have consequently decided that the National Transport Commission should be empowered to consider, in its discretion, applications for public permits in respect of those vehicles which have been derated to qualify for the concession as provided for in clause 1(b) of the Bill.</p>
<p>In order to ensure uniformity in the exercising of such discretion applications will have to be submitted directly to the National Transport Commission and not to local road transportation boards. I may mention in this regard that the proposed amendment of section 1(2)(1) has been discussed with both the Federation of Road Transport Associations and the Transport Consultative Committee. Those hauliers who make use of the concession are members of either or both of these organizations.</p>
<p>Both these bodies, although in favour thereof that a certain measure of control be exercised over the use of these vehicles, expressed concern at the fact that the National Transport Commission would be given the discretion to either grant or refuse authority to those hauliers who have been conveying goods for reward in terms of the section since a date prior to 1 April 1979.</p>
<p>Although I am not in a position to anticipate the decision of the National Transport Commission, I can at least give the assurance that the commission will consider each of these cases on its merits whilst all relevant factors will certainly be taken cognizance of. Here I include factors such as the fact that capital investments have been made by certain hauliers as well as the fact that many people have been employed in the course of these operations. Furthermore I wish to point out that these carriers can, in terms of section</p>
<p>1(2)(x), continue with their business without having to obtain permits if such conveyance is undertaken within an area within a radius of 40 km from the carrier&#x2019;s place of business.</p>
<p>It will be noted from the proposed new paragraph (1A) that the gross vehicle mass as opposed to the carrying capacity in the existing section of the Act is now taken into account to limit goods vehicles to the lighter type, e.g. the well-known &#x00BE;-ton and one-ton pickups. The reason for this is that, as I pointed out earlier, the carrying capacity of a goods vehicle can be manipulated whereas the gross vehicle mass is determined by motor vehicle manufacturers and can, therefore, not be amended at random. By limiting the gross vehicle mass to 2 500 kg, the purpose which was aimed at by the Commission of Inquiry into the Road Transportation Bill is achieved.</p>
<p>This amendment is supported not only by the Federation of Road Transport Associations and the Transport Consultative Committee, but also by the Industrial Advisory Committee, who in fact suggested that section 1(2)(1) be amended to exclude trailers and semi-trailers from the concession and to limit the size of goods vehicles by way of gross vehicle mass instead of carrying capacity.</p>
<p>*As far as the proposed amendments of section 1(2)(w), 1(2)(x) and 1(2)(y) are concerned, the Minister of Transport may by way of regulation prescribe the manner in which the goods may be conveyed within the areas mentioned. The opinion is held that it is desirable that the Minister should also be empowered to prescribe by regulation conditions with regard to this transport.</p>
<p>This opinion stems from a measure of doubt which exists about the legal validity of regulation 2(5) of the Road Transportation Regulations, 1977. It is deemed that this regulation prescribes a condition, and not a manner, while section 1(2)(x) of Act No. 74 of 1977 only mentions the manner prescribed by regulation.</p>
<p>Regulation 2(5) was made to restrict those carriers who, through the establishment of bogus depots on the borders of released areas, in reality extended the released areas by 40 km.</p>
<p>Should it be decided to make limiting regulations, i.e. the laying down of conditions, in respect of sections 1(2)(w) and 1(2)(y) of Act No. 74 of 1977, the same problem will arise since the sections concerned also mention only the manner prescribed by regulation. In view of this it is necessary for sections 1(2)(w), 1(2)(x) and 1(2)(y) of Act No. 74 of 1977 to be amended in such a manner that the Minister may also make conditions by way of regulation.</p>
<p>The conditions to which I am referring, mean that the Minister will be placed in a position, when the said concessions are being abused&#x2014;as is in fact the case with the so-called 1-ton pick-up&#x2014;where he is able to act immediately by amending the regulations where necessary to control the abuse that has been disclosed.</p>

<p>Mr. President, this is probably the last occasion on which the hon. the Minister will pilot a measure through this House and I would like to take the opportunity of expressing our appreciation for the manner in which he has conducted debates over the years. It has always been a pleasure to conduct a debate with this hon. Minister, even where there was a very strong divergence of opinion. I think he is an example to many other hon. Ministers, an example which they could well follow so that even though there may be a wide divergence of opinion, the acrimony that does take place in the case of certain other hon. Ministers could be avoided.</p>
<p>We understand that the hon. the Minister is retiring from the Cabinet and may in fact retire from politics completely. We on this side of the House wish him well. We hope that he and his wife will enjoy a happy, fruitful and long retirement. I am also glad to note that the hon. the Minister will not be coming to this House with a measure which may have disturbed the coolness of debate. I am very glad that he will not be leaving this House with a blemished reputation.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has clarified the purpose of the amending Bill before the House. As he has indicated, it is remarkable to note the extent to which human ingenuity will go in finding loopholes in the law and in finding solutions to difficult problems. Of course, the solution that has to be found in this country, Sir, is how to solve the problem of getting rid of this Government and finding a better one! No doubt, the ingenuity of our human resources in South Africa will solve that problem too in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>As far as the Bill is concerned, it is not necessary for me to go over the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation. But what I am glad to notice is that the amendments are the result of negotiations and discussions with the people concerned. I believe that that is the correct way of solving problems under all circumstances; not to use the big stick and to say &#x201C;You will do this&#x201D; and &#x201C;You will do that&#x201D;, but to negotiate and come to an amicable arrangement whereby a difficulty can be overcome. And that appears to have been the case in this instance.</p>
<p>I am glad to note also that the hon. the Minister has given us the assurance that the National Transport Commission, while it is being given the discretion to agree to the granting of permits to those people who are operating the services or to withdraw those permits, will in fact, consider all these cases on their merits, because although these people, through their ingenuity, have found a loophole in the law, their activities have in fact been legal. They have been perfectly legal otherwise strong action would have been taken against them. They have acquired considerable vested interests both in capital expenditure and the employment of labour, and in many cases they in fact render a valuable service. In debates on the Railway budget I had this sort of service in mind when I stated that the Railways were not equipped for the door-to-door type of service which many of these carriers provided. Of course, if the service is from one main railway centre, i.e. from one town which is served by adequate rail transport to another town, then the Railways with their road delivery service probably cater for the service. This type of service also serves many rural areas with which the Railways have no direct contact and one can get service in respect of spare parts or emergency parcels and goods of one kind or another for which the Railways do not provide a service. This new development has only recently taken place and is now noticeable on many roads. In Natal there are certainly daily services of this nature. They do provide a service which despite the increase in the cost of fuel and the shortage of fuel the Railways will in many cases find difficult to replace. I do trust that adequate consideration will be given to all these factors before using the sword of Damocles and cancelling the permits. However, the hon. the Minister has indicated that he has this sort of approach. I trust that his successor in office will also follow the same approach.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I should like to associate myself with the remarks addressed to the hon. the Minister by the hon. Senator Henderson. It seems to me too that today will be last occasion on which the hon. the Minister will introduce Bills on transport matters in this hon. House.</p>
<p>It has fallen to my lot to participate in most of his debates in this hon. House. When I look back on the course of the debates, there are two particular facets of his style of debating which have struck me.</p>
<p>In the first place the hon. the Minister has always shown his willingness to go into the finest detail in order to convince his opponents. Secondly, I was struck by his technical knowledge, as well as the way in which he prepared himself for the debate so that he could convey the technical details to this hon. House. I remember in particular an occasion where the hon. the Minister was questioned on the noise which certain lorries made at traffic lights. He explained to us how the braking system worked, etc., and why this was the case. I was amazed to learn that day that the hon. the Minister had found time to research the matter so thoroughly and was able to convey it to us so well in this House that we could all understand it.</p>
<p>I should like to relate this technical knowledge of the hon. the Minister to his background. He was apprenticed as a lathe operator in the service of the South African Railways. In addition to this training which he received as an apprentice on the Railways, he took an extramural course in mechanical engineering at the Technical College in Cape Town. I have always felt that there was a certain similarity between myself and the hon. the Minister in this respect. I suggest that this background, together with his experience as a jurist, placed him in a particularly favourable position to hold the portfolio of transport, which he has done with such great success since 1974. His retirement now brings to an end an era in the history of</p>
<p>Parliament, and I believe that I am speaking on behalf of the whole House when I say that we regard his departure with much regret. In saying farewell to him on this occasion, we would like to wish him and his wife everything of the best for the future.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, the hon. Senator Henderson has indicated that in the light of the arguments advanced and explanations given, the Opposition support the measure before the House. I understood him to say that. He has commended the hon. the Minister for his efforts to negotiate with and consult the people concerned. I also agree with him when he says that he hopes that the National Transport Commission will in fact consider each case that is to be examined in terms of paragraph (2)(1) in the light of their particular merits and that the matters will be dealt with as reasonably as possible. We know too that an amendment has been effected extending the date up to which application may be made in respect of existing carriers. We consider this to be a necessary and desirable amendment.</p>
<p>Paragraph (2)(1) was introduced as a result of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into transportation in 1977, principally to provide a measure of concession in respect of rural shopkeepers or dealers because of their need to replenish stocks frequently. Had this concession not been accepted an impossible position would have arisen. This has now apparently been circumvented by the inventiveness of certain people and it has therefore become necessary to amend the Act to prevent this. But in all of this it is evident that we are approaching a new era, we might say the golden era of the Railways because the world energy crisis will now place greater emphasis on the Railways. This is therefore one of the steps among many others that will have to be taken to rationalize the whole national transportation system properly.</p>
<p>Sir, with these few words, on behalf of this side of the House I support this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, as this is quite likely to be the last visit which the hon. the Minister will make to this hon. House in his capacity as Minister of Transport, I should like to agree wholeheartedly with the congratulatory remarks addressed to him by previous speakers. I should like to express my personal appreciation to him for his courtesy and willingness to listen to good arguments in debates in this House.</p>
<p>Then, too, I should like to wish him and Mrs. Muller everything of the best for the future. I hope they will be spared for many years to enjoy the good things of life, for instance, red wine and red meat.</p>
<p>I should like to deviate today from a procedure I normally follow. It is not often that I thank Ministers in the House, but as far as this legislation is concerned I should like to express my thanks to the hon. the Minister for the concession he has made to the farming community. He has also given a good sketch of the purpose for which this legislation was introduced. I welcome that and I hope the public will realize what the farming community are doing for their workers and their servants. We are in the difficult position that we do not have all the facilities the city dwellers have, for instance, to take a sick person to a doctor or to take people to a larger centre where they can do their shopping. We should therefore like to thank the hon. the Minister sincerely for the concession and if in the past organized agriculture might have spoken harsh words about the Minister, this concession will bring about a change for the better in their attitude, and I am sure that all of them would also like to wish him everything of the best for the future.</p>
<p>†As far as the second leg of this Bill is concerned, I would like to support it in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister has obviously consulted all the interested parties, and also in view of the fuel situation in the country.</p>
<p>*Once again I should like to wish the hon. the Minister everything of the best for the future.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want to start off by saying that I too will support this legislation. I am not a great lover of the Road Transportation Act, because I believe it is out of place in a free capitalist society. I understand the historical reasons for it and I do not intend, at this late stage, to start a debate across the floor in regard to the Act itself. Nevertheless, I support this legislation because the hon. the Minister has advanced cogent reasons for it. The one that always impresses me most when I hear a Minister speak in regard to legislation, is when he is able to recite the amount of consultation that has taken place between the affected people and his Department. That always impresses me, because it at least shows that the other sides have been heard and that their views and their problems have been dealt with.</p>
<p>I am a little concerned about a report in a Sunday newspaper about heavy truck drivers who claim that because of the refusal to renew permits many of them are going to be in serious financial straits. I think this may be an opportunity for the hon. the Minister to perhaps make a short reply to this statement I do not know the truth or the validity of it and I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would say something about it.</p>
<p>With these few words in regard to this legislation let me add immediately that the way this particular Bill has been presented to us does not surprise me coming from this particular Minister. In the years that I have spent in both Chambers, I, who have a reputation for clashing with many Ministers many times, think I have clashed with this particular Minister fewer times than with most. I think this is not due to any credit on my part but on the part of the hon. the Minister himself. His response has always been to deflate any attempt to put heat into a debate. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I am sorry to see him leave. I believe he not only added a great deal of status to the most difficult portfolio which he held, but that he graced this Parliament with a great deal of distinction. With these words I wish him a long and happy retirement if that is what he chooses. I hope that our association will continue despite the fact that he has left these halls and has moved into another sphere.</p>

<p>By your leave, Mr. President, I too should like to address a few words to my colleague, Minister Muller, on his final appearance here.</p>
<p>It is probably not granted to all Ministers to depart with so many words of goodwill addressed so spontaneously from all sides of the House as has been the case here today. Consequently I think there is very great appreciation for this on his part, knowing in particular that this testimony of goodwill was made very sincerely and spontaneously. This came about because the life and the conduct of this hon. Minister in this Parliament has been such that both sides of the House are sorry that he will no longer be here to introduce his legislation. There are few people to whom it has been granted to take their leave in this way. Unfortunately the Leader of the Senate is not here today and that is why I should like to say on his behalf to the hon. the Minister that we are very grateful for and appreciative of what he has done, not only because of his competence, but for the exceptional way in which he co-operated and dealt with his legislation. The Government, too, could look on with pride and confidence when he stood up to handle a matter. I think my colleague can leave this House with the thought that everybody was extremely sorry when he took this step and that he listened only to words of goodwill. I can well understand why hon. Senators were not really inclined to discuss the legislation today. They preferred to express their goodwill to the Minister.</p>
<p>Mr. President, on behalf of the Leader of the Senate and all of us here I want to say that the good wishes extended to the hon. the Minister, are the good wishes we also extend to Mrs. Muller. She has stood by him, and we hope that the two of them will have a long life of joy and prosperity together and that it will be as successful as it has been up to now. My very best wishes accompany my colleague.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-transport">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, in the first place I should like to deal with the legislation and the remarks made about it.</p>
<p>I am grateful to hon. Senators for giving this legislation their support. As far as road transportation is concerned, I want to say that this industry is entering a period of great uncertainty. This fact also has a bearing on the matter raised by the hon. Senator Winchester. I am not sure what precisely appeared in the newspapers, but if it was in the Sunday papers, I would advise the hon. Senator to read a book on Sundays instead. Had I known what it was all about, I would have been in a better position to reply. Nevertheless, I think I am right when I guess that it has to do with the decision to curtail road transportation. These cuts were decided on as a result of the oil crisis in which we find ourselves. The position not only creates a problem for South Africa, but in recent times it has become a problem for the whole world. At the moment there is a lot of uncertainty in regard to our fuel supplies. As a result an authoritative committee has been appointed to attempt to apply fuel-saving measures where possible. One of these measures is the provision that road transportation permits should be cut by 20% over the next six months. It has been decided to cut temporary permits by 90%. Similarly the Railways has undertaken on its part, to bring about a reduction of approximately 20% in its road transportation.</p>
<p>In addition to these measures decisions have been taken in regard to a great diversity of other proposals. It has been decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the electrification programme of the Railways should be speeded up so that the main routes, i.e. Johannesburg and Durban, Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg and Cape Town will be fully electrified as soon as possible. These are the circumstances which have forced us to take certain decisions with regard to road transportation. In all fairness I must say that over the last few days I have spent a lot of time on the road between Cape Town and my constituency, and I think that a lot of the traffic using fuel today could, if it really becomes necessary, be carried by the Railways using electrical or even steam traction.</p>
<p>The Secretary for Transport and chairman of the National Transport Commission has just informed me that he will hold discussions this afternoon with all the chairmen of local road transportation boards to discuss the matter in depth. He gives me the assurance that there will be uniform action and there will be no unreasonableness. But basically the problem is simply and solely the availability of fuel and as a result there is a cloud of uncertainty over road transportation from now on. We shall simply have to adapt to the circumstances which are forced on us.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I should like in a few words to express my sincere appreciation to hon. Senators for the very nice things they had to say about me, as well as to my colleague next to me, the hon. Minister of Labour, and the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell. I include the hon. Senators on the other side who spoke.</p>
<p>†I refer to the hon. Senator Henderson, the hon. Senator Winchester and the hon. Senator Du Toit.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you, Mr. President, that I am leaving Parliament without regrets, because I have reason to believe that I have had my fair share. We all know what has happened during the past few days, and if I were to tell you that there was no disappointment whatsoever as far as I am concerned regarding the nomination in the NP caucus for the presidency, I would be dishonest; I could be called a liar. I was disappointed, but I am over it I think I have had a very full life. More than 44 years ago I started on the Railways as an apprentice turner and machinist, and from that humble position during the depression days when we were all very poor&#x2014;and I was particularly poor&#x2014;I have progressed to become the Minister of Transport What have I to complain about? Nothing whatsoever! I have had more than my due.</p>
<p>*I take my departure with great happiness and without any frustrations; I no longer have any ambitions. I am going to lead a more tranquil life and I leave this place with the knowledge that I have enjoyed a large measure of co-operation and pleasure in this Parliament. I have enjoyed it, and occasionally it was my pleasure to pilot very im portant legislation through Parliament. I had wonderful co-operation from my party over the years and to a large extent&#x2014;sometimes we clashed on political issues&#x2014;I have also had kindness and co-operation from the other side. For this I should like to express my highest appreciation. This is the highest institution in our country and we must at all time uphold its traditions and conventions in the interests of our country and its people.</p>
<p>I said in the Other Place that this was a peculiar place in this sense that many people have a strong desire to get here, and just cannot get here. Many want to be here and they do not succeed; it is difficult to get here. But if one has been here for 18 years, as I have, then it is also difficult to leave, and sometimes it is harder to leave than it was to come here. For your words, Mr. President, and for those of my colleague on my left and all the hon. Senators, my very sincere thanks. I am now going to have a good rest.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-labour">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, at the conclusion of the discussion last week I made certain remarks with reference to matters raised during the debate by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. I should like to carry on where I left off and return to one point which she made. She had raised a matter that had also been raised by other hon. Senators, in connection with the definition of an employee. We say now that an employee is a person who is White, Coloured, an Asian or a Black and who has the right to reside and has permanent employment in South Africa. A debate has resulted from this both here and outside, and I can therefore appreciate why hon. Senators would like greater clarity on this matter. I did intend clarifying this matter, regardless of the fact that hon. Senators commented on the matter and asked for an explanation.</p>
<p>May I just consider the history of this matter for a while. In the formulation of policy as well as legislation a government sometimes needs time to so formulate it that it can be regarded as watertight for the purpose for which it was introduced. It must be remembered that the legislation was introduced because of a report that was tabled at a rather late stage. This is one of those sensitive matters in regard to which my department and I feel that we have not had sufficient time to consider it well enough to enable us to give hon. Senators a final reply in regard to that formulation. When we first began to think about and look at the implications, and began to deal with the great diversity of possibilities and problems which could arise, we decided to keep the formula fairly narrow for this year&#x2019;s legislation, and to lay down two requirements, which I have already mentioned, viz. that a person must live here and must have permanent work. I realize that if we put it that way, for reasons which I myself see and am aware of, the formula will be too narrow for the purpose. Because we have not had sufficient time to look at it closely, however, I myself have said publicly on various occasions, particularly when talking to employees and employers about it, that these points need not be argued with me, and that I know the arguments both for and against it equally well. I raised this point in Durban when I addressed a meeting of about 900 to 1 000 employers. I also said that my reason for defining it so narrowly at this stage was purely technical. I can think of a great diversity of problems which must first be sorted out. I can think of problems which would affect a variety of people; the fact that some of them live in an independent country and others in a non-independent country. There is the problem that one might have a strike situation before we could make the necessary prior arrangements for solving it. We have the problem of migrant labourers, some of whom even come from outside South Africa. In the case of some of them the period they may work in South Africa is laid down as 18 months and even less than 18 months. Some of these migrant labourers go home but do not return. Hon. Senators can see therefore that there is a wide range of circumstances. Before I brought this legislation to the House I said that we had to make provision for exemptions. I realize at this stage that I shall have to grant immediate exemptions to workers from certain places. I myself mentioned Durban, because the position in Durban is such that some people live within a few kilometres of their work. It is unthinkable that we should in future exclude all the people who live in Kwa Mashu for example. If we exclude them we shall also have to exclude them from certain benefits, benefits accruing from trade union membership. I have opened the door in advance by saying: Look, as soon as the legislation is on the Statute Book, I shall immediately say to what extent we can grant exemptions in the uncomplicated cases.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators will concede that we shall have to give careful consideration to a diversity of cases. As I have said at various places, this is one of the spheres in which I shall have to introduce supplementary legislation as soon as possible. All I ask is the necessary time for consideration to decide how that legislation should be formulated. I do not want to commit myself to a formulation, Sir; I do not want to lay down a formula now and then come back next year and say we made a mistake. I would rather have the discretion now to expand the formula as time dictates and to come forward at some future date with a final formula.</p>
<p>In other words, hon. Senators should not read into this any ulterior motive to exclude certain workers permanently. Hon. Senators must see this as an opportunity which the Minister is requesting to do it in this way, because he has had too little time to study the problems, problems which cropped up after he had started framing the legislation and after various problems were submitted to him. That is why I say to hon. Senators that this formula will not remain like this. If we had received the report three or four months sooner, and if we had had the time required to sort out the problems, I might not have had to ask hon. Senators to be patient so that I could come back to them later with another formula. That is why I want to repeat what I have already said, and I say this to certain Black trade unions as well. They need not worry; as soon as we are able to do so I shall meet them and ask them to submit applications for exemption. There will be easy matters which will not cause any problems, and when there are difficult cases, they will be dealt with as accommodatingly as possible. I hope hon. Senators will accept my explanation in this connection.</p>
<p>There are a few other ideas I should like to elucidate further, ideas in regard to which we must understand one another. The one is not so much an idea, but rather the concept of the restructuring of work in the labour situation. What will we be faced with in future, Mr. President? We shall be confronted with a situation in the next few years where millions of people will enter the labour field. These millions of people all have the right to a place in the economy and the economy will have to make provision for this. If our economy does not provide for the employment of so many workers and people capable of work, a situation will develop in South Africa where a large number of people will be unemployed, and unemployment is the greatest danger which can threaten a country like South Africa. We shall have to try and avoid unemployment at all costs. If this country&#x2019;s economy grows&#x2014;at the moment it is still too low&#x2014;and gains full momentum, it will have a growth rate of 5% or 6%, or perhaps more. And if that happens we shall be faced with another sort of shortage, viz. a shortage of trained people. As things are today, in a period of recession we already have a shortage of trained people in many fields. Can you imagine what the position would be, Sir, when our economy grows at a rate of 4%, 5% or even 6% in the years ahead and there is an ever-increasing gap between the supply of trained persons and the demand for trained persons? If we are not in a position to provide that training, South Africa will be left behind and we shall not be able to participate in the growth which lies ahead. We shall not be able to use that growth to develop opportunities for the employment of the many millions who are going to enter the labour market. A question arises from this: While we are making provision for all workers in the country to participate in labour organizations, in other words, in that apparatus which will be available to decide their weal and woe on the factory floor, what do we do about the fear which so many people have&#x2014;I am thinking in particular of the Coloureds and the Whites &#x2014;that they are going to be ousted in future. That is a very important fear which we must bear in mind, and I mentioned this in the Other Place as well. The question then arises: Which institution shall determine who works where? Which institution shall have to determine what rights may be developed by the workers of the future? Sir, I say that that institution is the worker-cum-employer-cum-Government combined, and the place where it must be done is at the round table of the Industrial Conciliation Board. They will have to negotiate with one another. If it takes place there, one will have to understand clearly that a principle will have to be incorporated which is also a protection. This principle is also a responsibility, viz. the responsibility of the employee of ensuring that the vast economic machine keeps going, that a place should be made for people of colour who are still unable to do so to take their place in the economy. Provision must therefore be made for the employee to play an important part in the restructuring of the future labour pattern. In other words, in the future restructuring of the labour situation, the reply to the question of where the people will work and at what rate they will progress must be given in co-operation with the employees of South Africa. That is why the Government and I say today that in the restructuring of the labour situation the employer and the employee must accept equal responsibility in determining who shall work where and this will constitute a built-in protection for the employee. That restructuring will have to take place in co-operation with the employee.</p>
<p>And what does the legislation before us say? This legislation provides in various ways that the employee will have a say in who shall work where. That is an integral part of this legislation. The principle is the protection of a worker&#x2019;s rights, not job reservation. Job reservation is only a method of doing this. Previously we thought that we could protect the worker by making statutory provision for who could work where. This fulfilled a function in the past, Sir, but in today&#x2019;s situation it no longer fulfils that function. Therefore, in its place, it will be possible to work out meaningful workers&#x2019; protection through the participation of the worker himself. If hon. Senators look at the legislation, they will see that various possibilities have been built in for the worker to protect himself. In other words, round the conference table of the Industrial Council the worker will be able to decide, by way of agreement, what part of the work he relinquishes to somebody else who did not do it in the past In other words, he must also help to bear that responsibility. He has now been given the instrument of an industrial court as well as a National Manpower Commission. This commission will also be able to give advice in future on the important question of irregular or unfair labour practices. So if a labour practice were to develop there is an organization which can be consulted and to whom it can be said: &#x201C;Here is a labour practice; an incorrect tendency is developing&#x201D;. I lay a charge and I seek my rights there, and that organization must then come back to the Minister to declare that labour practice undesirable and to prohibit it, or to prohibit it by way of a judgement. In other words, we make this principle an integral part of the whole legislation and we say that in future the concept of an undesirable labour practice can develop and that it will be part of the future outlook. A Minister can step in and say: &#x201C;Restore the situation to what it was&#x201D;, or &#x201C;restore a person or a group of persons to their former positions&#x201D;. I now want to give you an example of what could happen. Should there be a tendency on the part of a certain manufacturer to eliminate people one by one over a long period and to put other people in their place, and a tendency is discerned, a complaint could be lodged in the following terms: &#x201C;Look, I notice a tendency here; here a number of people who were employed and who have been eliminated one after the other, and this must be stopped.&#x201D; The situation can be examined to see if it is a justified or unjustified tendency. In other words, instead of the Minister prescribing who shall work where, both employer and employee will in future decide who should work where. This has one very important advantage, which is that employees will no longer be able to think that they can merely hold a pistol to the employer&#x2019;s head and threaten him with the Minister by asking the Minister to introduce job reservation. No responsibility is taken. As somebody said to me once: It has nothing to do with me if the industry suffers; whether the employer is able to find other employees has nothing to do with me; that is his business and not mine; all I say is that I want to be protected. That is not the right attitude to adopt either, for if an employer wants to expand his business, and he does not have the people, then surely the right thing to do is to call employers and employees together and say to them: &#x201C;Look, I want to expand,&#x201D; or: &#x201C;There is a tendency for me to lose people; let us have a sensible decision as to which of the existing work you will keep, and which we can give to other people whom we still have to find.&#x201D; In other words, that is meaningful &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Very well, then. As far as the question of protection is concerned, I find it more meaningful too now because it also entails more responsibility. I cannot imagine that it would be right for a workers&#x2019; corps to deny work to a co-worker and simply to demand protection from the Government and employers without tendering any co-operation in the whole process of the restructuring of work.</p>
<p>I can mention as example something which happened last year, when the iron and steel industry entered into an agreement The Minister did not tell them what form the agreement should take. They negotiated their own agreement and what I am going to tell you about now they negotiated on their own initiative. When they came out the other side they were completely satisfied that they had agreed and decided for themselves where they would work, which work could be relinquished, and there was general satisfaction. In other words, what I am telling you now has already been demonstrated in practice.</p>
<p>I want to go further and say that the case I am now putting to the Senate is a matter which has been thoroughly discussed and thrashed out with the trade unions. They appreciate it, and the reason why there is a large measure of support today for the legislation, in the labour community as well, is because the labour community is satisfied that there are sufficient built-in protective measures. These protective measures are framed in such a way that they need not have the negative effect of keeping others out. In other words, in a changing economy one must build in protection as well as mobility. A person must know that he can also help decide his own fate, and that is precisely what we are doing here. That is why I am satisfied that together with what we are now envisaging here, we must also incorporate a protective measure for the workers of South Africa because I feel that they must enjoy the protection to which they are entitled. There must be co-responsibility to help determine the labour situation of the future and to work together so that everybody will have a place on the factory floor.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser said, <i>inter alia</i>, that we should move slowly and that we should be careful. Of course we must be careful. There is no situation as explosive as the labour situation. This is not a situation where confidence can be lost If a Minister were to act in such a way in the labour situation that he did not gain the confidence of the workers, he could never hope to have peace and tranquillity on the labour front. To instil confidence in one another and to expect it of one another is also one of the objectives of this legislation.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser said we should not throw the White people to the wolves. No one is going to be thrown to the wolves. Whites will not be thrown to the wolves. Obviously a Minister would be unreasonable if he were to act in such a way that he threw his people who were an integral part of a labour situation to the wolves. To tell the truth, I never use the words &#x201C;thrown to the wolves&#x201D;. They never occur to me because they constitute a negative statement As far as I am concerned, I think we must see the matter positively for the future and must talk of how we can reorganize the labour scene in South Africa meaningfully so that everyone will have his place and will not feel threatened by anyone else.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser also asked me to move slowly. Yes, one cannot move more rapidly in this field than the rate at which one is able to take people along with one, and this also applies to the employees. I cannot move more rapidly in this field than the employees are prepared to go along with me. Up to now I have had very staunch support from the employee organizations, and for this I am very grateful. Consequently I want to give the assurance that any action taken will be taken with the greatest degree of sympathy and we shall try to allay the fears and to make the major principle of self-protection and co-protection an integral part of the legislation. I am pleased that this House and the Other Place agree with me, in fact that the whole country agrees with me, including trade unions, that section 77 can be deleted and that instead of section 77 we should have something which can be established to our own satisfaction, and which will embody a dynamic facet in the whole labour situation in South Africa. That is why I want to give the assurance that we shall act with the greatest caution and sympathy. I also want to tell the Senate that we shall introduce further legislation in future but I shall not introduce any legislation if the matter has not been thrashed out and settled with the existing trade unions. During recent months I have talked to the representatives of literally hundreds of thousands of people for days on end. We have given one another reciprocal assurances. I am satisfied that I can say today that by far the greatest majority of organized labour in South Africa supports this legislation. If that confidence continues and we can negotiate with one another with the necessary collaboration and sympathy and produce legislation which will give satisfaction, we shall succeed in future in preserving a labour situation which has been maintained up to now in peace and tranquillity. I am convinced, Mr. President, that in the years which lie ahead we shall handle this situation with the greatest circumspection and sympathy. If we do not do that, as I said the other day, a clash on the labour floors in South Africa will develop immediately into a White-Black conflict, and I want to avoid that at all costs.</p>
<p>I thank hon. Senators for their patience and I think that in replying to specific questions put to me, and the assurances I have given as to what will happen in the future, I have satisfied this hon. House.</p>

<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>
<p>Clause 1:</p>
<speech by="#scheepers">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in no way do I doubt the undertaking given by the hon. the Minister that he will treat the matter of membership sympathetically, but we feel so strongly about this clause that we cannot agree to it in its present form. I want therefore to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On page 2, in line 26, to omit all the words after &#x201C;Africa,&#x201D; up to and including &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; on page 4, in line 10.</block>
<p>I pointed out during the Second Reading debate how difficult it will be to carry out the provisions of this clause. I do not want to repeat what I have already said, but I must point out that I was correct not only in regard to the feelings of the Black trade unions but also in regard to those of a very large number of the registered trade union movements. As I expected, the reaction of the Black trade unions has been very sharp and according to a report in yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Times</i> some of them have stated that they are not going to register. Here a serious clash can take place because these unions could formerly not be registered. They acted as unregistered trade unions all along. I pointed out to the hon. the Minister that certain of these unions had achieved benefits for their members. Although they were unregistered they covered all the workers in a given industry. I can see that the hon. the Minister is sympathetic particularly in regard to some of the commuters, and on that we have very strong feelings. If there are people who are still outside in independent states, we feel this is a matter that can be delayed, but as far as the commuters are concerned I do not think we can delay the matter because it will cut the membership of some of the trade unions by a considerable amount and it will certainly lead to unrest if these workers are told that they cannot belong to the unions any longer and therefore cannot enjoy the benefits for which they had paid over all these years. What will the Minister do should these unions refuse to register under the circumstances? According to the <i>Sunday Times</i> the Black unions are going to make representations to the hon. the Minister and I hope that at this late stage we will be able to come to some agreement with the hon. the Minister in regard to exemptions. I suggested in my Second Reading speech that the hon. the Minister should exempt all present members of trade unions so that they do not lose their membership and benefits that they have enjoyed for a very long time.</p>
<p>In terms of the Bill unregistered trade unions will not be able to continue. I agree with the principle that unregistered trade unions should not be able to operate providing that their desires are met in the same way as those of other trade unions; that they will not be forced to give up their present membership, and that there will not be any division between organized workers and unorganized commuters or migrant workers. As I pointed out, I feel that we will have to give some thought to the matter as far as the migrant workers are concerned. I shall therefore not press that point too strongly. But as far as the commuters are concerned we must press very, very strongly because some of these people have been members of their trade unions for 30 years or longer.</p>
<p>People both here and abroad were most impressed with the Wiehahn report. I sent some reports overseas and the reaction was very favourable from those who received it. They felt that at last we were starting on the right track.</p>
<p>I wish to tell hon. Senators that I feel I cannot reply to those people and tell them about the provisions of the legislation because they will consider it a big bluff on the part of the Government. Unfortunately, the blame will not only be laid at the door of the Government but also at the door of White South Africa. We are all going to suffer as a result and, if we do take steps to try to overcome these problems in respect of Black/ White relationships, nobody will believe us until we prove that we have done it. To send them reports and to explain to them that things are improving will not help in the least because it has happened time and again that good reports, like the Theron Commission Report, were published and nothing was done. In respect of this Bill I personally had great hopes that something positive was going to materialize. When I spoke about the report of the commission I paid tribute to the hon. the Minister. I know that the hon. the Minister is not having an easy time because one always hears rumblings from his side of the House. But we have to consider what is in the best interests of South Africa and all its people. Even the hon. Senator Dr. Loock admitted that there was so much pressure from abroad that we cannot afford to let this situation continue any longer.</p>
<p>We have always maintained that there can be no justification for the fact that when there are jobs available the colour of a person&#x2019;s skin prevents him from taking those jobs. As far as the membership of trade unions is concerned, I am very pleased that the principle of recognized Black trade unions has now been accepted. But now we come with all the frills that spoil the whole thing. I want to ask the hon. the Minister not to allow the outside world to consider White South Africans as being crooks and dishonest people; that we only talk about doing away with discrimination but that in actual fact we do very little. They will maintain that we are either trying to hoodwink them or that we are underestimating their intelligence. In the light of this I ask the hon. the Minister to accept the amendment so that the Bill will be more acceptable to all concerned, namely the registered White trade unions, the Black trade unions, the overseas trade unions and the International Labour Organization. I intend speaking later on the principles they have adopted. Freedom of association means freedom for all people and I hope the hon. the Minister will allow Black workers the same freedom of association as White workers. People living in the border areas, although they are regarded as being resident in homelands, are part and parcel of this Republic. They are part of the Republic and even if they commute daily to White South Africa they should be included in the provisions of this Bill now and not at a later stage.</p>

<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I am going to make the assumption that in speaking to clause 1, and in particular to the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D;, this brings in the whole question of freedom of association. I hope I will not be in conflict with the Chair when I speak widely on this question. This is how I see the position. In his earlier remarks today I understood the hon. the Minister to say that the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; was really basic to the difficulties he was experiencing not simply from this side of the House but more especially from his own side.</p>
<p>I was very pleased that the hon. the Minister dealt with the question of Durban. He will recollect that in my speech during the Second Reading debate I dealt specifically with the situation at Kwa Mashu and the situation at Newcastle. On that occasion I mentioned that it appeared from a report I read in the Press that as few as 3% of the Black workers in the greater Durban area would in fact enjoy rights under this Bill when it becomes law. I understood the hon. the Minister to say that I was incorrect as far as that was concerned.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-labour">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>It is more than 3%.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>I accept that, but it would be interesting to know what the percentage of Blacks in greater Durban will be who will be able to enjoy the rights accorded under this Bill. If the hon. the Minister has that percentage I would be very grateful to him if he could advise us what it is.</p>
<p>I understood the hon. the Minister this afternoon to give an assurance that he would take into consideration the peculiar position of the Kwa Mashu workers. I trust that that means that the Kwa Mashu workers will obtain blanket exemption which the hon. the Minister is empowered to grant in terms of this Bill. I do not know if that is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention. He did not say so and I would like to know what his intention is. He will probably say that every case will be considered on its merits, and in that case the hon. the Minister will probably have to consider the case of almost 200 000 Black workers in Natal. As I read the Wiehahn Commission Report and the figures contained in it, about 200 000 people are affected as frontier commuters. When the hon. the Minister is considering this matter I would like to know if he is going to give a blanket exemption to that class of person.</p>
<p>I also mentioned to the hon. the Minister that the same position applied as regards the workers in Newcastle. I imagine that no more than 3% of the workers in Newcastle will receive the benefits of the Bill unless an exemption is granted to the commuters from Madadeni who commute a mere 3 km or 4 km in some cases to the Iscor works. It is from here that the whole labour force of Newcastle is drawn, with the exception of some Blacks who are living on private premises and who work as domestic servants. I do feel that a very strong case has been made out for them and I trust that the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to give a blanket exemption as far as these people are concerned.</p>
<p>I am glad that the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers referred to a report in the business section of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> I will deal with this matter again in the Third Reading debate. What is said in that report in the <i>Business Times</i> is very disturbing indeed. I treat much that we read in the <i>Sunday Times</i> with a good deal of circumspection &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, and much of what I read in other newspapers as well, including <i>Die Vaderland.</i> As far as the business portion of the <i>Sunday Times</i> is concerned I do not think politics enter into it at all. I think it would be unfair of anybody to maintain that this is so. If this report, which I have before me, is in fact correct, then it is a very disturbing thing indeed. I intend to deal with this matter further at the Third Reading if I have an opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>I am somewhat staggered to see that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser is not with us this afternoon. I greatly regret it because I understood him to ask the hon. the Minister certain questions and the hon. the Minister will not be able to reply to those questions. He might well not be here for some reason that is not clear to me, but I mention it because I was greatly surprised&#x2014;as were all the hon. Senators on this side of the House&#x2014; firstly, that the hon. Senator L. J. van den Bergh whom I have always understood to be the spokesman on the Nationalist benches on matters of labour sat in his seat and did not utter a word when the Second Reading was dealt with on Friday, and secondly, that he, too, is not here this afternoon. We can of course draw certain conclusions which might be unfair, from the absence of these hon. gentlemen, but as far as the hon. Senator Dr. Visser is concerned, no unfair conclusions need be drawn. He made it perfectly clear during the Second Reading debate what his views on this matter were. I have his Hansard before me. The hon. the Minister dealt to a certain extent with what the hon. Senator Dr. Visser had said, but the hon. Senator Dr. Visser took this matter very far indeed. I would have liked to have had a little exchange of views with him this afternoon, which I shall now not be able to have.</p>

<p>Failing the hon. Senator Dr. Visser, I think it would be only fair if we on this side of the House knew the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s view on what he said. Unfortunately, I can only quote from the copy of his Hansard speech. But he said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Hulls weet mos &#x2026;</block>
<p>Here I interpolate that &#x201C;hulle&#x201D; is ourselves, the Opposition&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; gemengde vakbonde is nie ons beleid nie.</block>
<p>Of course, I asked a question on that matter and got an unsatisfactory reply which I shall not pursue. He said further on&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Hierdie Regering is nie te vinde vir integrasie in die vakbondwese nie. Ons is natuurlik ten gunste van die uitskakeling van diskriminasie maar die verwydering van diskriminasie beteken nie integrasie nie.</block>
<p>And then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Ons beleid het nog deurgaans afsonderlike vakbonde behels. Edele Senatore kla dan oor vrye assosiasie. Hulls sê dan juis daar is nie vrye assosiasie nie. Ek erken dit en nou wil hulle sê daar is vrye assosiasie.</block>
<p>Then he continues a little further on&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Ek neem aan &#x2026;</block>
<p>And this is why I have quoted at length, because here comes the sting&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Ek neem aan die party en die Regering en die Minister is daarteen gekant dat ons beleid op integrasie moet uitloop. Ons is gekant teen totale vermenging. Ek is vierkantig daarteen.</block>
<p>I say this because the question I put to the hon. gentleman related to the White Paper in regard to free association. [Interjections.] I asked whether I could discuss free association</p>

<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Just you have a little patience and you will learn what I am referring to. I want to deal now with this question of freedom of association and that portion of the White Paper dealing with this very question. It is headed &#x201C;freedom of association&#x201D; and appears on page 11. I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On the principle of &#x201C;freedom of association&#x201D; and the membership of trade unions the commission&#x2019;s majority recommendation is that:<br/>both trade union organizations and individuals should be afforded full freedom of association in that individuals should be free to join any appropriate trade union of their choice and that trade unions should be free to prescribe such membership qualifications in their constitutions as they may deem fit, whether or not race, colour or sex is a consideration; that any trade union which meets the requirements for registration in the restructured system should irrespective of colour, race or sex of its members be eligible for registration and full participation in the statutory bargaining and dispute prevention and settlement machinery.</block>
<p>Now, this recommendation is accepted with reservations, says the White Paper. I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">While the Government fully agrees with the principle of freedom of association as the basis for trade union membership reliance must be placed on the guidance of the National Manpower Commission and the judgment of the Minister as far as its implementation is concerned. In the Government&#x2019;s view the most important need of the day is to give Black workers who are in permanent jobs and who therefore constitute a permanent part of the labour force access to machinery which was in the first instance developed for and is being utilized by South Africa&#x2019;s permanent labour force.</block>
<p>[Interjection.] Yes, it is very interesting. I shall tell you why it is interesting. A tittle further it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Government&#x2019;s decision at this juncture accordingly is that all persons irrespective of race, colour or sex who enjoy permanent residence in South Africa and who are in fixed employment will automatically be eligible for trade union membership.</block>
<p>Now, Sir, I mention all this for no other reason than that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser has said that this is not the policy of the NP. We have it clearly here that either the White Paper is talking a lot of bunkum and should never have been printed, or the White Paper when it says that this is what is accepted by the Government is telling us that this is Government policy. I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say that I think the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers set it out very well. But I want to say something else to the hon. the Minister. I am impressed with his sincerity; I am impressed with his knowledge of the subject and I am impressed with his intentions. But I am not impressed with his Bill. We know through long experience&#x2014;any of us who have sat here for any length of time should know&#x2014;that it is what is contained in the legislation that counts, not what the hon. the Minister says. For instance, the hon. the Minister says that he is most sympathetic in regard to migrant workers, that he knows that this is a tremendous problem, one of historical proportions. I accept all that. But, Mr. Chairman, that is not in the Bill. Nowhere in the Bill does it say that the hon. the Minister will come in a few months time, in the next session of Parliament, and change or amend the Bill that is now before us. There is no guarantee whatsoever that any of the things the hon. the Minister said will in due course be carried out. I will accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s word; I will accept his intentions, but you know, Mr. Chairman, that he may not even be the Minister of Labour in a few weeks time or in a few days&#x2019;s time. It could be anybody else with the reshuffling that is taking place in the Cabinet. It could be any Tom, Dick or Harry who takes over from this Minister. This Minister is a capable Minister of Labour. I personally would be sorry to see him go. While that Government is in power I believe he does a very good job. I believe he does talk to the people and not at them. So, Mr. Chairman, I am not saying this in any derogatory sense and neither do I have any wish to quarrel with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intentions or integrity. But what I am saying Sir, is how in heaven&#x2019;s name can he ask me to support legislation which is only in the words out of his mouth and not in the printed document before me? The printed document before me, in fact, excludes the vast majority of the Durban labour force&#x2014;whether it be 3%, 4%, 5% or 10% is neither here nor there. The vast majority of the Durban labour force are being victimized by this legislation. The hon. the Minister says it is a problem; he accepts that and he intends to do something about it. But I am asked to vote for a clause which does not contain a single word of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intentions or promises.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-labour">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>But there is a reason for allowing the Minister a discretion.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>But the Minister may not be this particular hon. Minister in a few weeks&#x2019; time. I have had personal experience of dealing with a particular Minister in respect of a particular problem. The Minister changes his portfolio or leaves the Cabinet and the new Minister says he knows nothing about any undertakings given to me by the previous Minister. The new Minister is not tied down to anything promised by the previous Minister. [Interjections.] Hon. Senators opposite can mutter as much as they like; they swallow hook, line and sinker everything told to them in their caucus meetings. They do not impress me one bit, Sir.</p>
<p>Where the hon. the Minister also disappoints me, Sir, despite the high regard I have for him, is that when one looks at the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own memorandum one notices that that does not tie up entirely with what appears in the printed document with which we are dealing. I shall deal with that in a moment.</p>
<p>I think the Wiehahn Report is certainly the most important document on labour that we have had for many, many years in South Africa. As previous hon. Senators have said, it created a tremendous impression overseas. It created the impression overseas that at last South Africa was beginning to enter the modern age, the twentieth century, in regard to its labour legislation. Not that there is so much wrong with the labour legislation, Sir, except for the fact that it has been tainted and hog-tied by racial discrimination. But the report we had before us gave the world the impression that we were going to move into a new era in South Africa. The hon. the Minister used the exact words when he addressed this House. He uses those words when he talks to the public. But in respect of the question of union rights for migrant workers, for example, there is a majority view which this Bill ignores completely. The majority view was that no restrictions or qualifications should be placed on eligibility for trade union membership. That view is ignored in this Bill and the minority view is accepted. The Commission does not accept Mr. Nieuwoudt&#x2019;s view which says that &#x201C;no Black migrant workers should have registered or unregistered trade union rights&#x201D; but that view is accepted in the Bill. The hon. the Minister, has in fact, accepted the minority view. The report has had praise heaped on it from all over the world but the hon. the Minister does not accept the report at all. He takes the minority view, the minority view in regard to migrant labourers. As I say, this is my great concern.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister knows better than probably anyone else in this House that clause 1 is in fact a highly dangerous clause. He has spoken of the danger of unemployment, the danger of labour unrest. The hon. the Minister knows that as well as most of us do and he must surely appreciate that what he is doing here by excluding such a vast number of people from rights to which they are entitled, is to gamble with the security of South Africa. That is what he is doing, and it is no good the hon. the Minister saying to me that he is going to come with new legislation; that he is going to have a look at this problem because he accepts that something should be done about it. Sir, he is playing with fire when he says that because by the time he can physically do something about it, the damage may well have been done. The bitterness will have been created, the fires will have been stoked and that is the sort of thing that we are trying to avoid.</p>
<p>Before I go any further I want once again to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the following amendments that my party moved in the Other Place, viz.&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(1) On page 2, in line 24, to omit all the words after &#x201C;employer&#x201D; up to and including &#x201C;made;&#x201D; on page 4, in line 27.</li>
<li>(2) On page 4, in lines 42 to 44, to omit the definition of &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D; and to substitute:</li>
</ol>
<block name="quote">&#x201C;&#x2018;unfair labour practice&#x2019; means the dismissal of any employee, or the reduction of any employee&#x2019;s rate of remuneration, or the alteration of an employee&#x2019;s terms or conditions of employment to terms or conditions of employment less favourable to him, or the disadvantageous alteration by an employer of the position of any employee as compared to the positions of other employees employed by such employer, for reasons other than&#x2014;</block>
<ol>
<li>(i) those recognized by law as sufficient to justify summary dismissal; or</li>
<li>(ii) those related to the capability of an employee to perform work of the kind which he was employed by the employer to perform; or</li>
<li>(iii) the reason of redundancy.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to deal with the second amendment, namely &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D;. When one looks at that wording as it appears in this clause, it seems all very well. If it means what I think it means in English &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, for the edification of the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat, I should like to say a few words. As far as I could understand what he was saying&#x2014;I may be wrong &#x2014;he said at the beginning of his speech that he could not enunciate his views better than they were expressed by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. His inference from that would seem to be that the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers should have opposed the Bill. As I understand the procedure in Parliament it is this: That one generally opposes a Bill if it does not improve the existing legal position, when that Bill has the intention of amending an existing law. Nobody in my submission can seriously say that the position of the Blacks and of labour generally in South Africa is not being improved by this Bill. There is a very considerable improvement. We could not possibly vote against the Bill but we are voting against certain clauses, as I understand. I agree that there is a large number of unsatisfactory aspects in the Bill. I think the hon. the Minister has gone a long way to admitting that certain aspects are not satisfactory but that the time at his disposal was too short to come forward with a Bill that would have met the circumstances of the day, and that he intends to amend it from time to time. That was what I understood him to say. Let it be made quite clear that the Official Opposition is in favour of the Bill as a whole but that we have very grave objections to certain clauses of the Bill. [Interjections.] We voted for the Bill at Second Reading and at the Third Reading we shall again vote in favour of it.</p>
<p>I said deliberately that I did not want to say anything that would embarrass the hon. the Minister. What I am saying I am saying to embarrass the hon. Senator Dr. Visser. I submit that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser does not represent the NP policy as we find it reflected in the White Paper. He does not represent it, and I think that is clear from what the hon. the Minister has said. I was not at this stage going to refer to an article that appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> but I think I have got to do so now. The reason why I am totally opposed to the view of the hon. Senator Dr. Visser is because he represents something that is a real danger to South Africa. [Interjections.] I am glad to know there is this division; I am glad to know that hon. Senators on that side of the House agree with me. This article reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Deadlock looms over Black union registration: A show-down is looming between Government and the Black trade union movement which is on the brink of deciding not to register. The Black unions are currently drafting a memorandum to the Minister of Labour setting out their grievances. They are also planning to seek top-level discussion with the Government in an effort to avoid deadlock.</block>
<p>This is very serious. The hon. the Minister himself has said that labour matters are extremely delicate in the political sense and that there can be confrontation between Black and White if something goes wrong, and that none of us seeks. Every responsible person in this country, Black or White, seeks to avoid such confrontation. The attitude that the hon. Senator Visser is adopting&#x2014;and I wish he were here so I could say this to his face but he will have to read the Hansard&#x2014;is a dangerous attitude. I want to refer to his speech in which he said &#x2026;</p>

<p>He is not here but that is unfortunate for him. I would like to get this on record. In his speech he said the following and I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Ons weet wat the gevare van die kommunistiese wêreld is en hoe hulle te werk gaan om ons vakbonde al hoe meer te probeer ondermyn teen ons Blankes en teen ons Regering in Suid-Afrika, en nie alleen teen ons Blankes nie maar ook teen the verantwoordelike Nieblanke. En die verantwoordelike Nieblanke is net so min aanvaarbaar vir the kommunisme as wat &#x2019;n verantwoordelike Blanke vir hulle aanvaarbaar is.</block>
<p>He says this and yet this is the very thing that the attitude that he is adopting wifi bring about. It is cutting the ground from under the feet of the responsible Black worker about whom we have heard so much from the hon. Senator Scheepers. She knows them; she works with them; they are here. They are responsible people. Those are the people whom we must get on our side. And here is an attitude of mind in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s party which absolutely flies in the face of all this desire for co-operation by us on this side of the House, by the majority of hon. Senators on that side of the House and by these Black workers themselves. According to this re port, this is a statement which was apparently made by one of the Black union leaders. Let us hear what he has to say. I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">We understand that the Government is constrained in the rate of progress by its right wing and the fear of a backlash among conservative White workers and voters. But we are also under pressure to deliver the goods. If we who are moderate do not succeed in showing reasonable progress we will be replaced by the more aggressive leaders. That has already been made clear to us.</block>

This expresses the sentiments of these people. That is why the attitude that is adopted by the&#x2014;let me use the modern term &#x2014;verkrampte section of South Africa&#x2014; whether on this side or on that side of the House makes no difference&#x2014;is such a dangerous attitude. That is why this hon. Minister requires all the support he can possibly get and that is why he will get the support from this side of the House. [Interjections.] Of course he is getting the support and we will continue to give him our full support. However, what we say and what we plead for is precisely the opposite of what the hon. Senator Dr. Visser pleads for. We plead that the whole of this movement forward be accelerated. That is what we are pleading for. We say that this is too slow, and by Jove, Sir, every one of us sitting here today knows it is too slow. Time is not on our side. One looks to the north and one looks to the west and one realizes time is not on our side. The hon. the Minister is a convert to the ideas of Professor Wiehahn and that is why he requires from his own side, from that side of the House, all the support that he can possibly get.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I just wish to finish my argument and my discussion in regard to the second part of the amendment. If the hon. the Minister will look at that he will see it deals with the provision in respect of unfair labour practice. If the hon. the Minister will refer to his explanatory memorandum he will see that that term is explained as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">A new definition viz. &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D; has been inserted to deal with future situations where disputes arise between employees and employers who change traditional work practices.</block>
<p>In other words, the term &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D; has in fact been inserted as a new definition to deal with what the explanatory memorandum calls traditional labour practices. This appears at the bottom of page 2 of the explanatory memorandum.</p>
<p>I should very much like to know just what in fact that traditional labour practice is. What is traditional to our labour force here in South Africa? It seems to me that what was traditional labour practice five, ten or fifteen years ago, is certainly not traditional labour practice today. During the past five to ten years approximately 20 000 Blacks have been doing jobs which were previously reserved for Whites on the Railways, and the same applies to the Post Office and many other sectors of our economy. Blacks or non-Whites are today doing work that was traditionally done by Whites in the past. That is a traditional labour practice. It was traditional at that time. It is no longer traditional today. Therefore when the hon. the Minister uses that definition in his explanatory memorandum, I believe it complicates the issue even further. What is &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D; should in fact have nothing to do with the traditional labour practice that he is talking about because that has been changing from year to year. Therefore my amendment seeks to set out what in fact would be unfair labour practices. They are quite the normal ones which one would expect between labour and management and I do believe that this is a far better definition than the one that is contained in the Bill.</p>
<p>I want to leave that particular point at that and return to the argument I was advancing earlier in regard to the question of the border workers or the migrant workers. I want to say to the hon. the Minister as I said earlier that every authority, even his own authority in this booklet <i>Empact</i> which carries a message from him at the beginning of the book, runs contrary to what is contained in the legislation. I want to quote from page 7 of the booklet where it says &#x201C;all employees qualify&#x201D;. I assume that what is contained in this booklet has the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s approval since he has attached a message to it. This deals with the Wiehahn Commission and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Commission concluded that no restrictions or qualifications should be placed on the eligibility for trade union membership of any worker irrespective of whether he was a migrant worker or a commuter. In the interaction between employer and his employees the Commission took the view that what really was of importance was that a person whatever his origin was an employee and that there should be appropriate machinery to deal with employees collectively.</block>
<p>The hon. the Minister must admit that that is not contained in the Bill before us. This is the booklet that dealt with the Wiehahn report. The Wiehahn report makes the same point, and so does the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s memorandum. I do not believe that it is good enough for the hon. the Minister to tell the House and to tell the country that he accepts that it is a problem and that he is going to deal with it, but that he has not had time to handle that particular part of the new machinery for labour regulations at this stage. By putting that restriction here, I believe he is in fact, as I said just now, taking a dangerous course, a course that could so damage labour relations&#x2014;and labour relations and race relations are one and the same thing in South Africa&#x2014;that it would have been best left out altogether. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intentions cannot be followed up in the time available to us, that is in the next few months. The hon. the Minister will have to come with legislation. Is that right? If the hon. the Minister can assure me that he does not have to come with legislation to amend this but that he can do this by proclamation, I would like to know when he intends to do it, how soon he intends to do it, because the longer he delays the more damage is going to be done. Mr. Chairman, this is the prime reason why I cannot accept this legislation. If the hon. the Minister can give me some satisfaction, some reassurance&#x2014;not me, but the people affected&#x2014;on this highly contentious and highly dangerous matter, I would be very pleased.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-labour">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I should now like to try to reduce something which appears to be very complicated and some which has attracted complicated argument to its simplest possible form. What have we before us today? We have before us a Bill which for the first time provides that Blacks may belong to registered trade unions and that they will be recognized. That is, as far as the concept of association is concerned, the kind of step that was asked for to give satisfaction. Since I became Minister of Labour the great dispute in South Africa has always been that according to law the Black man was not a worker. The law now states that he is a worker. It is further provided that if the Black man is a worker he may also organize a trade union. I do not want to argue about the underlying philosophy now because the time factor is unfortunately against us. For the time being, though, I just want to say that I think I have gone a long way by saying that all persons who are organized into a trade union, whoever they may be, must be registered. This refers to newcomers as well, because I want to know what they are doing. I want to see what they are doing and I want to know where their funds come from. I want to know who is organizing the new trade union and whether they are participating in politics. This applies to everyone.</p>
<p>Now the problem we are saddled with is how to ascertain who the newcomers are, i.e. the Blacks according to the definition. One could argue incessantly to formulate a definition of a newcomer, for some of the Black people live across the border in another state, but work in an adjoining state. They live in a certain state and may decide one night that they will go on strike in South Africa the next day. Tonight, however, they are in another state where we cannot reach them and that creates a difficulty for we are then dealing with an international situation.</p>
<p>What is more, tomorrow those persons go on strike in one of our factories&#x2014;I am not saying it will happen but am simply indicating the possibilities&#x2014;and the following day they catch a train back to another state and they then become citizens of that other state. Then they stand outside picketing the factory to keep other workers away. There is a clash and which subsequently gives rise to serious problems. Two countries are now involved in the matter and the Minister of Foreign Affairs is drawn into it.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the Wiehahn commission makes a very interesting point in its report. Hon. Senators should read it. <i>Inter alia</i>, it says that there should be inter-state agreements for certain cases. I am bearing all that in mind. If a person is a worker and he works here I should like to recognize him and I should like him to belong to a body with which we can discuss matters. However, I also want to ensure that the governments of other states and the heads of other organizations and I have been able to hold consultations with one another as to the action we should take in case of a strike. With whom do I lodge a complaint if something like that were to happen? I do not want to mention the names of any states, but hon. Senators will realize where this can lead to.</p>
<p>That is the reason why I have asked hon. Senators to give me a chance to study the host of problematical cases that could arise in an attempt to find a formula that would cover all those cases properly. If we are in too great a hurry and do not examine all the aspects properly we could perhaps decide on a formula which I would not regard as sufficiently watertight.</p>
<p>However, I know what is troubling hon. Senators but I do not think that it is such a very serious problem because I have said this before in the Other Place and elsewhere, and I am saying it now for the third time in this House: Those trade unions that are known to us and whose members live in orderly communities, for example, at Kwa Mashu and many other places&#x2014;I have a long list of such places from the Ciskei as far as Gazankulu, Lebowa, Venda, QwaQwa, Bophuthatswana and Transkei&#x2014;do not present any problem. Six hundred and eight thousand clients work in the various towns in the states I have mentioned; we are now dealing with them and we have to sort them out. I have said in this House before that in my opinion some cases are reasonably straightforward. Therefore, I want to give the assurance once again that I shall not wait until December but that I shall in all probability invite all interested parties in August for the simple reason that I know that they, too, want clarity on the matter. As a matter of fact, the newspapers have already been full of it. It suits me, and not them so much, to consult with these Black trade unions so that we and they may know where we stand. I shall summon the trade unions and say to them: For the time being we can exempt the following people. After that I shall ask my department to assist me in clearing up matters and in that way we shall satisfy a large number of trade unions. There are problematical cases that I shall not have solved by August. I do not know when we shall have sorted those out. In other words, Sir, I require a little more time to deal with problematical cases.</p>
<p>But if I were to tell hon. Senators across the floor of the House today that I shall shortly, early in the recess, go out of my way to grant exemption to a large number of trade unions&#x2014;I am tempted to mention some of them by name but I think that would be unfair&#x2014;would that satisfy them? Does that help hon. Senators?</p>

<p>Very well, then we understand one another. If hon. Senators are satisfied, we need not argue any further. I give them the assurance now that I shall try to clear up this matter as soon as possible. Why? Not because hon. Senators have asked for it, but because I want to establish order as soon as possible and find out where we stand with one another. However, I want to repeat that even if we were to talk until tomorrow morning, there is one thing that I cannot do. I cannot say right out that I shall delete the clause and throw the door so wide open that I shall not be able to close it tomorrow. I do not want to do that. I want an opportunity to look at all the problematical cases. Why do I say that, Sir? Many prominent industrialists who have many of these people in their employ, come and talk to me. I also receive messages from them. Hon. Senators will be surprised to know that I receive messages warning me and asking whether I had thought of certain difficulties that could arise if I were to admit certain people. I refer once again to the case of people who come from across the border to work here. For example over 200 000 come from Mozambique to work in our mines here.</p>

<p>Wait a minute. Who says so? That is precisely the point. The hon. Senator says that is a different matter, but an hon. member in the Other Place suggested that they should be included. Therefore you can see, Mr. Chairman, how we differ among ourselves. I put this question in the Other Place: &#x201C;Do you really mean that people who come from Mozambique to work in the mines for 18 months&#x2014;people who are raw, who have to be trained and who work here at a fixed rate for a fixed period&#x2014;should have trade union rights in our country?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Very well, now hon. Senators agree with me but the arguments advanced in the Other Place gave the impression that they and hon. members there did not belong to the same party. All I want to do is to indicate how difficult it is. Supposing there are workers who come from Mozambique on a regular basis and virtually go home for holidays only. Such a worker may perhaps have been working here for 30 years already; he may even already have become a &#x201C;boss boy&#x201D;. Must I admit him?</p>

<p>I want to give hon. Senators the assurance that I shall act soon and that I shall grant exemptions wherever possible. As far as the straightforward cases are concerned I hope to have done so by August. Another point I want to make is that before this legislation is placed on to the Statute Book and before these people have organized themselves and completed the forms the next session of Parliament will be due. In other words, not all that much time will have elapsed before we take the next step. I appeal to hon. Senators therefore not to press me when I have little time at my disposal within which to draft a formula which I am not sure is the right one. I want time to see whether or not I am right. Because I know there are cases that will be adversely affected, I want to give the assurance that I shall do my utmost to assist them as soon as possible. What could be fairer than that? That, then, is also my reply to the arguments that have been advanced. I shall not act in an irresponsible manner. After all I know that if I am not careful I shall cause difficulty and surely that is not what I want to do. I do not want to commit an unjust act which may lead to eruptions and labour unrest. I want to avoid that. In this connection I want to tell hon. Senators that I will assist the organizations. Before legislation in this connection was tabled in Parliament I had already told thousands of industrialists throughout the country the things that I have just told hon. Senators. I said that six weeks or a month ago when we started to discuss these matters. The department saw these matters as part of its negotiations. So it is nothing new, because industrialists were already aware of these things before hon. Senators knew about them.</p>
<p>The next matter I want to deal with refer to unfair labour practices. An unfair labour practice is not a formulated practice but something which develops gradually. It is a practice which may quite justifiably present a completely different aspect in 20 or 50 years&#x2019; time to what it presents today. We are establishing a labour court which will not only adjudicate on rights like an ordinary court, but also on interests. That is why this new court will not operate according to our usual legal system as is also the case in other parts of the world. At the moment we have a labour tribunal but this tribunal is not so much concerned with rights as with interests such as wages, etc. But the new labour court will be concerned with wages and interests. In future this court will, in the same way as our legal system is undergoing evolutionary changes today, conduct investigations but it will have the benefit of a commission which is able to advise it as to whether or not it will be in the interests of an organization to lay down a formula in due course. If such a situation arises therefore, the Minister must not be asked whether it is a good or bad labour practice. The matter must be submitted to the court which will then investigate the matter in conjunction with the Manpower Commission. Then the court decides what rights the people have and what is in their best interests. I cannot amend this clause, therefore, because I want the labour court itself to have the opportunity in future to draft a formula on what is an unfair labour practice.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to say immediately that the last part of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech impressed me. It makes a good deal of sense. My amendment does not alter that situation that much and therefore I will let it stand. I am not quarrelling with the hon. the Minister too strongly on that point.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this speech the hon. the Minister talked about the difficulties he has with the migrant labourer coming over the border, causing trouble and skipping over the border again. I do not want to be facetious but I can remember that when we have discussed this whole question of Bantustans and borders over the years we have all taken that particular point, viz. that you could make every little incident an international issue. The hon. the Minister has used exactly the same words as I have heard expressed from this side of the House for many years. But I will let that pass because we are dealing with something more important.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister says he will act speedily, and I accept that he will try. I know that things often do not run smoothly and that he may probably not be able to adhere to the time-table he likes, but that will not be his fault. If the hon. the Minister is going to act as speedily as he says in regard to this particular problem of frontier commuters like the Kwa Mashu and Umlazi people in regard to trade unions, will he act against the trade unions in the meantime? This Bill gives the hon. the Minister powers to act against trade unions which have members who should not be members of those unions. I am now referring to the migrant and border area workers. According to the legislation, trade unions will have to root them out.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-labour">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>We will act benevolently towards the commuters but we will have to be very careful as regards the contract workers. The contract workers actually pose a problem to my Department.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>I think the hon. the Minister should make this quite clear so that it is on record. He has said that he is going to act speedily to correct or to find a solution to this particular problem of the commuters. I am talking about the people who live near the big urban areas in places such as Kwa Mashu, Umlazi, near Pretoria and elsewhere. I am not talking about the contract worker who may come from Mozambique, Malawi or somewhere else. Having established this point, I wish to ask the hon. the Minister a further question. In terms of a clause in this Bill with which we will be dealing soon it will be illegal for a trade union to have members who are in fact commuters, for example, people who are residents of Umlazi. This is one of the problems. Having said that, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is going to prosecute these unions who have commuters as members. He cannot solve the one problem without solving the other. I hope the hon. the Minister knows what I mean. This clause gives him very strong powers to act because commuters are not employees in terms of this clause. In terms of a later clause they are not allowed to be members of trade unions.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>
<speech by="#scheepers">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, when I spoke previously I omitted to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his appointment as Leader of the Other Place. I wish him many fruitful years. I can assure the hon. the Minister that I am very pleased that he retained the portfolio of Manpower and Development. Although we have differences of opinion in regard to certain clauses in this Bill, I can assure the hon. the Minister we have never got on better with any other Labour Minister during the reign of this Government, and I hope he will retain this position for many years to come.</p>
<p>We are going to oppose clause 3, and I shall not speak for long as I know the hon. the Minister is anxious to finish this debate this afternoon. We must object most strongly to the racial division in clause 3. This does not improve the position of the workers and, should workers in future decide to have a mixed union registered, numbers should not be taken into account. Although there is an amendment, I do not think it goes far enough. We would like the hon. the Minister to be sympathetic in future in a case where a mixed trade union applies for registration. The people belonging to the trade union will have agreed to it, they will have agreed to that principle and they will have become members under those conditions, and in these circumstances the racial aspect should be completely ignored. I hope that next year this provision will be deleted completely from the Act so that trade unionists will be able to decide for themselves what type of union they want, mixed or otherwise.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-labour">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to tell hon. Senators that I have the formula here. When the numbers are too small, or when relations warrant it, the Minister will use his judgment. And what is a sensible Minister going to do in future? He will get the Manpower commission to go into the matter thoroughly and he will then decide how it is to happen after he has received advice in this connection. He will, within the framework of the Act and its objectives, the policy of his party and the attitude it has adopted, come to the decision which circumstances demand.</p>
<p>I do not want to say anything further about this, Sir, I just want to say that I accept the amendment and I believe that it will be applied with great circumspection in future. As hon. Senators know this is an amendment to a clause in respect of which there can be serious misunderstanding and emotionalism. I am particularly pleased that she has moved it without being too emotional about it because if we seriously disagree with one another, we may be aggravating a conflict situation that may arise in this connection. I content myself with what I have just said, therefore, and I believe that the way in which it will be applied will be of such a nature that we shall be able to maintain peace.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>
<speech by="#scheepers">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in my Second Reading speech I dealt with clause 4 but the hon. the Minister omitted to reply to me. I told him the difficulty we were having in understanding the principle underlying provisional registration. I also told him that we were not opposed to provisional registration. However, I am afraid that people without any following will get registration and that they will go among the workers. In that way a great deal of chaos can be caused. An unhealthy position can arise. I think this is something that should have been gone into far more carefully before allowing people to register before they have any following whatsoever.</p>
<p>These people should not even have the right to go to the Industrial Court to serve on industrial councils. I should like to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to allow only the workers of fully registered trade unions to participate in industrial councils. I believe that all workers should have the right to participate in industrial councils but not those who are provisionally registered.</p>

<p>Good. In that case I have no further worries in that regard.</p>
<p>There is an amendment in respect of the proposed new section 4B, but I do not think it goes far enough. The hon. the Minister has given an undertaking that he will not prosecute unions. In terms of this proposed new section they can be prosecuted and fined R500 for each person who is not eligible for registration. I think the hon. the Minister should act as speedily as possible to grant exemptions, especially to those unions that have that type of person as a member.</p>
<p>I am not going to repeat what I said before, Sir, because I do not want to waste the time of the House. But we are very strongly opposed to the principle embodied in the proposed new section 4B(2).</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-labour">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, we need not argue any further because we shall not agree on this point. I tried a moment ago to explain in detail what we intended to do. Let us leave it at that. As far as the first part of the request of the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers is concerned, I am pleased that she accepts my point of view as I explained it across the floor of the House. She raised two points. The one deals with fines. It does not say that it has to be R500; it could be up to R500&#x2014;it could also be 5 cents. Precisely because there may be ample opportunity for a misunderstanding to arise, we shall be very careful not to fine people, left, right and centre or to act in a negative manner. After all it is not in the interests of either the department or the industry as a whole or the trade unions if we deal with the matter unsympathetically. I want to satisfy the hon. Senator on that score. As far as the technical point of whether R500 is not too high, is concerned, I can only say that it need not be R500&#x2014;it could be far less than R500. I trust the hon. Senator is satisfied with that.</p>
<p>The second point the hon. Senator raised&#x2014;she did not really make an issue of it&#x2014;was that of relationship. That matter has been cleared up by way of an amendment. It has already been discussed in the Other Place and I was satisfied to do it like that. I do not think we need argue that matter any further. Arguments are not going to bring us any further. [Interjections.] Do you really want to argue? Do you really think you can say anything that will influence me?</p>

<speech by="#crook">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. M. CROOK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I refer to the proposed new section 4B(2). The hon. the Minister said at an earlier stage and then repeated it that it was not intended to institute criminal proceedings in accordance with this provision. It is a bad principle to put into any legislation a criminal clause if there is no intention of enforcing it. It brings the law into disrepute. I suggest that the hon. the Minister should do something about that. If there is no intention to proceed in cases where the law is flouted then this provision should be deleted.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-labour">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, it is not a question of having no intention to proceed, but we must be reasonable. I have tried to indicate that in the initial stages there will be occasions when the Minister and the department will have to argue about the implementation of the law. All i am saying now is that at the beginning the department will be lenient. We shall not try to prevail upon or force the trade unions; there will be a stage of explanation.</p>
<p>*After all, Sir, this is surely a delicate matter. Who is going to blunder in and throw people into gaol indiscriminately? Surely nobody governs a country like that. Surely we know that this is a delicate situation. We shall talk to the trade unions; we shall try to sort things out. It will be fine if everything goes well. Let me give an example: If a regulation is made to the effect that people may not travel faster than 100 kilometres per hour, surely one does not fine all those who do right from the start. You warn and you keep on warning until a stage is reached where you have to take firm action. The same principle applies in the case of this legislation. I want to ask hon. Senators to leave it at that and to see how deftly we handle the matter.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way. In any labour situation, when a small group of workers of a different race group wants to join a trade union because their own numbers are too small to enable them to form their own trade union they would, according to law be able to join an existing trade union. It may happen that the actual formula of having too few members does not apply in all cases but that the question of ratio may nevertheless be a factor. The clause provides that in such a case they would be able to join. The hon. Senator now wants to know how it will happen. The Minister will act sensibly if he is confronted with such a situation in future. How will he do it? He will have the position investigated. He will want to know whether it is necessary; what is behind it; who the people are and whether they are qualified to decide and how viable it would be. Then he will say to the Manpower Commission which he has created: Look into the situation for me; negotiate with the people; talk to the other trade unions; find out what the best solution is and come back to me so that I can decide. That is how it will happen. The hon. Senator must not ask me now what will happen in future. We shall act within the framework of this clause. We shall probably act as I have just explained to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I still do not understand what the formula is. The amendment states&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; or that by reason of the ratio between the numbers of employees of the different population groups concerned it would be expedient to form a union in respect of more than one such population group,</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, may I just explain. Let us take a hypothetical case. In respect of the first part of the formula which covers those cases where the numbers are too small, let us take the case of 10 people who want to form a trade union, but 10 are too few for that purpose. Now they want to join a trade union with a membership of 5 000. Obviously it is ridiculous for 10 people to form their own trade union. But there are trade unions with a membership of between 20 and 30. Suppose you have a situation where 50 000 people belong to a trade union. Suppose, then, there is a group of 200 people which in itself is a sufficient number to establish a trade union. In terms of the first formula it would mean that the group would be unable to join because 200 is a sufficient number for the establishment of a trade union. But in terms of the second leg of the formula there would also be a kind of ratio. Although 200 are sufficient <i>per se</i> to form a trade union, 200 in proportion to 50 000 is rather an absurd kind of situation. Does the hon. Senator understand that?</p>

<p>But that is not the kind of matter which the Minister can discuss with you at this stage. Why would the Minister, as far as these things are concerned, create machinery such as an industrial court and a manpower commission to deal with labour practices if he were expected at this stage to spell out what the various future possibilities are? That is why I am satisfied that the formula must remain as it is and that the definition be extended in this way because that makes it somewhat wider than it was. I then leave it in the hands of the people I have appointed to advise me after they had proper consultations on and had gone into the matter. In a debate such as this I do not think hon. Senators can expect the Minister to look too far ahead and to discuss a whole number of probabilities because that does not get us anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not going to argue with the hon. the Minister. I think he agrees with me that this is the job reservation clause. It retains job reservation enactments which at present exist; they are staying there for the time being. This is the way the clause reads. What it is in fact doing is that while section 77 of the Act is being repealed those job reservation provisions which at present are in existence, remain in force until the Minister repeals them.

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I do not want to detain the House. I just want to speak briefly on the question of freedom of association. The recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission, as I pointed out recently, gave a great deal of hope to many people, particularly the Blacks and the trade unions, and also to overseas people. The report received very good publicity and I think the hon. the Minister of Labour will learn from Prof. Wiehahn when he comes back that people overseas are adopting a different attitude, because the people whom I contacted were hopeful that we were now on the right road. We have accepted this Bill because certain principles contained in it are good, but as far as the question of freedom of association is concerned we have objected to the relevant clauses because they are bad.</p>
<p>We believe that integration should not be forced upon people, but where people decide of their own free will to join the same unions there should also be no objection to that. They should have the freedom of choice. Article 2 of the ILO Convention, No. 87 of 1948, which concerns freedom of association and protection of the right to organize, states&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Workers and employers without distinction whatsoever shall have the right to establish and subject only to the rules of organizations concerned, to join an organization of their own choosing without previous authorization.</block>
<p>The Wiehahn Commission&#x2019;s report states&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The recognition of the right of employees to organize for the purpose of collective representation in dealing with employers presupposes that they shall be free to do so without restriction.</block>
<p>These are the principles, Mr. President, that I hope will be embodied in the final Industrial Conciliation Act after all the reports have been submitted to the hon. the Minister and he has had more time to study them. We were sympathetic to some extent today when the hon. the Minister explained his difficulties and particularly when he explained how sympathetically he will treat the cases in regard to exemption.</p>
<p>The commission&#x2019;s report states further&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Allowing only racially segregated unions would be a severe curtailment of freedom of choice. In other words, prohibiting mixed trade unions is wrong, but equally the enforcing of mixed trade unions would infringe the right not to associate.</block>
<p>The commission concluded, just as we do, that the question of membership is something that should be left to the workers to decide for themselves.</p>
<p>The Government has, in my opinion, made a wrong move on this issue of mixed trade unions. Our racial situation is delicate. For that very reason we believe that freedom of association should be permitted as this will develop a steady normalization of trade unions on non-racial lines in this country. I cannot understand how the hon. Senator Dr. Visser, for instance, can be of the opinion that we will be able to retain this separation for ever, or the present <i>status quo</i>, because we can never do it. We can all see what is happening around us and in my opinion we should make the necessary changes, particularly in the labour field, so that we can enjoy a better future than our friends around us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this step by the Government detracts immensely from the positive changes in the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission. If we fail to meet the criteria of the ILO, the world trade union movement, our trade unions and the Blacks will not accept the position. There will always be ill-feeling. I hope that the hon. the Minister will have more time during the recess to consider all these matters and that he will come forward with better legislation next year.</p>
<p>As stated in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, if the present leaders are not successful in co-operating with the Government in an effort to get Black trade unions established, as they have the right to do now, extremists will take over. That is what we must try to prevent at all costs. That is also the reason why I stated during the Second Reading debate that the present registered trade unions could only have a good influence on mixed trade unions and would be able to establish a sound relationship basis in this country, while the moderate forces of multiracialism were being crippled by provisions such as we have in the present Bill. I do not want to go any further, save to say that I hope that next year we will be able to pass a far better Bill.</p>

<p>Because we get one of the most encouraging reports we have ever had on labour, the Wiehahn report, which told them that the world was theirs if only they had the courage to take the necessary action. Then they had the report of the Riekert Commission, another report which has so much positive to say. In other words, these reports did not condemn the Government outright and say that everything it had done over 30 years should be thrown overboard and scrapped. In fact, they were good and positive reports, and the Minister must admit this, because they built on existing legislation. They did not say that everything had to be thrown out but that we should take what we had and build on it. But a certain man called Paulus in the Transvaal mutters a few words and the hon. the Minister says on TV that he only represents about 2% of the work force &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister made some very nice noises. I almost clapped when I saw him on TV making that statement. I thought that we were now going to get somewhere, that we were going to get the legislation and that we would be on the right path. But what happened? We get the printed legislation before us and it is meek and timid and could have been written in a convent. This is really what it amounts to. I am bitterly disappointed that the Government, the hon. the Minister and hon. Senators opposite, did not have the courage to grasp the nettle and to do something about it. But, no; we are going on and we are preserving that bit of job reservation that still exists just in case we hurt a few people and we are going to have trade unions which exclude migrant workers from outside our borders because we may create an international incident if we have problems with them. I really am in despair. We received these two excellent reports, offering us something positive, and the Government does not have the courage to do anything worthwhile about it except to make some cosmetic changes. I am most disappointed with them and will vote against the Third Reading. I do it with reluctance because I really thought my friends opposite were going to show their teeth for a change and really get stuck into this problem.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this legislation. I also want to draw the attention of hon. Senators opposite to the fact that years ago when the Labour Party was in power, the NP always took the labour community in this country into consideration. That is why the National Party is in power today. Hon. Senators opposite who today belong to the same party as the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers have always opposed her principles over the years. We and the kindred spirits of the hon. Senator Scheepers, together, started to form the government of this country. In the &#x2019;twenties we co-operated with the Labour Party in placing much of our labour legislation on the Statute Book. Over the years we have remained in power. The only time when hon. Senators opposite co-operated with the Labour Party was during the war years and then the Labour Party declined under them. When the NP came into power again we governed so well that the Labour Party disappeared completely from the scene. If there is any party that knows how to look after labour matters in this country, then it is the NP. Our colleagues opposite are the representatives of big capital in this country and that is why they are sitting there. We are on the government side because we act in a responsible way towards the labour community. We have had fewer strikes in this country over the past 50 years, thanks to the legislation introduced by the first NP Government, than any other country in the world. We now realize that certain adjustments have to be made to our labour legislation as a result of the new tendencies that have manifested themselves in the social sphere and the field of labour. This legislation is another step forward, but it is a step in the right direction. Ours is not a static party. Ours is a dynamic and developing party but we are not going to extremes like insane people; we go forward step by step as circumstances demand. Circumstances demand that we come forward with this legislation today. We accept it but this is not the final step. The laws of the NP Government are never final. Ours is an evolutionary party and to the extent to which the county develops and to which circumstances demand, we amend the laws and introduce new legislation. We want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this legislation and we trust that we shall have the same labour peace and quiet in the new era we are entering as we had in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I must contain myself so as not to make a long speech so late in the afternoon. I am very grateful that we have got as far as this and there are only two things I should like to say now. Hon. Senators Opposite confront me with the Wiehahn commission report; they tell me that it is a good report and that we should do what it says. To that I just wish to say this: It is a good report, and it was a good commission. I appointed it myself. But I want to add this: The commission does not govern the county, the NP governs the county. That is the first point.</p>
<p>Secondly, if we have to decide, and if I have to decide, then I can choose one of two groups to take along with me. The first is the ILO which is established overseas and the other group consists of the members of the trade unions in my own country&#x2014;my own people. And if I have to choose, I choose my own people. I need say nothing further. That is the point we have reached.</p>

<heading>IN-SERVICE TRAINING BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-labour">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Some time ago the Government, with a view to the better utilization of manpower and as a result of the needs of industry, appointed an interdepartmental committee known as the Naudé Committee. The terms of reference of the committee were to inquire into and report on the training and retraining of Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics in industry, particularly on the level of operators and the higher category of semi-skilled workers. The training of apprentices in terms of the Apprenticeship Act, 1944, was not included in the terms of reference.</p>
<p>One of the recommendations of the committee was that if the industries themselves established training schemes for their White, Coloured or Asiatic workers, the State, just as in the case of the training of Black workers in terms of the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act, 1976, should render financial assistance such as tax concessions in regard to the schemes. This recommendation was accepted by the Government.</p>
<p>A need for training for that part of the labour force that has not had some or other form of artisan&#x2019;s training has been experienced for a considerable time. In 1976 a start was made to fill this need when the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Act was placed on the Statute Book. However, the White and Coloured trade unions alleged that employers, as a result of the implementation of the Act that makes provision for the training of Blacks, are giving preference to the employment of Blacks because employers receive tax concessions on their training expenses and are also able to acquire a better equipped and more productive worker at a low cost. From a training point of view, of course, the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Act only benefits Black workers. If the benefits of the latter are not also made available in regard to the training of Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics, it may be regarded as giving preferential treatment to one population group.</p>
<p>According to the last manpower survey of the Department of Labour of April 1977, 12 665 Whites, 10 738 Coloubeds and 2 274 Asiatics were employed as operators and semi-skilled workers in the building and/or construction industry alone. Consequently there is no doubt that the industrial sector, and possibly the commercial sector as well, could benefit greatly if their non-skilled workers could receive the necessary training to enhance their usefulness, productivity and skill in the work situation. We are all acquainted with the fact that increased production and the better utilization of manpower contributes a great deal to strengthening the economy of a country.</p>
<p>The Bill was drawn up in consultation with organized commerce, industry and the trade unions. Organizations such as the South African Employers&#x2019; Consulting Committee on Labour Matters, Saccola, and trade union federations such as Tucsa and the Confederation of Labour pledged their support for the measure.</p>
<p>On 28 March this year my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance indicated in his budget speech in the Other Place that these concessions would amount to R10 million in a full financial year. Provision for the granting of tax concessions to employers who provide Blacks with training in terms of the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act are already contained in the Income Tax Act. Similar provisions will be made in this year&#x2019;s Income Tax Bill if the Bill which is now before the House is passed.</p>
<p>I now want to explain a few of the important clauses of the Bill to hon. Senators.</p>
<p>Firstly, I want to refer to the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; in clause 1. As I have already mentioned, the purpose of this legislation is to train only Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics on the level of operators and the higher category of semiskilled workers in particular. As you will note, the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; excludes Blacks who are receiving training in terms of the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act from the Application of the Bill because there is existing legislation for them. When the Bill was introduced in the Other Place apprentices and artisans were also excluded. However, after the Bill had been introduced I received urgent representations from employers and trade unions for the inclusion of apprentices and artisans. Therefore I effected an amendment in the Other Place to include these categories of workers so that employers can claim tax concessions on the same basis as that which holds good for Black workers in terms of the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to draw your attention to the definition of &#x201C;training&#x201D;. Employees will be provided with training to make them better equipped for any work in or related to the industry in which they are employed. However, when the Bill was introduced, training provided in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act was also excluded from the Bill.</p>
<p>As far as the latter exclusion is concerned, I also received representations requesting that schemes under the Industrial Conciliation Act should be included. The reason for these schemes initially being excluded was so as not to encroach on the autonomy of industrial councils. Judging from the representations which were received, employers would rather fall under the legislation which is now being discussed so that they may claim tax concessions similar to those which apply to Black workers under the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act. Consequently I effected a suitable amendment in this connection as well.</p>
<p>However, I want to address a timely word of warning to employers who fall under the schemes in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act not to claim double tax concessions if they are now included under this legislation as well. This matter will also be brought to the attention of the hon. the Minister of Finance, so that he may take action if this should be necessary.</p>
<p>Mr. President, clause 2 of the Bill makes provision for the establishment of a Council for In-Service Training and clause 3 for the constitution of the council. The council will consist of 13 members. Two officers of whom one will be the chairman and one the vice-chairman will represent the Department of Labour, and one officer will represent the Department of Inland Revenue. In addition, five persons will represent the interests of employers and five persons the interests of employees. Alternate members may also be appointed. The period of service and remuneration of the members of the council are also being stipulated in this clause.</p>
<p>The procedures to be adopted when meetings of the council are held, for example the voting procedure, are set out in clause 4 of the Bill.</p>
<p>Clause 5 makes provision for the powers and functions of the council and committees that may be appointed by the council. The council will advise me as Minister of Labour on matters of policy, the promulgation of regulations and any other matter relating to the training of employees in terms of this Bill.</p>
<p>In clause 7 provision is being made for the registration of training schemes and the conditions which may be imposed on registration by the registrar. If the registrar should refuse to establish a scheme, the employer in question may appeal to me as Minister of Labour against such refusal.</p>
<p>Clause 8 deals with the registration of private centres for training. The clause also contains a prohibition on the training of employees of one person by another person except at private centres registered by the registrar. Furthermore, the clause provides that the registrar, after consultation with the council, may impose conditions on the registration of a private centre, may grant assistance&#x2014;except financial assistance&#x2014;to such a centre and may, after consultation with the council, withdraw the registration of such a centre. If the registrar should refuse to register a private centre, an appeal may be lodged with me as Minister of Labour.</p>
<p>I now come to clause 11. This clause empowers me as Minister to grant exemption from the provisions of clause 8(1) of the Bill. This means that exemption may be granted, that the employees of another person may be provided with training and that training need not necessarily be provided at a registered training centre.</p>
<p>The other clauses, which I have not specifically elucidated, deal with the administration of the Act. They are clause 6, relating to the appointment of the Registrar and Assistant Registrar of Training Schemes; clauses 9 and 10, which contain provisions relating to the appointment of inspectors and their powers; clause 12, relating to secrecy; clause 13, in terms of which regulations may be made; and clause 14, which contains the penal provisions.</p>
<p>As I have already mentioned, a Black Employees&#x2019; In-service Training Act already exists. If the recommendations of the Riekert Commission on this Act are accepted by the Government, recommendations which amount to the administration of the Act being transferred to the Department of Labour, thought will have to be given to the consolidation of the legislation with the existing Act, and problems which are already being experienced in the application of the existing Act and any further problems which may arise from this legislation, will be taken into consideration at such a consolidation.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the Bill constitutes great benefits for all, i.e. for employers as well as for those employees who ought to receive further training. I trust that it will receive the support of this hon. House.</p>
<p>As this is such wonderful legislation, I trust that we can dispose of it without discussion.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#scheepers">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister was right in saying that this is good legislation. Employers and trade unions have been looking forward to it for many years. When the legislation in connection with the training of Blacks was passed, Coloured and White workers felt that they had been cheated because no tax exemptions were granted in respect of their training. Consequently employers were reluctant and problems arose. Therefore we are very pleased that this legislation has been introduced. I had serious objections because it would not have been possible to train artisans or skilled workers but because the Bill was amended in the Other Place, my objections have fallen away. As we all know there is a serious shortage of skilled workers during the present recession. Our country is very rich in many respects, with the exception of oil. We have a large labour force but we have to use that force to the fullest extent. If we do not train our workers, we shall fall behind and that is why I think that all our workers should be trained, irrespective of race or colour.</p>
<p>As far as training is concerned, our experience has been that workers usually preferred to be trained in that direction in which they would be able to find employment. The clothing industry in the Transvaal had a training college and there we found that the majority of the managerial staff were Whites, and there were also a few Indians.</p>
<p>However, I want to refer to something which the hon. the Minister should definitely pay attention. It happens sometimes that in an area where training should be provided the number of people belonging to one specific racial group are insufficient to justify the establishment of the necessary training facilities because the services of a properly qualified person at a high salary are required to provide that training. I agree with the recommendation of the Riekert Commission that the two acts should be amalgamated and that both should fall under the Department of Labour. I think the hon. the Minister will remember that I have on previous occasions expressed the opinion that labour matters should fall under the Department of Labour and not under various departments because various races are involved.</p>
<p>Mr. President, if we want to make the fullest use of our labour force&#x2014;and that is absolutely essential&#x2014;we shall have to spend a great deal of money on training. The hon. the Minister mentioned a figure of R10 million, but if we were to spend R10 million or even more on the proper training of our labour force it would be one of the wisest investments we ever made. We shall be reimbursed many times over in the form of higher taxation to be paid by both the employers because of increased profits and the employees who will earn higher wages because of their increased proficiency.</p>
<p>We definitely support the principle contained in this legislation, and I trust the hon. the Minister will tell us in his reply whether he intends to consider the amalgamation of the two acts during the recess. When industrial organizations establish training centres, I believe that they should be allowed to train all the workers they require. Some industries may perhaps need more workers from a specific race group, for example, industrial organizations in the Cape Province would perhaps train more Coloureds, but where neither White nor Coloured labour is available, they will also have to train Black labour. I think these matters should be gone into thoroughly because there should be no stumbling blocks as far as training is concerned, for example because a certain group is too small to justify their being trained. Workers work together in the same industries, on the same floor, they operate the same machinery and they accept that. As long as the rate for the job is paid and the responsibility is the same, there are usually very few complaints. I believe, therefore, that the hon. the Minister should consider that matter very carefully.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I trust that we will train enough people to enable us to increase our productivity considerably because hitherto it has been very low. It has only been during the past few years that attention has been given to the training of workers. Whatever the nature of the work to be done, whether it be at the professional or ordinary labour level, or operational or managerial level, people have to be trained for it, and only then will they produce the best results. The National Productivity Institute has found that it is of the utmost importance that those in managerial positions should be properly trained. Usually there are inadequate facilities at training centres to train a sufficient number of workers for all the industries and that is why I think that workers should be trained in a specific industry and after that there should be in-service training, thus enabling those workers to teach other workers the skills they have acquired.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I would just like to have certainty as regard the amalgamation of the two Acts and the manner in which training will take place. However, we approve of the principle and we support this legislation.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. J. JOUBERT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want to make a few brief remarks. This legislation deals with the creation of machinery whereby in-service training will function properly, and it also aimed at exercising the necessary control. <i>Inter alia</i>, it provides for the establishment of the council, to which the hon. the Minister has referred, a registrar, as well as inspectors to exercise the necessary control. Therefore the Bill envisages a smooth and effective system of in-service training.</p>
<p>Mr. President, just a few ideas on the value of training. The previous speaker has already elaborated on that. It will be difficult to overestimate the value of train ing and in-service training. We know that increased salaries are continually being paid to meet the increased cost of living and so on. One of the great problems of our day is inflation and that is aggravated if higher salaries are paid without there being increased productivity. And increased production can in turn to a large extent be obtained by better training.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure for me to support this legislation on behalf of this side of the House.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Mr. President, as it is my privilege to introduce the first Bill under your presidency, allow me to congratulate you most heartily on your appointment to this particularly high office. I am sure you will maintain authority in this Upper House with great distinction and I trust that your term of office will be long and fruitful.</p>
<p>Venda&#x2019;s becoming independent will have certain consequences as far as the application of the Unemployment Insurance Act is concerned. The position will be as follows&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(1) The Act will no longer be applicable in Venda from the date on which Venda becomes independent.</li>
<li>(2) Employers who fall under the definition of &#x201C;employer&#x201D; in section 4 will be excluded, and their and their employees&#x2019; liability to be contributors will cease.</li>
<li>(3) In terms of section 41(1)(h) of the Act persons who are outside the Republic are not entitled to receive benefits, and from the date on which Venda becomes independent, no payment of benefits there will be possible.</li>
<li>(4) Employees who are recruited on contract in Venda for service in the Republic and who have to return to their country on termination of their service will, as in the case of citizens of all foreign countries, be excluded from the definition of &#x201C;contributor&#x201D; in terms of section 2(2)(a).</li>
<li>(5) Inhabitants of Venda who do not render a service under contract in the Republic and who do not have to be repatriated upon termination of their service, will be contributors unless they are otherwise excluded from the definition of &#x201C;contributor&#x201D;, just as in the case of all persons in the Republic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mr. President, the question which arose was what obligation there should be towards contributors who are resident in Venda in respect of ordinary unemployment benefits, maternity benefits and illness allowances when Venda becomes independent, and what steps ought to be taken. As hon. Senators know, benefits from an unemployment insurance fund serve as a temporary source of income to assist the worker until he can find work again. With a view to a gradual transition stage the Government felt that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained for a period in order to prevent disruption and dissatisfaction in respect of workers who have been contributors and have built up credits prior to the date of independence. During the transitional period the Venda Government can then de cide what its own wishes are in connection with the establishment of an unemployment insurance fund for its territory.</p>
<p>Certain proposals on the application of the Unemployment Insurance Act after the date of independence were submitted last year to the working committee which was appointed to undertake the necessary preparatory work on the coming independence of Venda. These proposals were accepted by the Venda Cabinet. The proposals are embodied in the Bill which is now before this House.</p>
<p>This legislation is simply consequential legislation as a result of them becoming independent of Venda. It follows precisely the same pattern of the two Bills that were introduced here in the case of Bophuthatswana and Transkei and that were adopted unanimously. This legislation is agreed legislation between the South African Government and the Government of Venda which is shortly to receive its independence.</p>

<heading>LAWS ON PLURAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT SECOND AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#deputy-minister-of-plural-relations">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLURAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want on this occasion to wish you God&#x2019;s richest blessings in the task that has fallen to you. I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>This Bill deals with a large variety of matters of which I shall mention only the most important here.</p>
<p>In clause 2 the powers of commissioners are extended to enable them to enforce their authority and the dignity of their courts irrespective of the race or colour of the transgressor.</p>
<p>Clause 3 provides for the fines which are recovered to accrue to the institution charged with the implementation of the provisions concerned. This clause is linked to clauses 4 and 9.</p>
<p>The new scales which are decreed under clause 10 are based on existing income tax tables applicable to married persons with a family of three children. The average married income tax payer has 1,7 children. While the annual tax of R2,50 was abolished in 1978, this is another step towards achieving the Government&#x2019;s aim of eliminating any disparity in taxes payable by people of different population groups.</p>
<p>The Black States are already recovering considerable amounts in general sales tax in their territories on behalf of the Government. As the taxes are being paid almost exclusively by Blacks, it is right that this money should accrue to the Governments of the Black people concerned.</p>
<p>The amendments in clauses 13, 14 and 15 have become necessary to give meaning and content to the granting of functions to community councils. The provisions contained in clause 16 have become necessary because it has appeared that regulations promulgated for all the community councils in the area of a particular Administration Board create problems in the case of new boards established after the date of promulgation of the regulations. The amendment ensures the stability of bodies which were established in a proper manner.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, it is my pleasant duty this afternoon to wish you well in the new position to which you have acceded today, to repeat what my Leader said in the formal proceedings which preceded these proceedings this afternoon and to say that we will promise you on this side of the House our fullest co-operation in carrying out what sometimes can be a most onerous duty. We wish you well and we congratulate you on your promotion to this high post.</p>
<p>I come now to the legislation before us and I must hasten to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister how much we appreciate the comprehensive explanatory memorandum that we received from his Department. This will, of course, facilitate this debate and will make the passage of this Bill through this House a lot smoother.</p>
<p>I must say that we have here a Bill which is rather like the curate&#x2019;s egg because it is good in parts and very bad in a particular part. We have had to consider our attitude towards the Bill at this Second Reading stage where we should be considering the principle embodied in it. But there is, as you know, Sir, no one principle embodied in this Bill. When we have this sort of situation it makes it a lot more difficult for an Opposition to decide precisely what attitude it should adopt at Second Reading.</p>
<p>We find in the Bill provisions which will improve the standard of life in Soweto. We also find concessions that are made to Africans regarding the amount of income tax that they should pay. We find an extension of the powers of community councils. Regarding these, I wish to pause for a moment and to say that there are certain anomalies which appear when one reads clauses 13, 15 and 16 of the Bill. In fact, there are even contradictions. It is all very well in clause 13 for the hon. the Minister to say that the community council is precluded from making regulations and yet he ties his hands by providing that he is compelled to publish regulations at the request of a community council. I can only say to him: &#x201C;A rose by any other name &#x2026;&#x201D; because community councils are in fact being given that power. The hon. the Deputy Minister is shaking his head. I am not fighting with him; I welcome that fact. If he had come with a Bill which had said that he would not be compelled to accept their ruling then I would have been fighting with him. But this afternoon I am agreeing with him and I am congratulating him for it.</p>
<p>There is also something of importance in the last clause of the Bill, namely the change in the name of the department. Speaking personally, the Department of Plural Relations and Development never meant anything to me. I find that among Africans themselves it meant nothing. But many hurtful jokes have been made in a play on that name and on the intention behind the name. I sincerely hope that the Department of Co-operation and Development is now going to rid itself of that stigma that attached to the name of the Department of Plural Relations and Development and that from now on we can get around to true co-operation with and the true development of the Black people of our country.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, having spoken of the good parts of this Bill, I come to clause 5 which really embodies no principle because the principle of an offence, viz. employing somebody contrary to the influx control regulations, is already embodied in the Act. But we have the situation where we have a massive increase in the penalty to be applied to anybody who may be convicted of the offence of employing or harbouring or keeping an African within an urban area without the necessary permission. Only two short years ago, i.e. 1977, we doubled the fine from R50 to R100, and today we are being asked not to double or to redouble but in fact to increase this fine from R100 to R500. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister with tears in my eyes why the Government always adopts this attitude? Why have they not tried to encourage employers to register their employees, to get the co-operation of employers instead of wielding the big stick? That is what we are being asked to do here this afternoon and, as I have said, this has made it difficult for us to decide how to deal with this Bill at the Second Reading. But having weighed the Bill up, we believe that it contains so many advantages for the African people in this country that we will support the Second Reading of this Bill. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will consider our amendments at the Committee Stage, particularly the amendment we shall move to negative clause 5 of the Bill.</p>
<p>With those few words I tender our support for this measure.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#berg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, in the first place I should like to congratulate you most heartily from the floor of the House. This has already been done by the Leader of the House and it has also been done by the other side. I should like to congratulate you most sincerely on your election to this very high office of President of the Senate. In terms of the Constitution you are not only President of the Senate but you will also act as State President. We should like to congratulate you and Mrs. Kruger and we wish you a very fruitful term of office.</p>
<p>The Bill before the House is an amending Bill; in other words, it is not a Bill with a definite theme or a definite principle. It is a Bill which amends or repeals certain laws. Laws which have become superfluous are repealed and others are amended. As the respective amendments relating to various laws streamline the administration of a very, very complicated portfolio, it is a great pleasure for us to support this amending Bill. The Bill amends certain laws in respect of which it has been found over the years that there are shortcomings that must be rectified. The Bill now before this hon. House does this, and we on this side have pleasure in supporting the amendments that are proposed here.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Mr. President, I should like to say that in view of what we have learnt during the past week, this is probably the last occasion on which the hon. the Deputy Minister will be appearing here. It is my privilege to say here today that I have known him for many years, and I should like to express our deepest appreciation to him on this occasion for the manner in which he has dealt with legislation in this hon. House. We have the highest regard for it. We do not know what his future position will be but it is our wish that just as he has always dealt with legislation in such a precise fashion in this Upper House so he will carry out his future tasks with great dedication and great application in the service of South Africa. We wish him everything of the best. Mr. President, we have pleasure in supporting the measure before the Upper House.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat in regard to the last remarks he passed regarding the departure of this hon. Deputy Minister. As he said, there have been a number of changes in the past few weeks in this Parliament. Of course, the big change we are looking for is that all the Ministers should go; perhaps we shall be fortunate enough to see that one day. But we are thankful for small mercies when they go one at a time and are replaced. But despite that, Mr. President, I wish the hon. the Deputy Minister everything of the best in whatever he is going to do. I am not quite certain what it is, but I hope that he has a fruitful and happy career there.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that he should take his leave of the Senate with a Bill of this nature. My friend, the hon. Senator Webber, in referring to a particular clause of the Bill said it brought tears to his eyes but that he would vote for the good parts of the Bill at the Second Reading. I am afraid, Mr. President, that the tears it has brought to my eyes compel me to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill regardless of the good that it does contain. There is no question that it does contain a fair amount of good&#x2014;or a great amount of good, depending on where one is sitting&#x2014;but the major drawback to me is so important that I cannot lend myself to record support for this legislation. I refer to the point already mentioned by the hon. Senator Webber, viz. the drawback contained in clause 5.</p>
<p>I shall deal with that clause in a little more detail at the Committee Stage because, as has already been said, this is really a Committee Stage Bill and it is not a matter of a particular principle. I want to stress very strongly that the only way to record my objection to the legislation because of this obnoxious clause, despite all the good the Bill otherwise contains, is to vote against the Second Reading.</p>

<p>And after 55 years today is the last day on which there will be a Vosloo in this Parliament. We have all been related to the same family.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, I want to say a few words as far as this debate is concerned. I can assure the hon. Senators Webber and Winchester that it is not an easy thing to do to increase the severity of a law. That is the last thing that I want to do. As far as the administration of Black people in White South Africa is concerned we would be only too pleased if it were unnecessary for us to have inspectors to check on the position. Unfortunately, employers do not observe the law. The fines were increased in 1977. They were not increased to get at the employers but in order to protect the Black man. I want to ask hon. Senators whether they think it is fair towards the Black man who is registered to be employed in a certain area to force him to compete with a Black man who is in that area illegally? Is it fair on the part of an employer to employ somebody on a loose footing without providing him with housing and without paying any levy for the benefit of the whole community? I just want to quote one short paragraph from the Riekert Commission&#x2019;s report to show how unscrupulous some employers are. I read from page 166 where influx control is dealt with. I quote paragraph 4/199&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">These persons are on the whole not deterred by the possibility of clashing with the law or being sentenced to a fine or imprisonment. Employers are prepared to run the risk and are not deterred by the way in which the penalty provisions for unlawful employment are now applied. According to witnesses, some contractors even make provision in their tender prices for the payment of fines in the case of prosecution and save themselves the trouble of clarifying the position of Black workers with the labour bureau. This group of unlawful workers is not always properly housed and gives rise to various social problems, as also set out in paragraphs &#x2026;</block>
<p>*Mr. President, we do not want to play policemen, but this is for the sake of good order and also in the interests of the welfare of the Black people. The employers of those people who are illegally employed pay no levies; they do not contribute to the administration and the upliftment of the Black communities.</p>
<p>The other important factor is unlawful influx. Those people compete on the labour market with people who are already legally resident in White areas. The fine was increased in 1977 and at the end of 1977 the former Minister of Justice in collaboration with the then Minister of Bantu Administration and Development even went so far as to issue a circular in which it was stated that an admission of guilt would no longer be accepted. Thereafter each employer had to appear personally in court. This simply shows how much in earnest we are to establish an orderly process. I am sorry that hon. Senators are now shedding tears about this. I trust that my road ahead will not include tears as well.</p>

<p>Question declared agreed to.</p>

</speech>
<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>
<p>Clause 5:</p>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 5 is the one clause in this Bill that we consider to be absolute anathema. As I said during the Second Reading debate on this Bill, we shall oppose this clause and vote against it. We believe it is totally unnecessary. The fine which is provided for at the moment of a maximum of R100, is, I believe, an adequate deterrent to the employers of South Africa. I do not believe that fines of R100 have in fact been imposed by a court. I do not believe there have been any instances where an employer has been fined R100 per employee for employing persons who have not been registered. Therefore I do not believe it is necessary to increase the fine and I also believe that this is a wrong tactic that the Government is employing.</p>
<p>During the debate on the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development we on this side of the House appealed to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s colleague, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Plural Relations, to consider applying a moratorium on all employers who have employees who have proved themselves to be responsible, employees who have housing and who have all the necessary qualifications except the one qualification of registration with the board. We believed that in this way we would obtain the co-operation of thousands of employers throughout the country, and I mean thousands because I believe that there are thousands because I believe that there are thousands who are employing Africans at this stage &#x201C;illegally&#x201D; simply because of the provisions of the Act. Not for one moment am I pleading for the scrapping of the influx control regulations. However, we have the situation today where it happens repeatedly, particularly in Natal, where an employer has a Black employee and after he has proved his worth &#x2026; Let us start at the beginning, Sir. The reason why that employer has an illegal Black employee is not because he does not want to register him. There are those whom the hon. the Deputy Minister spoke about. I agree with him and if he were to thump those by R100 per employee &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, Sir, I am not discussing the principle. That is why I say I am not objecting at all to influx control regulations. It is their application which will result in this fine of R500 that I want to deal with. I believe that the time has come when the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department should administratively allow these people to register. Many of those are employed illegally because there were no suitably qualified or able Black people available at the time when those employers needed an employee. What happens, however, when the time comes when the employer says to the employee: &#x201C;Look, I must register you. Before I get fined R500 for having you here as an illegal employee I must take you to the office and have you registered&#x201D;? That employee leaves overnight, and the next morning the employer finds himself with no labour because that employee knows that he will not be registered. They will not allow him to register. The employer then again has the situation where he has to find a new employee. Invariably he finds that he has to look for him in the &#x201C;black market&#x201D; because he cannot find one through the legitimate market as a result of the zoning and all the other things which I cannot discuss under this clause. I want to agree with the hon. the Minister that there is an evasion of the levies. There is the question of housing. The last thing that we on this side of the House want is the total scrapping of the influx control laws.</p>
<p>We also had a commission and we also heard from the urban Black people that they want to maintain their own position. They want to keep out this influx of unregistered &#x201C;illegal&#x201D; people who come into the urban areas &#x201C;illegally&#x201D;. I believe that this is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to get the Co-operation by means of a moratorium of those employers who are responsible. Where there is a willing employer with a willing employee and where the employee has proved to be responsible, I believe that the Government should grant that moratorium. Mr. Chairman, we will vote against this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry the hon. Senator Webber has adopted this attitude in regard to clause 5<i>.</i> We had an unwritten agreement that there is really no principle involved in this Bill. Clause 5 provides that the fine that can be imposed be raised from R100 to R500. The hon. Senator is now objecting to this. Mr. Chairman, we must maintain discipline in this country. I fully support the provision as it now appears in the amending Bill. I want to ask whether the hon. Senator has read the White Paper in regard to clause 5. I quote&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It has been found that the existing penalty is inadequate to act as a deterrent and the fine is accordingly increased.</block>
<p>It is now being increased from R100 to R500. We must have discipline in this country. I want to appeal to the hon. Senator Webber to withdraw his objection so that this amendment can go through as it stands. I think it is to the advantage of both colour groups that we maintain this discipline. I want to ask the hon. Senator to retract his arguments and accept the amendment as it stands here. We have pleasure in supporting this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to take this discussion any further in regard to this particular matter. However, what I am saying to the hon. the Minister is where he is now making the amount R500, for instance, is he aware of the difficulties that the amount that is already there causes the employer of labour? The hon. the Minister says the increase is to protect the legitimate worker or the workers who are in the cities legally, and that it is not directed against the illegal worker. This is the purpose of the increase from R100 to R500.</p>
<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I do not believe that it is a protection at all. If one talks to the average employer of labour in this regard one finds that he has great difficulty in obtaining legal workers, the workers who are entitled to be there in terms of the Act. He already has difficulty in obtaining such a worker. He therefore employs somebody whom he then attempts to register and finds that the red tape attached to the registration of that worker &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, Sir. The point is that by increasing the amount from R100 to R500 the hon. the Minister is not going to achieve his objective. In fact, he is going to make it far more difficult than it already is. This is already a difficult section of the Act to administer, but I am not going to deal with that at all. I am saying that increasing the fine from R100 to R500 will not prevent the illegalities that take place under the Act at all because these difficulties are not going to disappear but will remain for other reasons. That is why I say, Mr. Chairman, that in no way could I ever support an increase of this nature. It will not work; it will not in fact achieve what the hon. the Deputy Minister is trying to achieve, and for that reason I must vote against it.</p>

<p>Yes, at the moment, but in terms of this clause it is now being increased to R500. I know of only one case where the maximum fine of R500 was imposed. There are also cases where the courts have considerable jurisdiction in cases where people did not have prior knowledge of the provision or did not try to find out. But this is principally aimed at people who deliberately employ these persons. I accept that the hon.

<p>Clause 10:</p>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the explanatory memorandum tells us in regard to clause 10 that the new tax tables that have been introduced for Blacks have been brought closely into line with the rates of taxation that would be applied to a taxpayer of another race group who is married with three children. Let me say right away that we will not vote against this clause because of the improvement that has been made in the tax scales. Employees who receive the lowest emoluments will now no longer be taxed. The ceiling has been lifted from R600 to R1 200 and we welcome that. But, Sir, when we consider another measure that is before this House, and we consider the recommendations of the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;and I am glad he is here to hear this&#x2014;regarding the taxation of Whites, Coloureds and Asians, then we find that the minimum taxation for a married person with three children is applicable to a person with an income of R5 000 per annum. That person will have to pay an amount of R86 in taxation. With the primary abatement, abatements for three children and allowing an amount of R400 in abatements for pension, medical aid, retirement annuity and insurances, that person would earn a taxable amount of R1 200 on which he would pay R86. A Black person earning R1 200 per annum would be required to pay R12 tax. That is on an income of R1 200 and I would suggest that the difference between R1 200 and R5 000 is such &#x2026; [Interjections.] I will sit down and give the hon. the Deputy Minister a chance to reply, Sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the problem here is a question of phasing. First of all, Black taxation was abolished, and we are now trying to achieve a gradual equalization. There is still not parity. In this case, single Blacks pay far less than single Whites. But it is a gradual phasing and a further step will be taken so that disparity can be removed. This is not yet the final step.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to refer to page 10, subsection (3) of clause 10. [Interjections.] I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister has to leave and I understand that he wishes to take his leave of us now. We on this side of the House wish him well in his new appointment, wherever it may be, in the service of his country. Our thoughts will certainly go with him.</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Thank you. As the hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out, there is provision in this particular subsection that there will be no refund of the amount of tax which has been paid by Africans for the months of March and April and up to such time as the new tax tables are brought into effect. In this regard I want to point out two anomalies and I am glad that the hon. the Minister of Finance is here because I think he is involved in it as well. The hon. the Minister of Finance announced these changes in his budget speech three months ago. We now have the position that Parliament is only now, three months later, validating the announcements he made then. I wonder whether he should not look at the position so that we do not have this situation. The hon. the Deputy Minister has explained the practical problems with regard to the refunding of small amounts of tax to 3 million taxpayers. However, Parliament is now being asked to say that notwithstanding the fact that the hon. the Minister of Finance announced a reduction in the taxation rate in his budget at the end of March, here at the end of May those persons who have paid at the higher rates, the rates which were applied during the past tax year, are not to get a refund of the tax that they have overpaid. I put it to the hon. the Minister of Finance that this is not fair and I hope that he can look into this matter and find another way of doing it. With regard to Whites, Coloureds and Asians on the PAYE scales this gets adjusted at the end of the year when there is an assessment, but regarding the Blacks it does not happen. For that reason I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">(1) On page 10, in line 7, to omit &#x201C;not&#x201D;;</block>
<p>In other words, this amendment will entitle people to a refund of the amount recovered. I know that the hon. the Deputy Minister has practical problems in this matter but it will be up to the taxpayer to make his claim and to produce the proof that he has paid. Once he makes his claim and he produces the proof of his claim I believe one takes away the problems that arise out of this.</p>
<p>There is also a further matter regarding this particular clause. In subsection (2) it is provided that the provisions of subsection (1) shall be deemed to have come into operation on 1 March 1979. In subsection (3) we put right the anomaly of the overtaxation which has been paid by so many people. But the amount referred to there is only for March and April. I know that it was the intention that the new scales should be out for employers by May. But from my own experience and that of my son in Natal I know that people did not have the new tables for May, so that in fact these people have been charged at the higher rate for March, April and May. I submit that to put this right, it is essential that we should amend the Bill accordingly. Whether we accept that there shall be a refund or that there shall not be a refund I think that technically and legally the situation is such that we have to include May as well. For that reason I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">(2) on page 10, in line 9, to omit &#x201C;and April&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;, April and May&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment that we were unable to persuade the hon. the Deputy Minister to reject clause 5 and to retain the penalty at R100 as we had asked him to do.</p>
<p>I have already expressed my congratulations and good wishes to the hon. Deputy Minister Vosloo on his departure from this Parliament and I wish to make only one point regarding the effect this Bill is going to have. Much good is going to flow from it, for example, the people of Soweto and their lights and the new powers that are being given to community councils. All those things are advantageous. Particularly in this time of economic pressure these people are going to welcome the reduction in the taxation. However, there is one thing that does concern me and which I hope the Minister responsible for this department and his officials will look into.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous incidence of bribery within the department, particularly regarding the registration of Africans. Experience has shown that the amount of the bribe is commensurate with the fine which is applied in the case of a conviction. I sincerely hope that this is not going to happen in this case because at the moment it is not only employers but the Blacks themselves who face the problem of bribery. The system of vulumlomo is a system which is applied by many Africans in authority and, I am sorry to say, by many Whites as well. This is the situation we face and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will, administratively through his department, keep an eye open for this to see that it does not happen in this case, viz. that we do not have an escalation not only of the incidence of bribes but also in the amount of the bribe that is demanded. Notwithstanding what I have just said, we will support the Third Reading of the Bill.</p>

I want to say that as I stated in my Second Reading mini-speech&#x2014;I deliberately kept it short because I knew the hon. the Deputy Minister who was handling the Bill had to leave and was in a hurry&#x2014;I took the opportunity of calling for a division on the Second Reading to express in the best way I could my objection to this legislation.

<p>Mr. President, it is a particular privilege for me to be appearing here in this hon. House today on a day which is a special day for you. I am sure that you have the background, both intellectually and academically, to make a great success of this post, and I want to wish you a very pleasant term of office in this capacity.</p>
<p>I should just like to say, Mr. President, that you appeared in the Other Place under my Speakership, and I hope that you treat me better here than I treated you there!</p>
<p>Mr. President, section 55 of our present Constitution and of its predecessor, the old South Africa Act, 1909, has often been the subject of widely divergent opinions concerning disqualification for membership of the Senate or Parliament. As a result of this Select Committees were appointed during the first session of Parliament last year as well as during the present session with the instruction to inquire into and report upon section 55(d) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961 (Act No. 32 of 1961).</p>
<p>I want to express my appreciation to the members of these Select Committees today, not only for the seriousness and dedication with which they viewed their task but also for the fearless objectivity they displayed.</p>
<p>As a result of the fact that I have come to this House today with a Bill which differs from the Bill proposed by the Select Committee, I want to give the assurance that the Select Committee&#x2019;s work has not been in vain. Owing to lack of time the committee&#x2019;s decisions and recommendations can neither be studied nor put into operation at this stage. The Joint Select Committee on the Constitution which is investigating a new constitution for the Republic, will indeed, however, take thorough cognizance of the Select Committee&#x2019;s decisions and recommendations. The Bill before the House at present must consequently be regarded as merely another interim measure since time has unfortunately caught up with us.</p>
<p>In terms of section 55(d) as it stands at present, any person who occupies an office of profit under the Republic is disqualified from being elected or nominated or sitting as a member of the Senate or the House of Assembly. However, a proviso has been added to section 55(d) in terms of which certain persons are not deemed to occupy offices of profit under the Republic. However, in view of the wording of section 55(d) doubt exists as to whether a member of a commission of inquiry appointed by the State President or the Administrator of a province falls under this qualification too. For that reason clause 1 of this Bill proposes that members of such commissions of inquiry be mentioned expressly under the qualification as well. It has also been deemed advisable to include members of Select Committees of the Senate and of the House of Assembly in the proviso in order to eliminate any uncertainty with regard to the members of Select Committees that may sit as commissions during a recess.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the Offices of Profit under the Republic Amendment Act, 1978, was merely an interim measure and lost its protective effect on 31 May 1979. This means that serving members of the Senate or of the House of Assembly or of a provincial council to whom that Act relates, no longer enjoy protection since 31 May 1979. Clause 2 is phrased in such a way that a moratorium of 30 days is afforded those members to rid themselves of any disqualification that may still be attaching to them in terms of section 55(d). The onus rests on the members themselves to determine whether the provisions of section 55(d) still apply to them since 30 June 1979.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the position of members of the various control boards instituted in terms of the provisions of the Marketing Act, 1968 (Act 59 of 1968), and members of the Board of Curators for National Parks appointed in terms of the National Parks Act, 1976, was discussed in depth with the Chief State Law Adviser, and I want to state here emphatically that members of such control boards, for example the Oilseeds Control Board, the Milk Board, the Wool Board, the Maize Board etc. as well as members of the Board of Curators for National Parks are employed by the board in question and are not in the employ of the Republic. Consequently they do not occupy offices of profit under the Republic and so the provisions of section 55(d) of the Constitution are not applicable to them.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I also want to reiterate what I announced in the Other Place with the permission of my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, namely that he has decided to increase the daily allowance of R15 per day payable in terms of Government Notice No. 2192 of 23 November 1973 to a member of a board, committee or similar body appointed by or in terms of any law within the meaning of section 55(d)(vi), to R30 per day because, as we all know, there have been considerable increases in costs since November 1973. This increase will be announced in the <i>Gazette</i> in due course.</p>

<p>Coming back to the Bill, Mr. President, I want to say that it is obviously necessary and good that there must be a provision in our Constitution which excludes members of Parliament and of the Provincial Councils from occupying at the same time as they are members of Parliament and of the Provincial Councils, offices of profit under the State because there can obviously be a conflict of interest where such members occupy offices of profit under the State. The duty of members of Parliament&#x2014;that includes hon. Senators and, at another level, members of a provincial council&#x2014;is to attempt to control&#x2014; and I would like to impress this upon hon. Senators&#x2014;the executive. And if a member holds an office of profit under the State there is a conflict of interest between that office of profit and his duty to attempt to control the executive because, since time immemorial in fact, the whole parliamentary institution has been an institution that has sought to control either the monarch, the executive president or the executive. So clearly there is a need to exclude holders of offices of profit under the State, generally speaking, from holding situations as members of Parliament or of provincial councils as well. That need is clearly there and it is recognized by our Constitution in which it is embodied. On the other hand, Sir, there is clearly a need to make certain exceptions because one does not want to deprive the country and the State of the services of members of Parliament in various other spheres like commissions of inquiry, committees of inquiry, standing committees and standing commissions. That would be quite wrong. It would be wrong to deprive the State and the country of the services of members of Parliament in certain fields outside Parliament simply because they were parliamentarians. The problem is to find the correct dividing line. I know the select committee to which the hon. the Minister has referred, went a long way in their investigations in an endeavour to find the correct dividing line. Where does one draw the line? I am glad that the hon. the Minister paid tribute to that select committee. I believe it did very good work. I believe that its work has not been fruitless and that that work will receive further consideration. I am glad that that is so.</p>
<p>Reverting to the Bill before the House, it is necessary as a bridging measure until the select committee&#x2019;s recommendations have received further consideration and are in turn translated into law. Therefore we shall support the Bill which the hon. the Minister has introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. President, before dealing with the legislation before the House, I should also like to express a few thoughts in regard to my association with you over the years and in regard to your new appointment.</p>
<p>I have had the privilege over a period of 14 years of working very closely with you as chairman and member of the Justice, Police and Prisons group in this House which, together with the same group in the Other Place, had many consultations with you. Throughout the years I have always admired your competence, your diligence, your insight and so on. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking you most sincerely on behalf of that group for the wonderful service you rendered. I could not do this at the last meeting of the group, Mr. President, because I do not think I was then aware of your elevated status and neither were the other members of the group.</p>
<p>Mr. President, you have had a very active period of service. History shows that the Minister who occupies the Justice portfolio is really the person in the line of fire. In my view you have always handled the situation competently and carried out your duties successfully. I should like to express the hope that your service in this House will be long, happy and definitely more peaceful than was the case when you sat on the ministerial benches.</p>
<p>I should like to express a few thoughts on the legislation before us. The hon. the Minister has dealt very fully with the position. The hon. Senator Horak made some good points in connection with it. What often strikes me is that we have a Parliament in South Africa which does not even sit for a full half-year. In the meantime its business does not come to a standstill. The constitutional position in particular is very dynamic at this stage. It is a position which must be taken into account and considered carefully. Not only the constitutional position but very many other matters as well must be attended to during the recess and, because of the work done by commissions, the time taken up by business in Parliament will definitely be shortened by reports and so on which must be submitted. People with experience of commission work will realize that if we did not have a system of commissions in this country, and if the work, the taking of evidence and so on which commissions do, had all to be done by Parliament, we would probably have to sit from 1 January to 31 December, by which time, I fear, we would still not have finished. This is legislation the practical application of which will not involve the country in any additional expenditure. In fact, it will bring about a saving. I was pleased to hear the announcement of the hon. the Minister regarding an increase in allowances for the members concerned. The expenses of the members concerned, as the hon. Minister so rightly said, are a great deal higher than they used to be. When I was a member of the provincial council&#x2014;and I think the hon. the Minister arrived shortly after I had&#x2014;we received a monthly salary of £15 a month.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is just not possible for the official Opposition to support the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the House. It is well known that when dealing with the various reports of the Erasmus Commission, the Opposition has frequently referred to the part played by the former Prime Minister in the Information scandal. We have been very critical of his role in this matter. Apart from that, in our view he certainly did the highest office in the country no service when in his position as State President he went out of his way to enter into a polemic in public with a retired former Minister. Accordingly we find ourselves in the position where we cannot under any circumstances support this motion and we shall be compelled to vote against it.</p>

<p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House have no material objections to any clause contained in this Bill. The Bill embodies no principles. It deals with various matters which, as the hon. the Minister correctly said, are expounded in the explanatory memorandum.</p>
<p>As far as clause 18 is concerned, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could not furnish us with a further explanation. The hon. the Minister says in the explanatory memorandum that this amendment was inserted on the recommendation of the Select Committee on Public Accounts. The question we should like to have answered is why the Select Committee on Public Accounts was not brought into this amendment, because as we see it, this would have placed the matter beyond any doubt. As the clause reads at present, it is only after consultation between the hon. the Minister, the Auditor-General and the Prime Minister that it will be reported on or not. We feel that if we could have this matter referred to the Select Committee on Public Accounts and they could give it their approval or disapproval, the matter would be beyond all doubt. The Select Committee on Public Accounts is the body established to call to account and give account in this Parliament of the way in which money is spent in the public interest by the Parliament of South Africa. The hon. the Minister will agree with me in this regard. If the hon. the Minister can give us a satisfactory explanation, we shall be much obliged.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Swanepoel referred to clause 18 and I think what his question amounts to is whether the Select Committee should not also have a say in determining what should be left out of the Auditor&#x2019;s report. The position is in fact that the security of the State is the responsibility of the Executive, which will determine what information may be publicized when it is a matter of secret information. That, in fact, is the situation in a nutshell. In other words, as it is stated here, the decision would rest with the Minister of Finance after consultation with the Prime Minister, in the sense that the Prime Minister is the chief of State Security, and also after consultation with the Auditor-General, who is an officer of Parliament. He is directly responsible to Parliament and, of course, to the Select Committee itself. The clause provides then, that there must also be consultation with the Auditor-General, who represents Parliament. I do not think it would be advisable to go further than that in legislation. <i>Ad hoc</i> arrangements may be made to inform speakers on financial matters, as is in fact done in regard to other confidential matters relating to foreign affairs. I believe that the Minister of Finance ought in practice to have the right to decide on this in consultation with the Prime Minister. This ought not, in my opinion, to be prescribed in legislation. It is by no means the intention in this regard that the Select Committee should be excluded. However, where any report of the Auditor-General is available to the Select Committee, we felt that it was perhaps the most effective and practical way to do this. The Select Committee itself will then be able to report to Parliament, and Parliament can then decide how the matter should be taken further. I hope that will satisfy the hon. Senator.</p>

<p>Clause 18:</p>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment as printed on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">In B. 117A, on page 2, in the fourth and fifth lines, to omit &#x201C;after consultation with the Prime Minister and the Auditor-General&#x201D; and to substitute:<br/>in consultation with the Prime Minister, the Auditor-General and the Select Committee on Public Accounts</block>
<p>If I understood him correctly, the hon. the Minister said that a decision would be taken not after consultation, but in consultation with the hon. the Prime Minister &#x2026;</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>I said that that was what would happen in practice as far as the Prime Minister was concerned.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, but if that is what will happen in practice, then that is sufficient reason to replace the word &#x201C;after&#x201D; with &#x201C;in&#x201D;, viz. &#x201C;in consultation&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Because if that is the case in practice, then I see no reason why the word &#x201C;after&#x201D; should be used and not &#x201C;in&#x201D;. That is the first point I want to raise.</p>
<p>The next point the hon. the Minister made is that <i>ad hoc</i> statements can be made to spokesmen on finance, and I take it that he means by the spokesmen of the various parties. I take it, too, that the statements will be made by the hon. the Minister or by an official of his department, because I do not believe the Auditor-General will do it. After all, that is the duty of the Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>Now, the fact is that spokesmen of the various parties who usually discuss finance are usually also those people who represent their parties on the Select Committee on Public Accounts. Therefore, what the hon. the Minister has in fact told me is that he will give information on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to the chief spokesmen on finance of the various parties from time to time. What this will amount to in fact is that the same information can be furnished to the Select Committee on Public Accounts because it is after all with this committee that the Minister will discuss the confidential matters. I and my party realize that there are sensitive matters and projects about which we should prefer not to have leakages of information. However, I also have sufficient faith in the members of Parliament of South Africa to be satisfied that if they are trusted, they will not violate that trust, particularly where it could affect the security of our country.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I am therefore of the opinion that the amendment we have moved deserves the favourable consideration of the hon. House.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#poorter">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I doubt whether the hon. Senator&#x2019;s amendment is entirely satisfactory because it will place an obligation on the hon. the Minister of Finance whereas the clause as it stands gives him a discretion. If we are going to obligate the hon. the Minister of Finance to share confidential information with a field of people wider than he considers to be in the national interest, we will today be passing legislation which will be tantamount to endangering the security of the State. I think we must trust the hon. the Minister to use his discretion, as he has done in the past and will do in the future, to know when it is right and when it is not right to share such confidential information. I appeal to hon. Senators opposite to withdraw their amendment because I do not believe it is in the interests of the State to carry on with it.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not quite honestly understand the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter&#x2019;s argument with regard to the greater responsibility that the amendment seeks to place upon the hon. the Minister of Finance. In fact, the amendment reduces the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility in two ways. First of all, it brings the Select Committee on Public Accounts into consultation, so it makes his task a little easier, not more difficult. It brings an extra agency to the people who have to consult about this matter. Therefore, it lightens the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility and does not increase it. It may complicate it but it lightens the responsibility and the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter used the word &#x201C;responsibility&#x2019; &#x2019;.</p>
<p>Secondly, it also lightens his responsibility with regard to his consultation with the hon. the Prime Minister. As this clause is worded now the Minister shall, after consultation with the Prime Minister, do various things. That means that if he disagrees with the Prime Minister he goes on and does those things despite the disagreement with the Prime Minister, which is a tremendous responsibility to place on the Minister of Finance. We are saying to him in this Bill &#x2026; [Interjections .] Yes, that is exactly the responsibility that is on his shoulders and that is why I do not understand the hon. Senator Poorter&#x2019;s argument. We are trying to help the hon. the Minister by saying &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D;, which means that they must both agree. We are trying to help the hon. the Minister and we do not want him&#x2014;well, perhaps we do, in practice&#x2014;to be fired. This amendment therefore seeks a lightening of the responsibility upon the hon. the Minister.</p>
<p>It also does something else. By seeking to bring in the Select Committee on Public Accounts it is trying to bring in an instrument of the legislature. It is taking this decision out of the field of the executive only. We know why Parliament is here and we know the history of the development of Parliament. It is a history of seeking to control the executive in matters of finance. King Charles I ultimately had his head chopped off because of this type of conflict between the executive, the monarchy in those days, and Parliament. It is Parliament&#x2019;s task and duty&#x2014;and probably its primary duty&#x2014;to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer in controlling the expenditure of moneys. By bringing the Select Committee on Public Accounts in here we are bringing Parliament into the picture. We are adding Parliament to the executive picture which is the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. In terms of the constitutional development of democracy I think that is a very sound principle and I will therefore vote for this amendment.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, we have given very close thought to this matter and I have listened very carefully to the hon. Senator Horak and other speakers. Let me say first of all that in practice in virtually all cases the Minister of Finance will want to do this in consultation with the Prime Minister. He is not going to look for points of difference and I think in practice this will substantially be the position, after consulting also with the Auditor-General. As I see it there is, therefore, no practical problem.</p>
<p>There is a legal view that there is in fact very little difference in law between the expressions &#x201C;after consultation with&#x201D; and &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D;. I am not competent to carry this argument too far but this is how it has been worded by the law advisers after long discussion. My own view is that as far as the formal wording is concerned it is probably right to say &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D; with the Prime Minister in that the Minister of Finance will have to take the final responsibility. I think this is correct in a matter of this kind. If it is a contentious matter and one which may lead to a lot of debate, I do not think the Prime Minister should be directly involved. The Minister of Finance will certainly give very careful attention to the way the Prime Minister feels and I am sure that he will go out of his way to accept it, but nevertheless I think that from a legal point of view the wording should be left as it is. That is also how the Treasury and the Auditor-General feel.</p>
<p>As regards the Select Committee on Public Accounts it must be borne in mind that the Auditor-General is an officer of Parliament who reports to Parliament. All we are doing here is saying that in really sensitive matters there ought to be a provision that a report he draws up can be submitted to the Minister of Finance who, in consultation with the Prime Minister and with the Auditor-General, may then decide that it is in the public interest or for reasons of national security that something should be left out. I think the amendment effected in the Other Place makes this position clear and its wording is better than the original.</p>
<p>To my way of thinking it will be more correct to leave this matter in the hands of the executive. Supposing a very difficult matter arises, what would the Minister of Finance do? He would take the matter to the Cabinet with the consent of the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Yes, that is the executive. But you have the Auditor-General fully in the picture in that he draws up a report and is consulted as to whether something should be left out. By submitting this report to a committee of Parliament&#x2014;the Select Committee on Public Accounts is a committee of Parliament&#x2014;you certainly cannot say that you are bypassing Parliament. However, you are not saying that you are asking the Select Committee to have a part in the decision as to whether something should be left out I agree with that. But fundamentally, if it is a very difficult matter, I believe this would be a Cabinet decision. That is how we see it That is how the Treasury sees it and that is how the Auditor-General himself sees it. I do not wish to be dogmatic but I must say that I am persuaded by that point of view and as a result will find it difficult to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. President, at this stage I just want to say with regard to the clause which, as the hon. the Minister is aware, relates to matters which have dominated virtually our entire debate during this past session, that I should greatly appreciate it if the hon. the Minister and his law advisers were to take another look at this amendment we have moved. I did not want to prolong discussion of the matter during the Committee Stage. We took note of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s standpoint, and bandying arguments across the floor concerning minor technical points will make no difference to the arguments on principle which both he and I mentioned here. Unfortunately they are irreconcilable. But I hope the hon. the Minister will take another look at this and hold consultations on the matter. I am still convinced that our Select Committee on Public Accounts&#x2014;I use the phrase used a moment ago by the hon. Senator&#x2014;is for all practical purposes a responsible body which can share in the responsibility of decision-taking in regard to these matters. Apart from that, Mr. President, I believe that the decisions which the hon. the Minister will eventually take can be influenced by opinions advanced by these gentlemen. And perhaps the Minister could be beneficially influenced to take the correct decision relating to the report which the Auditor-General will publish. My opinion in regard to these matters is that it is only in the case of extremely sensitive matters that the report of the Auditor-General should not be published. For the rest, wherever possible, we should play open cards, not only with the Parliament of South Africa, but also with the public and the voters who send their representatives here.</p>

As I have already said, I do not wish to be dogmatic, but that is our considered opinion at this stage.

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>It is true that the so-called revenue laws, i.e. transfer duty, stamp duty, estate duty and the duty on marketable securities, no longer play the same role in the fiscal structure of our country as they did a century ago. Nevertheless, they remain valuable and indispensable sources of revenue for the State. Although it may not be a matter of great interest or offer much consolation to those who become liable to pay these taxes and who find that they have to make a contribution to the Treasury, it is nevertheless interesting that two of the levies, i.e. stamp duty and transfer duty, have a history which goes back to the centuries when the idea of a settlement at this southern tip of the continent of Africa was no more than a dream of our forefathers. Transfer duty virtually came ashore with Simon van der Stel and was first levied in South Africa in 1686, while stamp duty immigrated not long afterwards. Estate duty too is a tax which originated beyond our borders but it has been levied here in some form for so many years that it can no longer be regarded as a stranger. To abandon these well-proven and profitable forms of taxation at this stage would be foolish, but it must also be admitted that in order to retain its value any tax system has to keep abreast of changing times and circumstances. The object of this Bill, therefore, is of a two-fold nature: Firstly, it gives effect to the tax proposals I announced in my budget speech and, secondly, it introduces certain amendments which have become necessary as a result of changing circumstances. I may add that the latter amendments originated from representations received from inside as well as outside Parliament. Hon. Senators will readily understand that it has not been possible to accept all the proposals&#x2014;to have done so would have meant that no taxes whatsoever could be levied&#x2014;but where it has been at all possible to comply with reasonable and practical proposals, this has been done.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed, Mr. President, to discuss the various clauses of the Bill.</p>
<p>The Marketable Securities Act, 1948, provides for the levying of a tax with regard to every purchase of marketable securities by a stockbroker on behalf of someone else. In other words, it is a tax on transactions taking place on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The present rate of taxation is 1&#x00BD;% of the amount for which the marketable securities are bought. The amendment introduced by clause 1 reduces the rate of taxation to 1% of the purchase price of the marketable securities. Since the concession made in 1977, the effective rate of this tax is only 50% of what it was two years ago.</p>
<p>Clause 2 introduces two amendments to section 9A of the Transfer Duty Act, 1949. Hon. Senators will remember that in terms of the Sectional Titles Act, 1971, which came into operation on 30 March 1973, it became possible to obtain ownership of, for example, one flat in a block of flats. As far back as the &#x2019;forties, however, some people obtained the right to occupy flats permanently by buying so-called block shares in development companies. Section 23 of the Sectional Titles Act provided for the conversion of such rights of occupation into rights of ownership and, in order to enable the holders of block shares to avail themselves of this facility without paying an unreasonable amount in transfer duty, section 9A of the Transfer Duty Act provides that the amount of the transfer duty shall be based on the amount which the occupant of the flat paid for his block shares, as well as his share of the cost of drawing up the sectional plan. A further effect of the section is that transfer duty shall be calculated at the rate which applied on the date on which the block shares were bought. Because the implementation of the Sectional Titles Act was not expected to present any problems, the said section 9A allowed the holders of block shares a period of one year after the date of commencement of the Sectional Titles Act to make use of this concession. If they did not act in time, a penalty would be payable as from 30 September 1974 at the rate of 7&#x00BD;% per annum.</p>
<p>In practice, the Sectional Titles Act presented several initial problems with the result that few, if any, block shareholders made use of their rights in terms of section 23 of that Act and, as far as is known, no one benefited by the provisions of section 9A of the Transfer Duty Act.</p>
<p>The present provisions of section 9A now virtually prohibit the conversion of rights of occupation into rights of ownership, for even if the amounts of transfer duty are still reasonable a penalty is payable at the rate of 7&#x00BD;% per annum as from 30 September 1974. That is a period of one year after the date of commencement of the Sectional Titles Act&#x2014; which was 30 March 1973&#x2014;plus the six months&#x2019; grace allowed by the Transfer Duty Act. In addition, there is the fact that the rates of transfer duty have been considerably reduced since 1973, even to the point where in spite of today&#x2019;s increased prices, the value of some flats is low enough as to result in total exemption from transfer duty or to ensure, in any event, that the transfer duty will be considerably less than the amount, plus the penalty which would be payable in terms of section 9A if it were decided to obtain ownership.</p>
<p>Accordingly, clause 3 introduces two amendments. In the first place, it extends the period within which it is possible to make use of section 9A, but without paying a penalty on transfer duty. This concession will benefit those who bought their block shares years ago at a low price. It must be noted that the conversion of right of occupation into right of ownership must take place before 30 September 1981 in order to avoid payment of the penalty.</p>
<p>The second amendment provides that the person who wants to have his right of occupation converted into a right of ownership can choose not to make use of the provisions of section 9A. If he does exercise a choice, the transfer duty will be determined in accordance with the usual rules, i.e. on the value of the property at the date of payment of the transfer duty at the rate applicable at that date.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I come now to the question of estate duty. This duty is levied on the taxable amount of any estate. The expression &#x201C;estate&#x201D; includes not only tangible assets such as immovable property, bank deposits, shares, etc. but also rights such as annuities and usufructs which pass to someone else on a person&#x2019;s death. In order to combat tax evasion, property which is deemed to have belonged to the deceased is also being brought into the ambit of the Act. Included in this category is a right to an annuity paid by a fund. This concept includes an annuity paid by a pension fund or a retirement annuity fund which wholly or partly survives the deceased and which is paid to another person&#x2014;usually his widow&#x2014;after his death. In such a case, the value of the annuity is calculated at 12% over the expected life of the annuitant, and the amount thus capitalized is included in the property of the deceased.</p>

<p>That is blood out of a stone!</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Wait a moment&#x2014;I have still to deal with a few other concessions. Representations have been made to my department and myself from time to time for the exclusion of this capitalized amount from the value of an estate. In many cases the inclusion of the amount is merely of academic interest because most pensioners who die do not have sufficient assets to make their estates liable for estate duty, especially if they were married and had children or when husband and wife were both elderly and the capitalized value is not great. There may be exceptions, however, and even though my department has not yet encountered the exceptional case of the man with a big pension and a young wife and children&#x2014;i.e. the case where the capitalized value may be great&#x2014;it is nevertheless possible that cases may come to light where the levying of estate duty on this right which passes to someone else at the death of a pensioner may cause hardship for the remaining spouse. I therefore propose that section 3(3)(a)<i>bis</i> of the Estate Duty Act be amended to provide that the capitalized value of an annuity payable by a pension fund which has been approved for the purposes of the Income Tax Act will no longer be regarded as property which is deemed to be property of the deceased. The relevant amendment is contained in clause 3 of the Bill.</p>
<p>You may well ask, Mr. President, why a similar concession is not being proposed in respect of annuities paid by retirement annuity funds. My reply to that is that there is a clear distinction between pension funds and retirement annuity funds as well as between the circumstances in which contributions are made to such funds. In the case of a pension fund, the employee usually has no choice. Membership is a condition of employment and his contributions are simply deducted from his remuneration. The employer adds his contribution and the total amount is then paid into the fund where it remains until such time as the employee reaches retirement age. If the former employee dies after having retired leaving a widow, the pension which survives him and which passes to his widow or other dependants is the product of the contributions made by his employer as well as by himself.</p>
<p>In the case of a non-contributory pension fund, of course, the full pension is to be attributed to the goodwill of the employer. However, the choice of joining a retirement annuity fund or not is entirely up to the individual. Furthermore, it is for him to decide upon the size of his annual contribution. If he makes use of the generous concessions provided for in this year&#x2019;s Income Tax Bill he will not only considerably reduce his current income tax burden but he will also be paying amounts into a fund which would otherwise have been paid into other investments which would eventually have been subject to estate duty.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, clause 4 of the Bill makes two further amendments to the Estate Duty Act. These amendments give effect to two of the concessions announced in my Budget speech on 28 March. In determining the net value of an estate for estate duty purposes various deductions may be made. Two of these are (a) so much of the proceeds of insurance policies on the life of the deceased and of the value of the benefits from pension, provident or retirement annuity funds passing as a result of the death of the deceased as does not exceed R35 000 and (b) so much of the value of certain public bonds and stock and of Land Bank debentures as does not exceed the difference between the sum of R70 000 and the amount deducted in respect of insurance and fund benefits. If therefore on the death of a deceased his estate collects R25 000 in respect of insurance policy proceeds and has R50 000 invested in Land Bank debentures, a total of R70 000 will be deductible in determining the net value of his estate.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments will increase the amounts deductible under these two headings from R35 000 to R40 000 and from R70 000 to R80 000, respectively.</p>
<p>From the net value of an estate, certain further deductions are made in order to arrive at the dutiable amount on which the tax is finally calculated. There are four such deductions, each of R30 000, the principal ones being the standard deduction, the deduction in respect of a surviving spouse and the deduction in respect of each surviving child of the deceased. The amendments to be introduced by clause 4 will increase each of these deductions to R35 000.</p>
<p>The combined effect of all these amendments to the Estate Duty Act will be of material value to many estates.</p>
<p>I turn now to the amendments to the Stamp Duties Act, 1968. The amendment made in terms of clause 6 to section 22 of the Act is of a purely textual nature and flows from the deletion of section 5(3) of the Act in 1977.</p>
<p>Clause 7 introduces an amendment to Item 11 of Schedule 1 of the Stamp Duties Act. Due to a customs tariff amendment the existing wording of the Item no longer describes the relevant documents correctly. In plain language the exemption covers the customs documents relating to the temporary importation of motor vehicles, yachts and other goods which are the <i>bona fide</i> property of tourists and which are to be re-exported within 12 months. The amendment extends the scope of the existing exemption very slightly but hon. Senators will be glad to learn that, at a total cost of a mere R200 per annum, a source of annoyance to tourists and an inconvenience to customs authorities at points of entry into South Africa, will be eliminated.</p>
<p>The next clause, that is clause 8, amends Item 15 of the Stamp Duties Act. That Item governs the payment of duty on the registration of transfer of marketable securities, on the cancellation of certain shares and on the acquisition of marketable securities not involving the registration of transfer. As hon. Senators will be aware, the stamp duty payable under this item and the Marketable Securities Tax are complementary. Where marketable securities are bought on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Marketable Securities Tax is payable and there is an exemption from stamp duty on the registration of those securities. Where securities are purchased outside the Exchange then stamp duty is payable whether or not registration of transfer takes place. Since 1977 there has been complete neutrality between Marketable Securities Tax and stamp duty in the sense that the rate of both tax and duty has been the same, that is, one and a half per cent of the consideration payable in respect of the marketable securities. In view of the decision to reduce the rate of Marketable Securities Tax to one per cent it follows that in order to maintain neutrality between the two levies, the stamp duty likewise has had to be reduced to one per cent. The amendments which clause 8 introduces are designed to give effect to this reduction in the rate of the duty.</p>
<p>I come now, Mr. President, to the last clause in the Bill, that is clause 9, which returns to the matter of estate duty. The present Estate Duty Act of 1955 repealed the Death Duties Act of 1922, but only as regards the estates of persons who died or who die on or after 1 April 1955. The 1922 Act contained similar provisions, which means that both the 1922 and much earlier Acts going back well into the last century are still applicable in regard to the estates of, or successions arising by reason of the death of, persons who died prior to 1 April 1955. Now, as is well known, some persons seek to rule from the grave and the wills of a few persons who died many decades ago are still operative. In the result, a succession under one of these old estates occasionally comes to light and succession duty becomes payable. As is to be expected, cases of this nature will become fewer and further between with the passage of time and the stage has now been reached where the possible small amount of revenue from this source can no longer justify the administrative work involved in watching out for liability under these old laws and, when found, assessing and collecting the duty due. The provisions of this clause will terminate liability under these old laws in all cases where such liability had not been determined prior to the date of commencement of the Revenue Laws Amendment Act, 1979.</p>
<p>As indicated earlier, Mr. President, we shall continue to review these taxation laws at regular intervals and, if necessary, we shall introduce suitable amendments from time to time.</p>
<p>I commend this Bill to the Senate.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister dealt with a wide variety of matters in his Second Reading speech, some of which we support and welcome.</p>
<p>At the start of his Second Reading speech, the hon. the Minister mentioned that many of these present laws of which we make use today such as the Administration of Estates Act are very old Acts and that they were a very good source of revenue and that it would therefore be difficult for the Treasury to repeal them. In any event I want to say to the hon. the Minister that the fact that these Acts are so old does not in my opinion constitute sufficient reason for them to be retained. The hon. the Minister will agree with me that at the present stage we in South Africa are engaged in tax reform, as one might call it, to such an extent that I believe the hon. the Minister is attempting to encourage rather than counter capital formation. If we retain the Estate Duty Act which, in many cases, imposes such a heavy duty on an estate that much of it has to be disposed of to pay the tax, we shall certainly not be encouraging capital formation; indeed we shall be counteracting it.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister said that estate duty was no stranger in South Africa. In that regard I agree with him. It is no stranger. It is so old and so well-known that it has a beard. It is a source of great inconvenience in regard to many estates and one feels that one cannot really condone such a thing when one bears in mind that one has worked throughout one&#x2019;s life to accumulate something and when one&#x2019;s children come to inherit it, what one has toiled and worked hard for has to be given to the State.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister also referred to pensions or annuities which are continued with after a person&#x2019;s death. In my opinion all hon. Senators and members of Parliament are included in this category, because our pensions will continue, although in smaller amounts, if our spouses survive us.</p>

<p>This would then be included in the estate. I have taken note of the percentage tax. In such a case, says the hon. the Minister, the value of the annuity is calculated at 12% of the probable life of the annuitant. I believe that in many instances, tax can be levied that could be of such a nature, due to the inclusion of these pensions, that in fact it could reduce the average life of such a person instead of lengthening it. It could come as such a shock.</p>

<p>That and tax; unfortunately tax as well.</p>
<p>Moreover I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I think that the idea of reducing the tax on marketable securities is a very good idea. If it will help in any way to lend more life to our stock market in the non-gold shares section, then I shall really be very grateful to the hon. the Minister. This does not mean that I am a very big investor in that type of share, Sir, but it is nevertheless a fact that the Stock Exchange is the barometer of growth and confidence in our economy. Greater investments in the Stock Exchange can therefore be encouraged by way of this type of reduction in tax, particularly if one bears in mind that when one purchases large quantities of shares, a half per cent can make a very big difference, particularly if the prices are in accordance.</p>
<p>Mr. President, another matter on which I was not really able to obtain clarity from the hon. the Minister during the Second Reading was the question of a concession granted in regard to pensions and not retirement funds. The hon. the Minister advances as a reason for this that there is a clear distinction to be drawn between pension funds and annuity funds, and that is understandable. But I do not regard it as a convincing reason why the concession should be made in the one case and not in the other. I should therefore be obliged if the hon. the Minister could give us a further explanation of this.</p>
<p>With these few words, Mr. President, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that we support the Bill. For the most part it gives effect to the proposals he made in his budget speech. These have already been discussed on previous occasions and are now simply being moulded into laws in order eventually to be put into effect.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Swanepoel rightly said that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech covered a wide variety of matters embodied in the Bill at present before the House. As the hon. the Minister said, the matters embodied in the Bill are all important and indispensable sources of revenue&#x2014;indeed, traditional sources of revenue. In fact this only gives effect to tax proposals that have already been put before the House. Having listened to the explanation by the hon. the Minister, we were content, but now that I have listened to the hon. Senator Swanepoel, I am again inclined to agree with him. When one takes both standpoints into account one must in my opinion decide what is popular and what is responsible. It goes without saying, therefore, that the hon. the Minister adopted a responsible attitude.</p>
<p>I should like to put the following idea to the hon. the Minister. Whereas certain concessions are being made, particularly with regard to estate duty&#x2014;and they are important concessions&#x2014;are these concessions that are made from year to year keeping pace with the constant reduction in the value of money? In my opinion that is the crux of the problem.</p>

<p>Judging from that interjection I infer that that is a remark which enjoys widespread sympathy. However, I think that this is something which ought to be taken into account throughout the system of taxation. In some cases it seems as if there is no adjustment of the rate of taxation in the tax system because due to the fact that the value of money is dwindling, tax is increasing.</p>
<p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House realize that much good will come of this Bill. It embodies important concessions, other important matters are rationalized and we therefore support the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I do not know whether I understood the hon. the Minister to say that the provisions of the new subsection (a)(<i>bis</i>) would not apply to pensions towards which the original drawer of the pension had to contribute during his working life. Let me put this direct question, Sir, because I think we are all interested in this particular matter. Do the pensions which we as retired Senators will begin to draw when we retire fall within the ambit of this amendment?</p>

Do parliamentary pensions fall within that exclusion?</p>

<p>Well, Mr. President, I am very grateful, and I will now not challenge those hon. Senators any longer. But I am not sure whether they understood the matter correctly either because one of them said &#x201C;wet van Transvaal&#x201D;, which meant that he anticipated that his pension in his widow&#x2019;s hands would be taxed. So they did not really know what the position was and neither did I. But the hon. the Minister now says that our pensions are excluded. I declare a personal interest on behalf of my widow one day and so I shall not take the matter any further.</p>
<p>But there is a very interesting constitutional matter that arises out of the shape in which this Bill has come to us. This is, as the hon. the Minister will accept, an omnibus Bill which amends various existing pieces of legislation such as the Marketable, Securities Tax Act, the Transfer Duty Act, the Estate Duty Act and the Stamp Duties Act. There are four that I can see that this Bill as an omnibus Bill amends. Now, section 60(3) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Senate may not amend any Bills so far as they impose taxation or charges, or appropriate revenue or moneys for the services of the Government.</block>
<p>Strictly legally interpreted that means that if this Senate does not like one clause in this Bill but it likes all the others, it cannot move for the amendment or deletion of that clause because that would be amending the whole Bill. The only remedy would then be to vote against the whole Bill. This arises out of the omnibus nature of Bills of this sort.</p>
<p>Mr. President, this House will know what my views are about omnibus Bills. I have always said that I do not like them. I have always said that we must have separate Bills amending original Acts. Now this omnibus Bill&#x2014;and I am quite serious about this&#x2014; brings us into a position where we are bound by the provisions of section 60 of the Constitution of South Africa.</p>

<p>This Bill imposes taxation or charges, but in fact it is not one Bill. There are four Bills here; there might be more, but four that I can see immediately. So, Sir, we have a constitutional contretemps here, a constitutional problem, a Harry Schwarz, in fact. That is how we in the NRP refer to our ex-colleague; we call a problem a Harry Schwarz. Well, here we are; we have a Harry Schwarz here; we have a problem. It is an interesting and very difficult constitutional problem. I might wish to vote against a particular subsection&#x2014; (a)<i>bis</i> dealing with estate duties&#x2014;because I do not like it, but I cannot do that because I would be amending this Bill. I will, therefore, have to vote against the whole Bill if I do not like that subsection. To me as a one-time lawyer it raises an interesting point. I see the hon. the Minister has something in his hand so I will sit down now and ask him to reply to the debate. We can perhaps take this further a little later.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I was just going to express the hope that because the capitalized value of a widow&#x2019;s pension is no longer included in the amount subject to the estate duty, the hon.

<p>I am glad the hon. Senator raised the point, because it is a very interesting constitutional one. It is something one would like to think about further. I daresay that in future when we start imposing taxes, which I hope will not happen in a hurry, we may have to put them up one by one.</p>
<p>*I want to thank all hon. Senators most sincerely for their support of this measure. I should also like to refer to the question of estate duty. Estate duty still exists in South Africa today, but in recent years considerable relief has been granted in this regard. In this connection I want to use the example of a widow with two children. If the total net value of her late husband&#x2019;s estate, including the proceeds from insurance policies or Government stock to the value of R25 000, amounts to R140 000, no estate duty will be payable in these circumstances. In 1948, the first figure I have, estate duty of R33 000 or 23% would have been payable. In 1964, estate duty of R14 000 or 10% would have been payable on an estate of R140 000. In 1948, an estate of R200 000 would have been subject to an estate duty of almost R65 000, which amounts to almost one-third of the estate. In 1964, it would have been R29 000, or less than 15%, whereas today it is R5 000 or 2&#x00BD;%. Therefore this is a considerable decrease. On an estate of R300 000&#x2014;this will probably be our good farming friends and not us&#x2014;the duty in 1948 was R107 000, almost 36%, in 1964 it was R54 000, or 18%, whereas today it is R27 000 or 9%. I must concede that to an extent estate duty is an inconvenient tax, but if one bears in mind that the State receives between R40 million and R60 million, depending on the state of the economy, from this source every year, this is not something that can be summarily abolished, particularly if one considers notes that the demands being made on the Exchequer today for Defence and security purposes are very high. However, I have furnished these comparisons to indicate that we have already granted considerable relief in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Swanepoel referred to the distinction we draw between a pension and a retirement annuity and the matter of capitalizing the income received under those two headings for the purpose of estate duty. We are now going to eliminate the capitalized value of pensions from a recognized pension fund, whereas we are not going to do that in the case of retirement annuity fund benefits. It is simply a case of the view one takes of these two. As we see it, and always have seen it, there is a fairly substantial difference as regards the nature of these two funds. I do not wish to repeat all of them but just let me run through a few of them quickly.</p>
<p>Membership of a pension fund is compulsory, which means that an employee has no discretion in the matter. The employer recovers the employee&#x2019;s contributions from the latter&#x2019;s pay, he adds his own contribution and pays the combined amount over to the fund. In the fullness of time an annuity becomes payable to the member or to his dependants. The self-employed person does have a discretion. He may decide to enjoy his money now or he may decide to join a retirement annuity fund. If he does so decide he can shop around and join the fund which best suits his purpose.</p>
<p>Employers as well as employees contribute to pension funds. Sometimes an employer contributes very generously and he may even bear all the contributions in some cases. The pension which eventually becomes payable to the retired employee or to his dependants is therefore not solely the product of the employee&#x2019;s own thrift. Had he been able to bank the equivalent of his own contributions instead of paying them into the pension fund his estate would not have been swelled to the extent of the capitalized value of the pension payable to his widow. The annuity payable by a retirement annuity fund is, however, the product of the taxpayer&#x2019;s own savings. Had he, instead of joining the retirement annuity fund, deposited each month an amount equal to his contribution to the fund he would have had in the bank, together with accrued interest, at least as much as the capitalized value of the annuity payable to his widow on his death.</p>
<p>Most retirement annuity funds are underwritten by insurance companies and the amount which becomes available for the purchase of an annuity is, as indicated, the product of the member&#x2019;s contributions only. By way of contrast, some established pension funds are very wealthy and are able to pay annuities in excess of those normally based solely on the employer&#x2019;s and employee&#x2019;s own contributions. They sometimes build up very big reserve funds on which they receive considerable interest income.</p>
<p>Where a member of a retirement annuity fund retires and receives a pension, and then after a period of time dies, the annuity which his widow receives is normally a continuation of his own annuity. In other words, the widow steps into her husband&#x2019;s shoes. Clearly there is a valuable asset passing as a result of the husband&#x2019;s death. The position with pension funds is usually different for the widow normally becomes entitled to an annuity in her own right in terms of the rules of the fund. She is not, therefore, the successor to her late husband&#x2019;s pension. That pension would normally die with him.</p>
<p>Having said all this, I know that it is perhaps not quite as convincing as it sounds. However, there are people who feel that the taxing authority ought not to draw quite a sharp distinction between the two. As I said in the Other Place, I am quite prepared to ask the Registrar of Insurance to take this matter up with the Life Offices Association and with the Advisory Committee on Long Term Insurance to see what the general view might be in the industry at this moment. Perhaps we can have a very close and critical discussion about the matter and we can see how the matter stands next year. But I do hope that hon. Senators will feel that the concession we have made in regard to the pensions, and the fact that the capitalized value will fall away from the estate&#x2019;s value, is not too bad for the next few months.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I rise merely to point out to the hon. the Minister that in spite of the fact that we have been afforded relief in regard to estate duty over the years, it has still been the case every year that in spite of the relief, his estimated revenue from estate duty has been higher than the previous year. In those instances and in those years it was in my opinion the case that the relief afforded by the hon. the Minister did not keep pace with the reduction in the value of money. This year is the first year in which there will be an estimated reduction of R&#x00BD; million on the revenue of the previous year.</p>

<p>Listen to the amount which the hon. the Minister is nevertheless going to obtain by way of estate duty. The amount is R44&#x00BD; million, and the number of estates on which this duty is levied is not large. It would be interesting to know what the average duty per estate would be if one were to divide tins among the estates that are taxed, and what was the maximum and the minimum duty levied. I do not want this now, Sir; they are merely statistics that I mention for interest&#x2019;s sake.</p>
<p>Sir, it seems to me that the levying of duty is often done on a basis which the hon. Senator Horak is so fond of referring to as &#x201C;boereverneukery&#x201D;. When one takes the case of stamp duties, one sees that despite the relief we are being afforded, the Treasury will gain R19&#x00BD; million more this year than it did last year by way of stamp duty. In the case of transfer duty the figure is R10 million more than last year. Therefore, while we welcome the relief being afforded, I do think that it is only right that we should also point out to the hon. the Minister that this is a case of &#x201C;What you lose on the swings, you gain on the roundabouts&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I just want to make a few remarks in regard to the implementation of the Bill before the House. I do not think we ought to let the occasion pass without expressing our thanks and appreciation for the concessions set out in clause 4. I do not believe that at first glance the hon. Senators realize the extent of these concessions. In his reply to the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister mentioned comparative figures. We must note that in the case of a married couple, the abatement is basically being reduced twice by R5 000; in the case of children it is R5 000 for every child, and R5 000 on insurance policies etc., and what this amounts to is that in the case of a family with three children, an additional total concession of R30 000 is being granted. When we compare these figures with the first schedule of the Estate Duty Act and take an estate of R100 000 plus, we see that the savings amount to 25% above R100 000 on that increased amount. This means an amount of R7 500. If we take an estate of R300 000 plus, as would apply in the case of many of the hon. Senators opposite, if not all, we find that the saving is 35%. In this case the abatement is R30 000 and it means that estate duty is reduced by an amount of R10 500.</p>
<p>I rose merely to draw attention to this. We are so quick to complain about the tax position but I really think that at first glance we do not realize the extent of the concessions set out in clause 4.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I, too, am grateful for the concessions being made here, but I just want to react to what the hon. the Minister said a moment ago. He referred to rich farmers with estates of R300 000, and I want to say to the hon. the Minister that a decent farming enterprise is easily worth R300 000 today, but there are no cash savings with which to pay estate duty. The effect of this may be that an economic farming unit is destroyed thereby because the persons who have to inherit it have to get rid of essential sections of the farming enterprise and thus eventually make it an uneconomic proposition. I should be obliged if the hon. the Minister could give attention to this in the future and try to bring the arguments we use in this regard more into line with the truth.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I shall be very brief. In the first place I want to thank the hon. Senator Van Rensburg for the interesting figures he furnished to the House. I said certain things in a lighter vein but I accept that there are problems. I must say that I personally know of cases where the estate has been fairly large but where cash has not always been easily available. This is true, but it is largely for that reason that provision has been made for the amount that may be invested in assurance policies and Government stocks.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel referred to the fact that although relief had been effected with regard to estate duty, the earnings had not really dropped. I think this may be so, but that is not solely ascribable to depreciation in the value of money, but also to the population increase&#x2014;I think that is a factor&#x2014;and the increase in the number of estates reported. I think our statistics in this regard have been streamlined and made a little more effective than before.</p>
<p>As far as stamp and transfer duties are concerned, I must inform hon. Senators that the increases in the amounts levied are to some extent ascribable to an improvement in the property market and the Stock Exchange. I say that they are partly ascribable to this. Talking of the Stock Exchange, I recall what happened when I came here at the beginning of 1970. The hon. Senator Swanepoel was speakingzwhen I was listening to a financial debate for the first time. He was really hauling my predecessor over the coals concerning certain statements he had supposedly made in regard to the rise in Stock Exchange up to May 1969. He will recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>As I stated in my Budget speech on 28 March, we in South Africa are engaged in an important programme of tax reform the object of which is gradually to move away from the present system where the principal emphasis is placed on direct taxes to one where both direct and indirect taxes play a more balanced role. The first and historical step along that long and difficult road was taken last year when sales tax was introduced, and I am pleased to be able to say that as a result of thorough planning the proceeds from that source have already provided us with sufficient freedom of movement to be able to make the considerable income and other tax concessions which I announced on 28 March.</p>
<p>To those who, like Oliver Twist, expected more, I should like to mention that as in the case of politics, tax concessions are the art of the possible. Given a maximum tax revenue which we could afford to surrender, my department tried out no fewer than 13 possible combinations of tax rates, income abatements etc. before the right combination for the occasion was found. I am fully aware that, in view of the decline in the value of money, the level at which the maximum rate of taxation is reached&#x2014;55% on an income of R30 000 in the case of a married person&#x2014;is still not the level which we should like to see and, as soon as circumstances permit, further attention will be given to this matter. As I have said, however, the road ahead is not an easy one, and at this stage it is impossible, and in fact undesirable, to make any firm predictions. However, we are now moving in the right direction and it is expected that it will be possible to maintain the momentum. Hon. Senators are already in possession of a comprehensive explanatory memorandum on the Bill, yet I still think that a few words by way of explanation of the background to certain of the amendments as well as of matters which are receiving our attention or which are of general interest would not be inappropriate.</p>
<p>I shall consequently begin with the rates of tax for the coming year of assessment and in this connection I should like to draw the attention of hon. Senators to clauses 1, 2 and 5, as well as to the schedule to the Bill. As may be deduced from my previous remarks, the new scales should not be seen exclusively as a fiscal measure but also as a further step in our programme of reform. That the concessions in many cases are considerable will be realized next month by thousands of salary earners when the new deduction tables come into operation. Provisional taxpayers will share the same experience during August and, when the final assessments are issued after the close of the 1979-&#x2019;80 tax year and a final adjustment is made, this will come as a further bonus. I hope this will serve as an incentive and that returns will be submitted earlier and more expeditiously next year.</p>
<p>Clause 3 inserts amendments to certain definitions in section 1 of the principal Act. Some of these amendments will be discussed later when I come to clause 8 and in the meantime I shall confine myself to the question of the amalgamation of co-operative societies.</p>
<p>Section 94 of the Co-operative Societies Act lays down the rules that have to be followed when two or more co-operatives amalgamate. Actually the procedure is very simple. What actually happens is that the amalgamating co-operatives disappear and from them a new co-operative will arise which in reality is merely a continuation of the original co-operatives. However, the repercussions for the purposes of income tax are considerable, for any assessed loss which the amalgamating co-operatives may have had, will die with them. Moreover, if some of the debts which the new co-operative took over from the old ones subsequently appear to be irrecoverable, the amounts thus written off by the new co-operative may not be claimed as a deduction in determining taxable income. There are other repercussions as well which need not be spelt out here.</p>
<p>At present my department is reviewing the entire situation and will, it is hoped, be able to make suggestions in this connection within a few months. The amendment which is being inserted by clause 3(1)(e) is merely an interim measure intended to make the deduction of a bonus by the amalgamated co-operatives possible.</p>
<p>I may add here that it is in no way the intention to amend the position of ordinary companies which may amalgamate in terms of the Companies Act. Such amalgamations are not comparable with those which occur under section 94 of the Co-operative Societies Act and they shall continue to be subject to the present rules in the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>Clause 6 gives effect to the proposal in my Budget speech that a special tax rebate would be introduced for inhabitants of Walvis Bay. However, I must mention here that the reduced rates of tax, which will be applicable with effect from the 1980 year of assessment, will to a certain extent reduce the difference between the South African and the South West African taxes and will in some cases even eliminate it entirely.</p>
<p>The amendments to section 10 of the principal Act which are being inserted by clause 7 are primarily of a textual nature. The most important is perhaps the exemption in respect of the receipts and accruals of the South African Special Risk Insurance Association. This association was formed in order to provide insurance in respect of damage which may be suffered as a result of sedition.</p>
<p>†I come now, Mr. President, to the amendments which are to be made by clause 8 to various portions of section 11 of the principal Act. That section provides for the general deductions which may be taken into account in the determination of taxable income. Together with the reduction in the rates of tax, the increases in the abatements and the amendments to be made in terms of clause 13, these are perhaps the most important in the Bill, certainly as far as self-employed persons are concerned.</p>
<p>We have never sought to limit the amount which a taxpayer may contribute annually to a pension fund or a retirement annuity fund, but what the principal Act has done is to limit the contributions which may be deducted for income tax purposes. At one time the limits were fairly low, but they have been raised at regular intervals, especially during the past few years, and now stand at R1 750 in the case of a pension fund and R3 500 in the case of a retirement annuity fund. The R3 500 limit also applies where the taxpayer is a member of both types of funds. Where a taxpayer is earning, say, R10 000 a year, a maximum permissible deduction of R1 750 in respect of contributions to a pension fund is by no means ungenerous, but where he is fortunate enough to be earning, say, R40 000 a year an annual contribution of that order could seldom hope to secure him a pension which would be in keeping with his earnings. A somewhat similar situation applies in the case of a retirement annuity fund.</p>
<p>What we propose to do, therefore, is to allow a taxpayer to deduct by way of pension contributions an amount of up to 7,5% of his remuneration from retirement-funding employment. Where a taxpayer contributes to a retirement annuity fund he will in future be allowed to deduct up to 15% of his income from trade, after excluding his income from retirement-funding employment. The salaried man to whom I referred a moment ago who earns R40 000 a year, will thus be able to contribute R3 000 annually to a pension fund and have that amount deducted in the determination of his taxable income, while the professional man whose practice yields him a profit of R40 000 will be able to contribute R6 000 to a retirement annuity fund and have that amount deducted for income tax purposes. At this point I must emphasize that, while making these concessions, we are entrenching the existing deductions in the law, which means that someone whose income from trade is less than R23 334 will still be able to claim up to R1 750 in respect of pension fund contributions or R3 500 in respect of retirement annuity fund contributions. Where he is a member of both types of funds, the R3 500 limit also applies. In essense, then, these concessions will enable those persons with an annual income from trade in excess of R23 334 to lay-by more generously against the day that none of us mortals can hope to escape.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators may well raise the question: Why the difference between the amounts deductible in respect of pension contributions and those in respect of retirement annuity fund contributions? In this regard I may be traversing some of the same ground as earlier but I should like to put this briefly. The answer to this question is that, although the end result is the same in the sense that an annuity will one day be paid to the member, the two types of funds differ from one another in a basic area. What will one day emerge from a retirement annuity fund will be entirely the product of the member&#x2019;s own sacrifices during his working life, whereas in the case of a pension fund the annuity payable on retirement is usually the product of the employer&#x2019;s contributions as well as those of the members. In many cases the employer&#x2019;s contributions are very generous, far exceeding those of the employees. In these circumstances we think we are justified in maintaining this distinction which has applied ever since retirement annuity funds were first recognized for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>I may add here that the amendments made in terms of clauses 17 and 18 to the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act are directly linked with the amendment being made in terms of clause 8 to section 11 of the Act.</p>
<p>I shall deal next with the amendments introduced by clauses 10 and 11. The Income Tax Act contains provisions which are designed to encourage the building up and maintenance of a South African merchant fleet consisting of first-class vessels. In a nutshell, the shipowner is permitted to write off 40% of the cost of a ship in the year of purchase and the balance of 60% in six equal annual instalments of 10% each. Details of the types of vessels which qualify for these allowances are given in the White Paper or explanatory memorandum. It has been pointed out recently that whereas a coasting vessel of as little as 200 gross register tons so qualifies, a fishing trawler does not unless its tonnage exceeds one thousand. This may have been a reasonable distinction to make twenty years ago, but times have changed. Trawlers have tended to become smaller, but because of modern equipment and the installation of powerful machinery they are much more efficient than their much larger sisters used to be. Because of these developments, and not only because of inflation, the cost of building a modern trawler has risen astronomically. I consider that there is ample justification for reducing the qualifying tonnage of a fishing vessel from one thousand to two hundred gross register tons.</p>
<p>The amendment made in terms of clause 10 to section 12 of the principal Act merely ensures that, where a factory trawler qualifies for the special shipping allowance under section 14 of the Act, the machinery initial allowance granted in terms of section 12 of the Act will not be allowed in respect of that portion of the cost of the trawler as relates to the processing machinery or plant built into the trawler.</p>
<p>Clause 13 amends section 24B of the principal Act. That section was introduced last year and deals with gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions. In drafting the amendments we have had regard to the helpful advice given to us by professional associations and to the commentaries which have appeared in certain taxation and other publications. While it would be too much to hope that we have satisfied every critic, we have, I think, gone a long way in that direction. Further attention will be given to the section when circumstances permit and, if necessary, further amendments will be proposed in due course.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators will be aware that, as the law now reads, section 24B does not apply if a forward exchange contract was available to the taxpayer and he failed to make use of the facility. When the section was introduced last year, such contracts were available only in respect of a limited range of transactions, and the inclusion of this condition was intended as a sort of carrot and stick to encourage businessmen to take out forward cover where it was in fact available. Since that time the De Kock Commission has reported and one of the results of its labours is that forward exchange contracts are now available in a wide variety of circumstances. Since it was never intended that section 24B should be virtually a dead letter&#x2014;in fact our intentions were exactly the opposite&#x2014;we have reviewed the position and decided to remove this particular condition with retrospective effect.</p>
<p>Section 64C of the principal Act provides for exemptions from the non-resident&#x2019;s tax on interest and hon. Senators will have noticed that, in terms of the third amendment introduced by clause 14, I am taking power, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister of Community Development to exempt from the tax interest on foreign loans raised for housing or community development schemes in the Republic. The provision of suitable housing to meet the needs of our growing population is a matter of the greatest moment and I think it will be agreed that the sacrifice of a limited amount of revenue in order to reduce the cost of that housing to some extent and at the same time to attract funds from abroad for this purpose, is a small price to pay.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the nature of the amendments to be made by clause 15 to section 83 of the principal Act is apparent from what is said in the explanatory memorandum. I think, however, that a few additional words of explanation are called for. As far as is possible, judgments or decisions of the Income Tax Special Courts are published for general information. In terms of the regulations framed under the Income Tax Act, however, publication of any such judgment or decision is subject to the consent of the appellant. Now it sometimes happens that an appellant, for reasons known to himself, declines to allow a judgment to be published, even though his identity is concealed. This is indeed a pity, and it is felt that valuable decisions should no longer be capable of being withheld from the public at the whim of the taxpayer. The proposed amendments will enable the President of the Court who is a judge of the Supreme Court, to overrule the appellant in certain circumstances. The anonymity of the appellant will be fully preserved, just as has been the case in the past.</p>
<p>The amendment introduced by clause 16 to the First Schedule to the principal Act follows from an announcement made in my Budget Speech that farmers who have elected the system of equalized tax rates (&#x201C;nivellering&#x201D; in Afrikaans) will henceforth be taxed at the lower of the equalized rate or their rate of tax for the year in accordance with the normal rules. This represents an extremely generous concession to farmers and should be of particular benefit to those who have suffered as a result of the recent drought.</p>
<p>Under the pay-as-you-earn system of tax collection the threshold at which provisional tax becomes payable has for many years stood at R500. The amendment effected by clause 19 will raise that threshold to R1 000 and enable the Secretary for Inland Revenue to remove the names of some 210 000 persons from the register of provisional taxpayers. Not only will this result in a measurable saving in costs, but it will also save a large number of elderly persons the trouble of estimating their income twice every year and every six months making a journey to the local revenue office in order to pay their provisional tax. This does not, however, mean a sacrifice of revenue but rather a deferment as the tax will be collected when an assessment is issued.</p>
<p>I am sorry, Mr. President, that what I intended to be relatively brief remarks on this Bill have tended to become somewhat extended. There are, however, one or two further matters which I wish to touch on briefly before I close.</p>
<p>In my budget speech I referred to the matter of fringe benefits and stated that a report on the subject was expected soon. That report has since been submitted to me and arrangements are being made for it to be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> during the latter part of July so that the public will have a full opportunity to study the proposals and submit their comments. It is disturbing to note that, in spite of my budget statement, reports have appeared in various newspapers and periodicals which suggest that a massive witch-hunt is about to be set afoot and insinuate that civil servants receive valuable tax-free prerequisites which will continue to go untaxed. Those reports, Mr. President, contain some truths, some half-truths and some untruths which are twisted in such a way as to create the impression that civil servants and members of the Senate are an elite class who are growing fat at the expense of the general public. If the writers of these misleading and damaging articles would take the trouble to examine the facts and compare them fairly with what is enjoyed by persons in the private sector, they would be forced to change their tune. In any event, it will soon be seen that the report on the taxation of fringe benefits goes out of its way to ensure equality of treatment between the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Finally, in regard to the matter of a capital gains tax, the situation seems to have been reached where the introduction of such a tax is regarded in certain quarters as inevitable. Such, Mr. President, is certainly not the case. A draft Bill will be published for general information during the recess, and in the light of the comments received from all quarters a decision one way or the other will be taken. In the meantime the Government is in no way committed to the introduction of such a tax.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I commend the Bill to the Senate.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the latter part of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech is very interesting in view of his budget proposals in regard to a fringe benefit and capital gains tax. I cannot comment on this as we have not seen the draft Bill or know very little about its contents or what is proposed, but I would again appeal to the hon. the Minister to be very lenient in the drawing up of the provisions of this draft Bill. I believe that under our present economic conditions, with a tax on capital gains and also on fringe benefits we might find ourselves in a position where it could possibly mean retarding the rate of growth that we are so anxious to achieve.</p>
<p>There are considerable concessions in the Bill before us. There is a concession to the shipping industry, for instance. I can see the purpose of these concessions and on behalf of the recipients I want to express my appreciation. But I must admit that I know very little about shipping and that is therefore the most I can do.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister must not think that in my part of the world we do not have sea or waves. In the Kalahari we have a sea of sand, and the dunes are our waves, but unfortunately we use camels for ships and not the type of craft that is used on the ocean.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, the relief in respect of the income tax margins is something which this side of the House has been requesting for a long time, but what was particularly encouraging in the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister was that the lowering of the margins is not merely a fiscal measure but is in fact part of a new tax reform system which we are introducing in the Republic. Consequently I think it gives a reasonable degree of permanence to lower tax scales in our tax structure and also holds out the prospect of further reductions in tax rates, as circumstances allow.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister also expressed the hope that tax forms would in future be returned sooner as a result of these concessions. I readily concede that in the case of salary earners and pensioners it is probably not very difficult to fill in a tax form and send it back. But the preparation, auditing and drawing up of balance sheets is not such an easy task. At that time of the year there is nothing one can do to get one&#x2019;s accountants to work faster since they usually have so much work that they cannot give preference to a particularsk. Consequently I am afraid that the hon. the Minister and his department will have to go on being patient with these people. I do not think there is anyone who deliberately wants to delay the handing inof an income tax form, but even to the ordinary farmers these forms have become so complicated that they have to rely on people with more knowledge in this respect, who will hand in the forms in their own good time.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I now wish to express a few ideas on pension funds. In my view the hon. the Minister would not harm the economy in any way if he were to add a further R500 to the existing figure of R3 500 as far as retirement annuity funds are concerned. The amount of R23 000 which the hon. the Minister mentioned here, and the accompanying deduction of R3 500 for retirement funds sounds reasonable, but I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that many persons use this kind of fund as a way of saving and also as a hedge against penury in their old age. If one is able to make this minor concession of an additional R500 per annum I think these funds are also a means of saving and a source from which the State, as in the past, could obtain loans in times when capital is not very readily available. In my opinion saving should be encouraged in every country in the world and in every sphere. I would therefore be grateful if the hon. the Minister would take this suggestion into consideration in his next budget.</p>
<p>I now wish to refer to the reports of the special courts. I believe that these reports of the special courts, or rather the judgments given by the special income tax court, should as far as possible be made known to interested persons and to persons involved in the drawing up and completion of income tax forms. In spite of the concessions which the hon. the Minister wishes to effect by way of an amendment in this Bill I do not think that these concessions go far enough. We on this side of the House believe that there will be many people who will not see much sense in granting their permission for the publication of the evidence and the findings in such cases. It is merely a natural and human characteristic, for why should they grant their permission if the case is over and judgment has been given? There is no encouraging reason for them to grant their permission for the publication of these judgments. I wish to suggest&#x2014;the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper gives effect to this&#x2014;that one should try instead to apply the provision in a different way, i.e. by allowing 30 days in which an appellant may object to the publishing of the findings and the judgment. If he has not objected within a period of 30 days then they may be published.</p>
<p>With these few words we on this side of the House support the Bill. I wish to express the hope that the tax reforms envisaged by the hon. the Minister will have reached such an advanced stage next year that he will be able to announce further reductions in the tax rates to us.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I wish to thank the Opposition for supporting this Bill. The hon. Senator Swanepoel was quite right in pointing out that this Bill forms part of the tax reform programme. The hon. the Minister said the same thing, and I think it is right that we should consider it in that light.</p>
<p>†When the general sales tax was introduced about a year ago a fair amount of apprehension existed, in particular on the part of the opposition, about its success, the wisdom of it, about the scope of it and about its effects. I think it is the view of all of us&#x2014; there is no sense in the Government trying to score a debating point at this particular stage and I do not think we are trying to do so&#x2014; that the introduction of the general sales tax, its effects and the benefits we are in fact perceiving this afternoon, are a credit and a monument to the hon. the Minister of Finance. I think few people realize the number of administrative difficulties that accompanied the introduction of this massive programme, a programme which not only involved a new concept but which also required a great deal of administrative know-how and dedication on the part of the staff.</p>

<p>We will be dealing with the Sales Tax Amendment Bill tomorrow.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#poorter">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>Seeing that we are dealing with the Income Tax Bill and that general sales tax forms a part of taxation, I think it is quite appropriate that I should refer to it. I also think the explanatory memorandum accompanying this Bill is a very comprehensive one and is one which we on this side of the House have welcomed very much.</p>
<p>Something which has not yet been mentioned, but which I would like to refer to, is the question of the classification of somebody who is in fact making a contribution as supporting a dependant. We are now raising the amount required to qualify as a deduction from income from R1 200 to R2 400 per year. In the light of the diminishing value of money I think this is to be welcomed. On the other hand, abatement allowances have been increased. This is a compensatory factor because we are now reducing the diminution abatement rate to about half of what it was previously. In the past the abatement rates diminished by R2 per R1 000 (for a certain income and more) whereas it will now be R1 per R1 000. The new Treasury bonds with an interest rate of 7% still give us a tax-free investment up to an amount of R40 000. Something which might interest the hon. Senator Koch is that the deductible amount from a wife&#x2019;s earnings has been increased from R750 to R900 per annum.</p>
<p>With the change of accent as regards the levying of taxes, I think we can look forward to many reforms in the future. It may be that what the hon. Senator Swanepoel has just asked for may become a reality in a year or two&#x2019;s time. The hon. the Minister is continually looking for ways and means of ensuring that we are not going to act punitively towards the producer. I think the hon. the Minister has achieved this aim with these tax proposals. We on this side of the House wish to congratulate him on this and we support the Bill wholeheartedly.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#rensburg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, there is something which is not quite clear to me and if the hon. the Minister is unable to help me now, it is something which I could eventually clear up with the department. Section ll(l)(iv), which is being inserted by clause 8, provides that as far as a partnership is concerned, its members will be deemed to be one person for the purposes of the paragraph. This provision is not clear to me, and I would be pleased if the hon. the Minister could possibly throw more light on it.</p>
<p>I should also like to say a few words about clause 15. The legal profession really welcomes this provision. Some of our most important legal judgments are on the question of income tax. I, myself, have dealt with cases where the income tax court gave a decision on a certain legal point which the appeal court subsequently amended. At present Butterworth is one of the largest publishers of legal decisions. I wonder whether an arrangement cannot be made with them to publish legal principles&#x2014;not all the facts, nor any identification of the persons involved&#x2014;separately. It would serve as a good reference work for everyone.</p>
<p>I should also like to say something about capital gains tax. This question is not under discussion now, but the hon. the Minister referred to it. I trust that the question of inflation will be borne in mind in the consideration of this matter. The hon. Senator Oelrich, in a previous debate, pointed out quite correctly that a rand which had been worth a 100c 10 years ago, was worth 15c today. When we calculate our profits on sales today, taking into consideration the interest rates which we have paid over the years, we realize that what may appear to be a profit today could very well be a loss.</p>
<p>We know of the case, approximately three decades ago, when the late Minister Hofmeyr introduced gains tax on immovable property. It created so much work and so many problems that after three or four years the tax was eventually dropped. When it was calculated on a single asset only, such as immovable property, it was found that it was impractical. I am mentioning this in all humility, Mr. President, for once the Bill is here, it may create more problems than if we were to express a few reservations about it before the time. Consequently I just want to emphasize the question of the tremendous inflation, and point out that what may initially appear to be a profit may in reality be a loss if we take everything into consideration which we have spent in that connection in the course of time.</p>

<speech by="#koch">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. J. KOCH</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I think I must make some contribution to this debate in regard to what the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter has said. I wish to thank the hon. the Minister for increasing the allowance for married women, but I must tell him that women are beginning to feel rather like that old song: &#x201C;How ya gonna keep &#x2019;em down on the farm, after they&#x2019;ve seen Paree.&#x201D; Unfortunately, we all see and we all read what is going on in the rest of the world, and we rather feel that we are getting a raw deal. We appreciate everything about the men in this country, except one thing, and that is that when it comes to money they like to keep us short of it. Girls feel a kiss on the hand may be all very well but a diamond bracelet lasts for ever. I should like to give Senator Horwood a kiss on the hand for increasing the allowance, but we just feel we should get what everybody else is getting. At the risk of being a bore I want to read what has been written in this connection&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">People are available and have the brain power to fill top and middle management but only 15% of our population is suitable for this and more than half of these are women.

<p>No, not Adele van der Spuy; I am not going into competition with her! We know that the hon. Senator Van Schoor has a very soft spot for her, so maybe he will also understand how women can sometimes be driven mad with frustration. [Interjections.] I know that his idea is to get a woman in the Transvaal into Parliament and we all know which woman he has in mind. But if you do not give the women some incentive to come back to work they will stay at home even Adele. We do not want a repetition of what happened with petrol but we are going to make a heck of a demand when you need us. We therefore ask the hon. the Minister of Finance to reconsider our case and to remember too that we are going to be there, but that we cannot be there successfully unless you make it possible for us to be there now.</p>
<p>For a long time I have also wanted to put in a word for pensions for our husbands, but as the hon. Senator Horak does that on every possible occasion, and because he is a great defender of the poor and of women and orphans, I think I can leave that matter safely to him and to Mrs. Suzman in the Other Place. Meanwhile I am speaking in clichés this afternoon, and in platitudes, and perhaps I do sound a bit like a Cassandra because I bring this future woman shortage up on every occasion. However, I am even becoming frightened of one thing, something the hon. Senator Carr once said to me while I was aggressively crossing a street&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. President, I should like to thank hon. Senators on both sides of the House for their support of this measure which I think everyone will agree is a very important one. In the first place, I wish to reply to a matter raised by the hon. Senator Swanepoel. He suggested that we should perhaps increase the amount in the case of annuity funds from R3 500 to R4 000; this is of course a further concession, but I shall give thorough consideration to it. I shall discuss the matter with my senior officials and we could perhaps look into the matter early next year. There will probably be no motion of censure by that time, because we are now a very good Government and there will probably have to be another debate &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>We shall come back to this point, and I shall give it thorough attention. I agree with the hon. Senator Swanepoel that this is a very important form of saving. There is no doubt about that, it is becoming increasingly important in our economy, and we must bear it in mind.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel also referred to clause 15 in connection with the publication of decisions of the special court. I want to thank him for the amendments which he moved, and for his interest in this matter. I think his amendments are aimed at reducing the administrative work in connection with the publication of court decisions, but there are certain practical problems. He must not think now that we are ostensibly refusing any amendment; that is not so, but I want to try to elucidate the situation as we see it a little further. There are one or two problems in connection with these amendments. In the first place, in terms of regulation B.15 which is being deleted by subsection (2), decisions are only published with the express consent of the appellant and I hesitate to depart from this principle, except in cases where the appellant withholds his consent unreasonably. Secondly, according to the wording as moved by the hon. Senator, the Registrar will accept, if the appellant does not react to his notice, that there is no objection and proceed to have the decision published. However, that may not be the case either. The appellant may not have received the notice. Of course, this situation could also arise in terms of the wording which I have proposed, but in the latter case the anonymity of the appellant will be preserved in that publication will only take place on the authorization of the president of the court, and not automatically, as would be the case in terms of the amendment moved by the hon. Senator, as I understand it.</p>

<p>For these reasons, although I feel that the proposed amendments are to a large extent reasonable ones, I would appreciate it if I could be given a little more time to go into the implications of this amendment thoroughly, and perhaps consult the hon. Senator about it again at a later stage. This is in fact the position as I see it at the moment.</p>
<p>†Then, Mr. President, the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter seems to have been under the impression that the abatement for a dependant has been increased from R1 200 to R2 400. I am not quite sure if I understood him correctly, but let me say that if my understanding of his point is correct &#x2026;</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#poorter">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>On a point of explanation, Mr. President, I meant that a dependant is regarded as one for whom one makes a contribution of R2 400 a year, not R1 200.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I shall leave it at that then. I am sorry if I did not hear him correctly.</p>
<p>*The hon. Senator Van Rensburg raised one or two interesting points. He asked why a partnership is regarded as one person. The amendment relates to the contributions which an employer makes to pension funds. The maximum contribution which is normally allowed, and this may of course be increased, is an amount equal to 10% of the employee&#x2019;s remuneration. Where the employee is in partnership consisting of, say, four persons, they are jointly allowed to contribute one amount of 10%, and not four times 10%. I hope this is clear. I want to thank him for his contribution.</p>
<p>The other point which the hon. Senator mentioned was the importance of bearing in mind the question of inflation, particularly what it could really mean in regard to profits; in other words, the nominal amount and the real amount. In the case of a high inflation rate this of course makes a vast difference. We shall go into the aspects which the hon. Senator mentioned very thoroughly.</p>
<p>†I should like to thank the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter for his support of this measure.</p>
<p>Finally, the hon. Senator Koch referred to the increase in the deduction for married women from R750 to R900. I cannot say that it is an epoch-making amount, as some of our friends on the Continent like to say, but it is an improvement in the right direction. If I understood her correctly, she said that she might even kiss my hand for that!</p>

<p>What about a diamond bracelet?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I think what is actually more important here is that the marginal rate of tax has been reduced. It is now 55% at the top. I think that is more significant for all taxpayers and quite clearly also for married women. That is much more important and if we can succeed&#x2014;this is my serious aim at any rate and I hope I shall succeed&#x2014;in reducing that still further, then the constructive effect of that on the position of married women will be very clearly seen.</p>
<p>As far as the general tax position is concerned, I am sure the hon. Senator Koch will bear in mind that we have also made a substantial concession in the form of a more gradual diminution in the abatements above R5 000 over the whole spectrum. I think that will make a very big difference. The amount that the Treasury loses in that respect alone in one year is about R200 million so that will not be insignificant for many taxpayers. All these concessions taken together will mean a considerable benefit not only to the general taxpayer but certainly also to married women.</p>
<p>I think we have also made fairly important improvements in the position of divorced and separated women who have dependants. The tax position has definitely been improved in their case as well.</p>
<p>Mr. President, we try to improve the position from year to year and all being well, we shall see with what we can come up with next year. I fully appreciate the hon. Senator Koch&#x2019;s concern for the position of married women because I think their position needs to be constantly borne in mind. I can assure the hon. Senator that this is something that the Commission on Taxation Policy is constantly considering. The fact that they did this two or three years ago and brought out a very carefully worded report in conjunction with the Department of Inland Revenue does not mean that they have simply left the matter at that. They are constantly reviewing the position. But if the hon. Senator were to. ask me what my first priority is, I would say that it is to bring down the marginal rate of tax for all taxpayers just as much as we can. Once we have achieved something in that respect which we feel is really significant, we can have another look at the specific problems of married women and their taxation.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I thank the hon. the Minister for his assurance that he will reconsider my amendment during the recess. He will probably then have more time to have a closer look at it and to obtain further considered opinion on it. I realize that all of us are very busy at this stage of the session and that there is precious little time to look at amendments of this kind. The hon. the Minister will however realize that these Bills come to us at a very late stage of the session and there is nothing that we as an Opposition can do about it. We cannot do anything about getting the Bills earlier and thus being able to bring certain amendments to the notice of the hon. the Minister. When it comes to the question of putting amendments on the Order Paper, I do not think we can put amendments on the Order Paper before a Bill has had its First Reading in the House, so the position is very difficult.</p>
<p>I think the hon. the Minister will see the good sense in that amendment of mine when he has another look at it. I think it has a great deal of merit. The hon. the Minister has mentioned certain objections at this stage. We could have a lengthy discussion on those but I do not think that would serve any purpose at this stage of the session.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Koch, in reference to the R900 now deductible from the combined income of a husband and wife, asked for a greater concession in that regard and I think there is merit in her request. She said something else as well which made me realize that men are sometimes foolish but when she said that men were sometimes stingy when it came to handing money over to their wives, I thought that men were sensible people. I do not know how women spend the money. I remember in the olden days when the husbands received their pay-packets they handed those pay-packets over to their wives and the wives gave them a certain allowance. That is not done any more these days.</p>
<p>Talking about women&#x2019;s lib, I think there is a certain amount of men&#x2019;s lib as well these days due to the fact that we control our own finances. I would, however, commend to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention this question of working women. It is something that worries us greatly. I realize what the consequences to the Treasury will be if greater concessions are made but the hon. the Minister will also realize what effect this has on productivity, viz. the keeping away of people in the higher income brackets from the labour market. They are as a rule better trained; they are a more specialized type; they are the people we really want to be active in our economy. With these few words, Sir, I support the Third Reading.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the hon. Opposition for the fact that I have been able to introduce this Bill now at such very short notice.</p>
<p>Mr. President, it would not be realistic to assume that the attainment of political independence by Venda will automatically lead to financial independence for that country in the foreseeable future. Venda still finds itself in the position which is characteristic of developing countries. There has been little development in the secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy of Venda, and the contribution made by agriculture, forestry, fisheries and hunting to the gross domestic product of Venda at present still amounts to more than 30%. Moreover, by far the greater part of this contribution comes from the self-supporting sector, i.e. the sector which does not enter the market. As in the case of other developing countries, the paucity of economic activity in Venda is a factor which inhibits the generation of State revenue. It is therefore obvious that Venda will continue to need the financial support of South Africa after it has become independent.</p>
<p>It is essential to take a realistic view of the situation of Venda. In an article published by the Africa Institute of South Africa earlier this year, reference was made to the views of the Morse Commission, which reported in 1959 upon the economic requirements of the former High Commission Territories, i.e. the present Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. That commission proceeded from the standpoint that viability did not necessarily imply that a particular country should be able to manage without any financial aid from abroad. However, it does mean that the State concerned should at least be able to finance its current expenditure itself.</p>
<p>The Africa Institute pointed out that in terms of this standard Venda could not yet be regarded as viable. This was also the finding of the institute in respect of another principle which is relevant in determining viability, i.e. that a viable State should be able to provide job opportunities for the greater part of its adult labour force.</p>
<p>In our consultations about the question of the provision of financial aid to Venda in the future I believe we should be very mindful of these arguments. However, I would like to refer to a few matters in this connection.</p>
<p>As far as the question of job opportunities is concerned, it is true that a considerable number of Venda men are still working outside Venda. However, a similar phenomenon is found in other countries which have already attained political independence. In fact, a good example of this is presented by the former High Commission Territories. It is also interesting to note in this connection that the percentage of the Venda population living permanently in that country has increased since 1970 and amounted to approximately 70% in 1977. Although this tendency does not necessarily imply any significant developments in respect of employment in Venda, it does indicate stability as far as the occupation of the country is concerned.</p>
<p>During the period from 1971-&#x2019;72 to 1978-&#x2019;79, Venda&#x2019;s own revenue, expressed as a percentage of its total budget, increased by more than 150%. Unfortunately, not enough information is available at the moment to separate Venda&#x2019;s current government expenditure from capital expenditure. However, it goes without saying that the encouraging tendency to which I have just referred would be even more striking if Venda&#x2019;s own revenue could be compared with current expenditure only.</p>
<p>There is a further factor which has to be borne in mind. The principle has already been accepted that amounts should be transferred to the Black States equal to the indirect taxes arising from the economic activities in those States. Because of insufficient statistical data, it has not yet been possible to calculate exactly what is due to Venda in respect of customs duties, for example. As a result, only nominal amounts have been transferred to Venda in this connection in the past. However, the necessary surveys are now being made and the position will change considerably after Venda has become independent, when its share of the joint revenue pool of the customs union will be determined on exactly the same basis as those of the other countries to which the customs union arrangements are applicable. Although it is too early to make any projections in this connection, the new developments can be expected to lead to a perceptible increase in Venda&#x2019;s revenue from these sources.</p>
<p>With these remarks I have tried to illustrate the positive aspects. However, as I indicated at the very beginning of my speech, there is no doubt about the fact that once Venda has become independent South Africa will have to give financial aid to this new neighbouring State. It is the intention to give this aid in a way that will enable Venda to build the necessary stability into its public finances and to face the future with confidence.</p>
<p>†The arrangements which are proposed, Mr. President, do not differ in any material respect from those made when Transkei and Bophuthatswana attained independence. For the convenience of hon. Senators I would, however, like to refer to each of the various clauses very briefly.</p>
<p>Clause 1(1):</p>
<p>The Black States Constitution Act which at present provides for the transfer of funds to Venda, will cease to apply to that country when it attains independence. The total amount made available for Venda in respect of the 1979-&#x2019;80 financial year, will not yet have been transferred at that stage. Clause 1(1) therefore envisages, firstly, the transfer of the balance of such funds to Venda.</p>
<p>Services which at present are carried out on behalf of Venda by Government departments in the Republic, will become the responsibility of Venda on the date of independence. The relevant departments have budgeted for the full 1979-&#x2019;80 financial year and will accordingly experience a surplus in respect of the period from the attainment of independence by Venda until 31 March 1980. It is intended to transfer such funds to Venda as well.</p>
<p>Clause 1(1) also provides for the transfer to Venda of any further amounts that may be made available in the Additional Appropriation or by way of Ministerial authorization.</p>
<p>Clause 1(2):</p>
<p>As in the case of certain Government departments which have budgeted for a full financial year in respect of services in Venda and will stop incurring expenditure in this connection at the time of independence, there may also be other bodies that will have unutilized funds that can be transferred to Venda. Clause 1(2) aims at authorizing the transfer of such funds.</p>
<p>Clause 1(3):</p>
<p>Taxes paid by citizens of Venda in the Republic, in terms of the Black Taxation Act, are transferred to Venda in terms of the provisions of the Black States Constitution Act. As has been mentioned, when Venda becomes independent, these provisions will cease to be applicable to that country. Clause 1(3) authorizes the transfer to Venda of that portion of such taxes for the 1979-&#x2019;80 financial year which has not been transferred when Venda becomes independent.</p>
<p>Clause 1(4):</p>
<p>Section 7(1) of the Exchequer and Audit Act, in terms of which additional funds&#x2014; hence funds not included in the budget&#x2014;can be made available by the Minister of Finance for the defraying of expenses does, however, also place a limit on the total amount that can thus be made available. Section 7(2) of the Exchequer and Audit Act also provides that steps should be taken for the voting of such additional funds during the Parliamentary session following upon the date on which the funds are made available by the Minister. Clause 1(4) provides that any additional funds made available for Venda by the Minister of Finance in terms of clause 1(1)(d) will also be subject to the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchequer and Audit Act. This means, in other words, that such additional funds for Venda will be included in the total amount which the Minister can make available in terms of section 7(1) of the Exchequer and Audit Act, that is to say 2 per cent of the relevant budget at the time. Such funds then must also be voted.</p>
<p>Clause 2:</p>
<p>Clause 2 relates to financial years after 1979-&#x2019;80. In terms of this clause the necessary sanction is obtained for an agreement with Venda in terms of which the following amounts can be transferred to Venda every year, subject to such conditions and for such periods as the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs may determine:</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) An amount equal to the taxes paid every year by Venda citizens in the Republic in terms of the Black Taxation Act.</li>
<li>(b) An amount determined by the Minister of Finance, but not exceeding the total expenditure of the RSA in, or on behalf of, Venda in the 1979-&#x2019;80 financial year&#x2014;i.e. expenditure by normal Government departments and other bodies, for example, the Railways and the Post Office&#x2014;plus an additional amount which Venda will need, in particular to continue with its new services in the 1980-&#x2019;81 financial year, i.e. a full financial year, minus the additional revenue which Venda will receive in the 1980-&#x2019;81 financial year. Once the total amount at issue here has been determined, it shall remain constant. It shall also represent a statutory amount in future estimates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clause 2 also provides for the transfer to Venda of any additional amount that may be voted for Venda by Parliament in any specific year.</p>
<p>Clause 3:</p>
<p>In this clause provision is made for the transfer of certain assets to Venda.</p>
<p>Clause 4:</p>
<p>It is an accepted principle that assets, in connection with services that become the responsibility of a Black state, are transferred free of charge to the government of such a state. In the case of assets of the Post Office and the Railways and Harbours Administration the intention, however, is to compensate the relevant bodies for assets which are transferred, by reducing the relevant bodies&#x2019; loan debt to the Treasury.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the House is grateful to the hon. the Minister for the way in which he has explained the provisions of this Bill. He has done so in detail and we appreciate it.</p>
<p>I do not wish to quarrel with the hon. the Minister about this Bill. The big battle will take place tomorrow or the day after when we discuss the Status of Venda Bill, for this is where the differences in principle lie. My only complaint is that the hon. the Minister is actually putting the cart before the horse by introducing this Bill before the Status of Venda Bill because the hon. the Minister is now guilty of assuming that this hon. House will approve the Status of Venda Bill. This, however, is a theoretical view which I have and I shall not elaborate further upon it.</p>
<p>It will of course be necessary for the Republic of South Africa to continue the financial support given to this homeland in the past. There is no argument about that, and we approve of this for various reasons. One of the reasons is that if we do not do so, someone else will do so, and it could be an enemy of the Republic. I will not elaborate on that either as we can discuss all those matters when the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s colleague comes here.</p>
<p>†In fact, Sir, this to a very large extent is consequential legislation. We do not have the first legislation in this regard, but this Bill is consequential upon the other Bill being passed. We will therefore have no objection to the passing of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House are of the opinion that the regulations contained in this Bill are consistent with those in legislation of a similar nature that was passed previously. It is aimed at regulating the smooth change-over of Venda to an independent state and, as the hon. Senator Horak said, that principle is not to be discussed this afternoon, certainly not by me. This side of the House therefore supports this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am in some difficulty now because my party is opposed to the Status of Venda Bill which we have not yet had before us. The hon. Senator Horak said this is putting the cart before the horse, and I can understand that at the end of the session technical problems do arise. I want however to put this question to the hon. the Minister, and I ask it out of ignorance. Can we in fact constitutionally pass a measure of this sort in the House? In other words, can we dispose of property, can we dispose of money to something which in fact does not yet exist?</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, on a point of order: The hon. Senator is debating an incorrect point. He is assuming that we are giving something away, whereas the Bill clearly states that it will be &#x201C;on independence&#x201D;.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator makes my point better than I could make it myself. That is exactly the point. We are being asked to agree to the South African Government donating, selling or disposing of property or money to something which in fact does not exist at this particular point in time. [Interjections.] With the best will in the world, how can I do that?</p>
<p>Mr. President, if the Bills had come in the proper order, the other way around, I would have argued and voted against the Status of Venda Bill because I do not agree with it. But after having voted against the Status of Venda Bill, when the hon. the Minister introduced the Financial Arrangements with Venda Bill I would have had to take a different attitude because the first Bill would have been passed and it would be no good arguing against the second Bill because then they would have no funds to meet their commitments. In other words, Sir, my attitude would have been that I would have supported the Bill before us, that is the Financial Arrangements with Venda Bill, having lost&#x2014;as I assume that I am going to lose it&#x2014;my argument on the Status of Venda Bill.</p>
<p>I am quite certain that the hon. the Minister can understand my point of view if some of the hon. Senators on the other side cannot. How can I support a Bill in which something is to be disposed of to a body that does not exist? It is as simple as that.</p>
<p>But, Sir, I want to ask you on a point of order whether it is in fact constitutional that this Bill can be passed in this manner. I should like ruling on this matter because I do not believe that it is in fact constitutional that it can be done in this way. I know that if this had been arranged differently we would have had the other Bill first, and then I would have been in a different position. But, Sir, all I can ask for is your guidance on whether it is constitutional that this Bill should be dis cussed in this way. I am going to vote against this Bill. [Interjections.] I do not know whether hon. Senators on the other side are blind, Sir. Are they just a charitable institution? Are they prepared to give chunks of South Africa away without any legislation? This is what it amounts to.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I should like your guidance in this matter. In my humble way I believe that this is in fact unconstitutional. The hon. the Minister of Finance cannot do it this way. He cannot give away pieces of South Africa without the necessary Bill before us.</p>

<p>†I do not think there is a constitutional problem. First of all, Venda is a self-governing territory. Secondly, the short title of the Bill states that &#x201C;This Act shall be called the Financial Arrangements with Venda Act, 1979, and shall come into operation on the date of commencement of the Status of Venda Act, 1979&#x201D;.

<p>*Mr. President, this motion is being moved to give effect to a unanimous decision of the Committee on Standing Orders of 14 June this year. As will be seen from the motion, it has been decided that the practice of proroguing Parliament at the end of a session will no longer apply, but that the Senate and the House of Assembly will be adjourned until the date on which it is intended to commence the following session. Parliament will then be prorogued on the day prior to the date to which the two Houses stand adjourned. The main object of this new procedure, of course, is to enable select committees to sit during the recess, a need which has long been felt. I wish to point out that this new procedure does not exclude the possibility that to facilitate the work of a select committee the State President may appoint members of a select committee as a commission to proceed with the work of the select committee or certain aspects thereof. For various reasons select committees must sit in the Houses of Parliament in Cape Town, and in cases where a select committee wishes to sit elsewhere, it will be reconstituted as a commission.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>We are dealing here today with one of our smaller national groups, but at the same time a national group which distinguishes itself very clearly from the other Black nations of South Africa. From what could be established about the early history of the present nation of Venda, it appears that the last immigrants crossed the Limpopo River long before 1700 and settled in the Nzhelele Valley in the vicinity of the Soutpansberg. According to tradition they encountered a local population there called Vhangona, and their descendants still form part of the population of Venda today.</p>
<p>The important groups which entered the country, such as Tshivhula, Ndou, Dau and finally Singo are still distinguishable today. For interest&#x2019;s sake it can be mentioned that it was the latter group that built a capital with stone walls&#x2014;Dzata&#x2014;in the Nzhelele Valley and expanded the empire of Thovhele to cover a wide area.</p>
<p>Since the earliest times the nation of Venda has been acknowledged as a tightly-knit ethnic unit occupying a small definable area and sharing a great deal of common history, a particular culture and a language&#x2014;Tshi-venda&#x2014;of remarkable uniformity. This language is a very important part of the Venda identity. It is no dialect, but a language in its own right and incomprehensible to its neighbours. Anyone who does not speak this language is not really regarded as one of the people.</p>
<p>The Venda are still living today where their forefathers have lived for centuries. As a nation, the Venda never emigrated from their present territory, while other groups did immigrate to Venda and were assimilated into the nation. This nation, as a result of the dry area along the Limpopo and the tsetse fly-infested South-East, remained in isolation to a great degree. Many aspects of the Venda culture, such as social structure and family organization, marriage, inheritance and property ownership, origin in totem groups, agricultural calender and methods, plants cultivated, clothing and other things, especially when seen as a unit, are so unique as to be clearly distinguishable from the culture of other South African ethnic groups.</p>
<p>†Venda has always consisted of a number of independent chieftainships and its political situation was rather exceptional for Southern Africa. In Venda there are no tribes in the usual sense where the nation and their ruler form a unit. Here the ruling clan and its territory form a unit, with the commoners forming the movable part. The ruler rules by virtue of inheritance and if a ruler loses his land, he loses everything, including his right to rule.</p>
<p>No review of Venda history, however concise it may be, is truly complete without mentioning the considerable influence of Joao Albasini (Tshiwawa), a Portuguese trader and agent of the Transvaal Republic, who in his capacity as Commissioner for Natives made use of armed Tsonga refugees from Mozambique, to maintain law and order in the area, to combat faction fights and to collect taxes imposed by him on tribesmen in the area. A considerable number of these refugees settled along the south side of the Zoutpansberg under Venda chiefs, whose rule they accepted. That concludes the past history of Venda. Politically, Venda developed rapidly in the recent past, by accepting the status of a territorial authority in 1962, the establishment of a legislative assembly during 1971 and the declaration as a self-governing territory in 1973, and today we are dealing with the instrument which shall enable Venda to advance as a fully independent state.</p>
<p>On an occasion of this nature it may well be appropriate to view the State in its present form in different fields in an effort to determine the State&#x2019;s ability to adapt and to fit into the commonwealth of nations and to have a glimpse into the future. In contrast with other Black States in the Republic, Venda has an exceptionally high percentage, namely 68% of its <i>de jure</i> population living within its boundaries and, in addition to that, the Government of Venda is desirous, not only to recognize its people as citizens, but especially to resettle those living in the rural areas, in Venda.</p>
<p>*It is worth mentioning that in the economic field, Venda maintained an annual average growth rate of 25,9% in its gross domestic product in the years from 1970 to 1975 and that the share of Blacks in that product was already 90% in 1975. The national per capita income is R228 per annum, and this income increased over the years mentioned above by an annual average of 18,8%. Venda is primarily an agricultural area which also has a very high potential in certain areas for the cultivation of coffee and tea.</p>
<p>Up to the present, mining has not played a major role in the economy of Venda, but with the recent discoveries of large coal deposits, this potential, too, has increased considerably. As regards area and population, Venda is a small State, but for the sake of perspective it may be mentioned that a comparison with 28 other small countries&#x2014;10 in Africa and six each in America, Asia and Oceania&#x2014;shows that Venda covers a larger area than 15 of those countries and has a larger population than 17 of them, while it has a lower population density than 18.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that Venda had a higher per capita income in 1975 than 28 African States and that its real per capita income maintained an average growth rate higher than that of 45 African States. It is also of interest to know that while African States receive an average of R 17,80 per capita of development aid, Venda receives R49,22.</p>
<p>As far as the assets of Venda are concerned, all that remains is to discuss the most important asset of the country, i.e. its people. From 1970 to 1977 the number of schools in Venda increased by 40,5% and the number of pupils by 60%, while the pupil-teacher ratio dropped by 30%. During this period the number of post-primary pupils, as a percentage of primary and post-primary pupils, increased with 250% and Venda university students increased by 50%.</p>
<p>From these facts one can only conclude that a promising future awaits a nation that looks after its youth in this manner. I take pleasure in wishing Venda the grace of God for their future, and I do so with full confidence.</p>

<p>The hon. Senator must just give me an opportunity to see him for the Chair on which I am sitting is still a little new and, what is more, it creaks.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, with regard to what you have just said, on behalf of this side of the House I want to welcome you back in the Chair to which you were duly elected by this House. I also want to wish you a speedy and complete recovery.</p>
<p>In the second place I want to welcome the hon. the Minister and congratulate him on his promotion to full Minister. I am not quite sure in which capacity he is appearing here this morning. It seems to me that he has not as yet relinquished his former office of Deputy Minister; he is still temporarily in that capacity although he is now a full Minister. However, we want to congratulate him on his promotion and wish him everything of the best. A philosopher of old said that there is nothing new under the sun. The truth of that statement is reaffirmed by this debate which is taking place here this morning. This is now the third chapter in the long story of big apartheid, a story which started in 1959 with the announcement of the new policy by the late Dr. Verwoerd in the Other Place.</p>
<p>†Twenty years is a long time and we now have the third instalment, the third chapter of the story of big apartheid over that period. I must say the process has been very slow indeed, because we still have several other homelands with which to deal in terms of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Government&#x2019;s policy. The arguments which were used in 1959 on both sides, for and against, are the same arguments which can be used and will be used again today. Because that is so and because there is nothing new under the sun, Mr. President, I am not going to detain this House very long. I could very easily read the speech I made on the Status of the Transkei Bill, or the speech I made on the Status of Bophuthatswana Bill, and there would be very little change necessary in what I said then with regard to what I am about to say now. As I say, I do not want to repeat old arguments which have been thrown across the floor of the House from both sides for many, many years, in fact for 20 years. However, I do want to say one or two things.</p>
<p>Before I do so, I want to thank the hon. the Minister for his interesting exposition of the history of the Venda people. They are a very interesting people as the hon. the Minister has said. They are almost unique, in fact, in Africa and in Southern Africa with regard to their background. Their language is very beautiful, not that I understand it but I have heard it spoken because I know that part of the world quite well. It is a beautiful language. Their culture is in fact a unique culture in many respects and they are an interesting people. Therefore, particularly because they are a peace-loving, interesting, docile people, we as their White rulers at this stage, should be very careful about the manner in which we deal with them. We must be quite sure that anything we do is in their long-term interests. That is why I think we should consider this Bill a little more carefully than we had perhaps intended to do earlier.</p>
<p>Of course, this Bill emphasizes the basic difference in principle between the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Government and my party with regard to this question of the future of the homelands. I have said before and I say again, that we on these benches have no difference in principle with the Government as regards the political, social and economic development of these homelands. It is an old policy in South Africa. It goes back to 1913, this policy of setting aside areas in which the Black people can live in their nations and of developing those areas and helping them to develop, and of also encouraging political development and growth. There is therefore no basic difference regarding the question of the socio-political, economic development of the Black homelands. There is no difference. Where the difference comes in, is the ultimate situation which these areas should reach. We say we stand for every possible development short of independence. We do not believe that it is in the interests of South Africa as a whole or even of those people as separate national units to become sovereign independent states. We do not believe that this is in their interests for many reasons.</p>
<p>In the first place let me come back to Venda and deal with the economic situation of Venda, its economic viability. The hon. the Minister has given us some interesting figures. For instance, he said that the increase in the gross national product of Venda in the past year was 25%. That is very encouraging. But, Sir, my Leader and I sometimes play snooker. When I pot a red ball the score goes up to one on the board. Then, 20 minutes later, I am successful in potting another red ball and then the score goes up to two. Then I say to my Leader: &#x201C;I have improved my position by 100%.&#x201D; So percentages are a little misleading, Mr. President. In fact, percentages can be very misleading, because if one has one thing and one gets another one, one has increased or improved one&#x2019;s situation by 100%. So, although I do believe that there has been some progress in Venda at the economic level, I am afraid that I do not regard that area as an economically viable unit. I listened with great care to what the hon. the Minister said about the economy of Venda but it was clear to me that the hon. the Minister and his senior colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, were certainly not <i>ad idem</i> on this matter, because the hon. the Minister of Finance introduced a Bill yesterday, which we passed, called the Financial Arrangements with Venda Bill. During the course of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech, which I have here, he said this&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Dit sou nie realisties wees om van die veronderstelling uit te gaan dat die verkryging van politieke onafhanklikheid deur Venda outomaties aanleiding sal gee tot die bereiking van finansiële selfstandigheid deur daardie land in die voorsienbare toekoms nie. Venda bevind hom tans nog in &#x2019;n posisie wat kenmerkend van ontwikkelende lande is. Die sekondêre en tersiêre sektore van the ekonomie van Venda het nog nie veel ontwikkeling getoon nie, en die bydrae van landbou, bosbou, vissery en jag tot die bruto binnelandse produk van Venda beloop tans nog meer as 30%. Verreweg die grootste gedeelte van hierdie bydrae kom bowendien van the sektor met eie produksie, d.w.s. the sektor wat nie die mark betree nie. Soos in die geval van ander ontwikkelende lande verteenwoordig die yle voorkoms van ekonomiese aktiwiteit in Venda &#x2019;n faktor wat &#x2019;n stremmende invloed het op die opwekking van staatsinkomste. Dit lê dus voor die hand dat Venda na sy onafhanklikwording nog die finansiële steun van Suid-Afrika sal benodig.</block>
<p>Mr. President, we agreed with the last proposition that Venda would for a long time need the financial assistance of South Africa. I said also that if the Republic of South Africa did not make that financial assistance available, somebody else would, and that is another reason why I do not like the sovereign independence concept. I will, however, refer to that again later. The point I want to make now is that I do not believe it is realistic to give sovereign independence to a nation that is not yet economically viable and, in the words of the Minister of Finance, will not be economically viable in the foreseeable future. I do not believe it is realistic and I do not believe it is right. For purely economic reasons, therefore, I do not believe that sovereign independence for Venda is the right policy.</p>
<p>It also seems to me that the greatest potential of this country lies possibly in its resources as far as coal deposits are concerned. It certainly is a very fine thing to have coal resources, Sir, but how does a small independent country, not economically viable, deal with those resources? It cannot establish industries based upon coal within its own territory because it does not have the capital or the know-how. It is therefore dependent on exporting that coal to South Africa or somewhere else in order to realize its value. And this independent state is an enclave in the body of South Africa, surrounded by the Republic of South Africa. This state is therefore dependent on the Republic of South Africa for the transport of its coal for export or for the market for its coal. In fact, independence does not mean very much if the state is an economic satellite to that extent.</p>

<p>What about Lesotho?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>I don&#x2019;t think it was a good thing to give independence to Lesotho. I was one of the people who said that we should incorporate it into the Union, as General Smuts had said. I do not believe Lesotho is economically viable and I do not believe that sovereign independence for Lesotho is a good thing. It has been shown that politically it is not a good thing either. The hon. the Minister is making my case because he will know that in the course of last week the Government of Lesotho opened negotiations with the Communist Republic of Cuba for reciprocal diplomatic representation. The hon. the Minister is making my case. I do not think that is a good development. In fact, I believe it would have been better for all concerned if the Protectorates had become part of the Union of South Africa in a federal arrangement.</p>
<p>But to come back to the question of coal, I believe it is no use having potential wealth if you cannot exploit it. Venda will have difficulty in exploiting to the full its resources of coal. It would be far better in economic terms for that territory to remain part of the Repub lic so that it can share in the wealth of South Africa and we can make the best use of the resources that are available there, like coal. So I return to my proposition that it is not good to establish sovereign independent states if they are not economically viable and if they will remain for the foreseeable future, satellites of the Republic in the economic sense. But let me leave the economic field now and come to the political field.</p>
<p>First of all I wish to deal with the domestic political field. The hon. the Minister said that 68% of the Venda people are resident in Venda. That is fine and a better percentage than in respect of many of the other homelands. This means that 32% of the Venda people are somewhere else. Some of them will be migrant labourers from Venda to the labour markets in South Africa. Some of them will be situated permanently on White farms. Perhaps the hon. Senator De Jager has some on his farm. Others&#x2014;and this is the residue I always talk about&#x2014;will be permanently situated in the urban areas of the Republic of South Africa. If in political terms independence for Venda is going to be regarded as justification for not extending political rights where they live to those Venda who are permanently resident outside of Venda, then I believe that is not a good deal for the Venda people. If we say to the people of Venda that they have their sovereign independence and that we are going to treat their people working in Johannesburg and in Pretoria and who are permanently resident there as foreign citizens and not as South Africans, I do not think it is a good deal for the Venda people politically. This is a point we always make and I will not labour it.</p>
<p>I now come to the question of the international situation. I have just said, with reference to Lesotho, that I am deeply disturbed by the political developments there, but we did not give Lesotho its independence and it is therefore not our fault. I am deeply disturbed by the rapprochement, the agreement between Lesotho and the Republic of Cuba. Heaven knows, if we have a Cuban influence established in Lesotho, we have great trouble. We know what the Cuban influence has done in Africa to the North of us, for example, in Angola and elsewhere. But we have no control over Lesotho. However, the point is that before we pass this Bill we will have control over Venda and there will not be any question of the establishment of a Cuban or other presence there. But if you give a state sovereign independence, and it is an economically non-viable state, you are asking for the intervention of other powers. You put yourself into the position where you will constantly have to outbid those other powers in terms of money.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>The fact that a unit asks for independence is a factor to be considered, but one must look then, as I have said at the political, economic and international situation. One of the most bitter and longest civil wars in history was fought in America towards the end of the last century between the Southern states and the Northern states. The ostensible reason for that war was because the Northern states wanted to abolish slavery in the Southern states. The Southern states wanted to secede from the Northern states. The abolition of slavery was the ostensible reason but that is a simplistic interpretation of that situation. That war came about because the Northern states were afraid of the threat to their economy by the cheap slave labour in the South and the South saw the abolition of slave labour as a threat to their economy. They therefore decided to secede and this war was fought on the question of the right of the Southern states to secede. They wanted to secede, just like Venda has expressed the wish to become independent. But that war was fought, and I am convinced that the economy of America would not have been as flourishing as it has been over the past century if there had been secession. You cannot simply take the desires of people into account in this matter of secession. It is a simplistic concept that you can do that. I am surprised at the liberalism displayed by hon. Senators opposite now. Do they want everybody to do anything they want to do? If the Black people of Soweto say that they want an independent enclave are hon. Senators going to say that they can have one? It is the same thing. I am not impressed by this pseudo-liberalism. I am a practical man and I look at facts and factual situations.</p>
<p>Let me get back to the situation in question. What do we do if Venda is misled or bribed into a situation by the offer of huge sums of money to establish relationships, let us say, with Cuba, Communist China or some such agency? What can we do when it is independent? We just have to outbid other agencies continuously, and the poor South African taxpayer will pay the price. The hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell, who is a wealthy man, throws up his hands, indicating that the South African taxpayer must pay the price. Let the hon. Senator go and say that to the people outside!</p>
<p>I hope that this will not happen because the Venda people are law-abiding, docile and good people. But how is Transkei going? I do not want to criticize a foreign independent state here, but how is Transkei going? Are we happy that diplomatic relations have been broken off? I foreshadowed that that would happen years ago, in 1960 in the Other Place. I said that we must be careful about the international political future of the Xhosa, because the Xhosa is a fiercely independent chap. If it suits him he is going to enter into alliances with all sorts of elements hostile to South Africa. I said that, and it is happening. This is not a good policy and it is specifically also not a good policy because it deprives the people concerned of their right to share in the economic wealth of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
<p>*One hand washes the other. These homelands, as part of the Republic, are helping us in the Republic to promote the economic interests of all our people. But if we fragment excise and separate, we make it difficult for those people to make the economic progress which they would have made if they had remained an integral part of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
<p>†The whole situation in Europe at the moment is towards closer unity, and not towards partition and fragmentation. That is the trend in Europe. They are going to find a European Parliament; it was elected the other day.</p>

<p>Must I give the hon. gentleman a lecture on Rhodesia? Do you know what the mistake was that was made with the federation of Rhodesia? They made it a geographical federation; they simply took three elements in which the White people were in the minority in each element and they said: &#x201C;This is a federation.&#x201D; That is no good. That is the federation my friends of the PFP propose. We say we want a race federation. We want Venda as a separate unit but we want it part of a federal arrangement. We want it to run its own affairs but we want it to be under the control of the umbrella authority of the Republic of South Africa. That is our attitude, and in that umbrella authority it will have a voice; it will have a say. We say that sovereign independence is a dangerous, reckless, economically non-viable policy. We have said it for 20 years and we shall continue to say it. So the hon. the Minister and I must agree to differ on this matter.</p>
<p>*I do not want to repeat all the arguments I have used over the years with regard to this matter but in conclusion I say that we are of the opinion that the policy of sovereign independence for the homelands is a foolish policy and history will prove it.

<p>Mr. President, in the first place it is a great pleasure for us on this side of the House to welcome you back. The loss of one&#x2019;s voice is a severe professional risk for politicians and we wish you a speedy recovery. In the second place we want to congratulate the hon. the Minister who introduced this Bill this morning&#x2014;yet another of our historic measures&#x2014; on his promotion. We are pleased that he has appeared here in spite of his promotion because he played an exceptionally important part in the formulation of this measure. I shall remember the hon. the Minister as one of those people who knows probably every piece of land in South Africa. He has worn out his shoes tramping over the whole of South Africa in his years of service as Deputy Minister in charge of the consolidation of the Black areas and, prior to that, as a member of the commission. Perhaps I am expressing an idle wish when I say that as the governments of the homelands become independent, perhaps they could provide some wet cement slabs so that those people who have left their footprints on the road to the development and establishment of those homelands could leave their footprints there as well. Then our Minister Hartzenburg would be one of those people whose footprints would be imprinted there.</p>
<p>As far as this measure is concerned, we on this side of the House will not take up much time debating it for the simple reason that this is a proud moment for us in that this morning we are laying the basis for the establishment of the third sovereign independent Black state within the geographical area of South Africa. This is the third step in which I personally and we as a party&#x2014;in spite of all the hon. Senator Horak might say&#x2014;believe honestly, sincerely and without compromise, namely the establishment of a South Africa of fatherlands, Black fatherlands as well as a White fatherland.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">A. M. VAN SCHOOR</person>:</from>
<p>The hon. Senator Du Toit can say what he likes but that is our pride and that is our idealism for ourselves and for our Black nations in South Africa. What really struck me here this morning was the information the hon. the Minister gave. The hon. Senator Horak is correct when he speaks of figures and percentages. Percentages might sound impressive, but the hon. the Minister went further. The hon. Senator did not even mention this. The hon. the Minister drew comparisons with acknowledged, recognized states in the United Nations, and I say to the hon. Senator Horak this morning that the names of Transkei, Bophuthatswana and Venda have more right to be included on that list of states in the United Nations, to parade before that wonderful forum than many other member states. I say further that when we compare our Black leaders with the persons in the United Nations today we can be proud of the quality of the personalities of our Black leaders. As a member of the White Republic of South Africa I believe and I am convinced that we have good reason to feel proud because the quality of the leaders of our two independent states and that of those of the emergent independent territories is much higher than that of many of the leaders already recognized in the United Nations. That is our attitude towards our Black people in South Africa. That is our pride.</p>
<p>We know the arguments of the hon. Senator Horak and that is why I say that I do not want to devote much time to them this morning. Today we see the fulfilment of yet another of the major steps in the policy of my party, of my government, a policy we believe in, and which I think is to the good not only of a greater South Africa but also of the individual nations and member states. I do not want to go into the arguments raised by the hon. Senator Horak because we know them. I may just tell him that I always listen to him very carefully but in this case I cannot accept his arguments. The past 20 years have shown that the arguments they have advanced against the independence policy, this abolition of guardianship policy, of the National Government have been refuted by reality and will be refuted even further.</p>
<p>He may be right theoretically when he says that Venda and certain other of our emergent Black states will not be economically viable. That may be so, Mr. President, but he knows better than I do that economic viability has never been accepted and recognized internationally as a test for sovereignty. More than three-quarters of the member states of the United Nations are not economically viable. On the contrary, such a deplorable situation has been created that a strong movement has arisen over the years&#x2014;which will not succeed because the voting count is against it&#x2014;that the voting strength in the United Nations should be determined by a country&#x2019;s economic strength and not on the basis of individual membership. Even the international community does not accept the economic argument of the hon. Senator Horak. Even less can I accept all the risks he paints and which he has projected over the years regarding independence for our Black nations and our Black territories as against his party&#x2019;s policy of independent units but within a sort of federal relationship. I could paint the risks attaching to independence for Black nations much better than he does himself. We are fully aware of those risks but we and the Black nations are very much aware of the risks involved in the policy of his party and particularly in the policy of the party of the hon. Senator Winchester. When we talk of risks we need only refer to the recent collapse, instability and chaos in certain countries.</p>
<p>The international community refuses to recognize our independent nations; it refuses to recognize Zimbabwe-Rhodesia; it is trying to out-manoeuvre us in the matter of independence for the nations of South West Africa and it wants to hand that country over to foreign Swapo forces. The fact of the matter is that in its own history the United Nations has recognized the principle of separation of sovereignty, even where there is no difference in regard to religion, colour or anything else, as was the case in the old Pakistan which is now divided into Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>We must look at our situation in South Africa. My party and the Government and I personally are proud to give our blessing to this Bill. We realize that we live in a world of risks but, when we weigh the potential against the risks, then I say that I believe in the quality of our Black leadership and our Black nations. There will be problems; we cannot expect this to be an easy task. But no matter what problems may arise, I believe in the quality of White and Black leadership in Southern Africa to move together in independence, in separate independencies, to a future where we will form an association of states in Southern Africa based on our communal interests.</p>
<p>I know that Transkei might ask the Cubans to open an embassy there tomorrow but I do not think it will happen for the simple reason that the demand for communal interests for everybody in Southern Africa is irresistible. It will work like a magnetic force and help us solve all our problems and overcome the risks. That is why I say with joy and with pride that my side of the House wholeheartedly supports this Bill.</p>

The real issue involved is that the NP Government came to the conclusion in the 1950s&#x2014;under the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2014;that it could never hope to continue to govern South Africa as a White political party; it could not continue to govern the whole of South Africa. The NP Government was unprepared and unwilling to share the political rights it enjoyed in South Africa with any other group. This is really the whole crux of the matter, Sir. We have had the argument that the White group was not the smallest group in South Africa; the Black people have been divided into many tribes and nationalities in an effort to show that the Whites are not, in fact, the smallest group. But it became obvious to the NP that they could not continue to govern South Africa as a whole in peace and that the only way was to bring about separation, and separation, as the hon. Senator Horak has said, was grand apartheid. This is all that it means. The whole purpose of this Bill which establishes a third independent homeland, is merely to fragment South Africa further because the Government is unwilling, politically, to share South Africa with all the people within its borders. This is all it amounts to. If hon. Senators opposite wanted to be frank with this House, they would admit that this was the reason. This is, in fact, the only reason why we have Bills of this nature. There is no other argument; there can be no other argument. All it amounts to is that the Government is not prepared to share the political rights in South Africa with any other race group.</p>

<p>Are you prepared to do so?</p>

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, certainly. Whether the Government is prepared to do so or not, Mr. President, is not the issue. I am saying to hon. Senators opposite that regardless of any philosophy they may have, regardless of the number of Black states they may establish in South Africa, I believe the time will come when we as White people in South Africa will have to find a basis of sharing political rights. And I mean all of South Africa, Sir, not that part that has been broken up into little bits and pieces. Whether that happens under a dispensation of the NRP or the party that I represent or a combination of the two with the NP, it will come. I believe that what Bills of this nature do, is merely to postpone that day and add greater dangers to the natural process that will ultimately take place in South Africa. Whether it will come under a confederation or under a federation, I do not know, but sooner or later it will come about. If their argument is, in fact, correct, then they cannot deny an independent homeland to the Coloureds of South Africa and they cannot deny an independent homeland to the Indian people of South Africa. You and I know, Sir, how ridiculous it is even to think along those lines because if that were to be the position, then Durban would have to be part of an Indian homeland and Cape Town would have to be part of a Coloured homeland. One can take this to ridiculous extremes, Sir! The Government is not prepared to face that possibility but in the meantime it takes a small group like the Vendas, a small country that is not viable economically and that is completely dependent upon South Africa, and tries to cast them aside saying: &#x201C;Now we have solved that situation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>What is really revealing in their whole argument&#x2014;and the hon. Senator Van Schoor has had the moral and political courage to admit it&#x2014;is that they say that the time will come, as a previous Minister, Dr. Connie Mulder said last year, when there will be no Black South Africans. That is Government policy. The whole intention is to turn around and say: There are no Black South African therefore we are not discriminating against Blacks. That then will bear out what Dr. Koornhof has just said in the United States, namely, that there is no discrimination in South Africa, because all the Blacks will then have their own homelands, their own sovereign independent States. That is why I say that what the hon. Senator Van Schoor has said is eye-wash and I believe that in his more reflective moments he will admit that it is eye-wash. All this Bill is about, Sir, is that the Government is not prepared to share South Africa politically with the other groups that live in South Africa.</p>
<p>Here I want to interrupt myself to congratulate the hon. the Minister. I offer him my very sincere congratulations on his promotion in the Cabinet. I welcome it because I believe the hon. the Minister attempts within the confines of Government policy to do his best. I welcome him to his new post and congratulate him.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister gave us figures to show the number of states which are smaller in area, smaller in national wealth and so forth than Venda. I am not going to dispute any of his figures in that regard. But can he name any one of the states he mentioned that is as integrated economically and politically with another country as the Venda people are with South Africa? I would venture to suggest that not one of them is. Some of them are islands, in fact, and are completely divorced and separated from their neighbours. So to use that as a comparison, I believe, is a fallacious argument. If one looks at the Bill and tries to ignore the two previous Bills that conferred independence on two other states, then one must agree with what the hon. Senator Horak has said, namely, that it will be independent in name only. The Bill further fragments South Africa and it solves not a single problem. For 20 years we have been dealing with this problem. Can the hon. the Minister tell me that South Africa is internally better off politically than it was 20 years ago? Have we fewer problems, fewer troubles than we had 20 years ago? Are we better off internationally than we were 20 years ago, now that this will be the third state to which we have given sovereign independence?</p>

<p>I will deal with their political rights. The hon. Senator Dempsey asked what will happen if they ask for independence. But what alternative do they have? They are denied political rights in South Africa. They are denied them for all time. What else can they do? What</p>
<p>else can they ask for but independence? Give them the choice between political rights in South Africa and independence, and one will soon know what they will ask for. There are people in this House who are better qualified than I to say what Chief Buthelezi&#x2019;s claim has been all along. Why has Chief Buthelezi, the head of the most powerful of the African states within South Africa, not asked for independence? Why has Chief Buthelezi, the head of the most viable economically, the most politically advanced state among the Black races in South Africa, not asked for political independence? It is because he has made the point, and I think he makes the point for so many others, that he wants rights in the whole of South Africa. He wants political rights in the whole of South Africa. This is what must come regardless of what the Nationalist Party are trying to do by introducing legislation of this sort. That is the answer to the hon. Senator Dempsey. [Interjections.] This Bill takes us absolutely no further.</p>

<p>Yes. There are very serious dangers. But the Government policy of believing that they can fragment and so secure South Africa is a fallacy. This was tried in Europe in 1848 and it resulted in something of the order of 60 years of continual war. I am saying to the hon. Senators opposite, that is what is going to happen in South Africa. The Balkanization of Europe created unending wars and unbelievable horrors. And that is what these hon. Senators opposite are trying to bequeath to our future generations. [Interjections.] They do not seem to learn from history. I believe that the whole crux of this matter, as I said earlier on, is simply because they will deny as far as they can political rights to all the other race groups. It is a question of permanent White domination of South Africa as we know it. [Interjections.] And if South Africa shrinks in the process to the stage where ultimately the Whites can dominate just a tiny little island in the Black mass, the Black sea around us, they will say that their policy has succeeded. [Interjections.] Mr. President, they may succeed that way but they will have destroyed South Africa completely and they will have endangered the lives of the people that they claim to be protecting. This I believe is the horrifying thing about a Bill of this nature. It offers sovereign independence in name only. It offers a title without any substance and without any foundation.

The time will come, and I have said this before in this Chamber, when there will be people of other races sitting in this Chamber.

Therefore I must oppose this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#odendaal">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. L. ODENDAAL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want to associate myself right at the outset with the previous speakers in addressing a word of hearty congratulations to the hon. Minister who is present here and to wish him everything of the best&#x2014;we know him and have full confidence in him&#x2014;in the future handling of the particular department which now falls under his control.</p>
<p>Mr. President, there was nothing new in the speech of the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat. In fact, we have heard that same argument hundreds of times here across the floor. It is quite useless to waste one&#x2019;s time in trying to reply to it. That is his ideology of consociation, of a unitary state and of human rights, of one man, one vote and so on, which finds no practical echo anywhere in the world and which is not realistically practicable. I think that the Opposition has no conception&#x2014;I really mean the party of the hon. Senator who spoke before I did&#x2014;of what it means for a nation to have its own freedom and independence and sovereignty, its right to self-determination and full citizenship, i.e. to have its own inherited fatherland. We on this side of the House and everybody who is realistic can appreciate this because we experienced the loss of freedom along a bloody road and its eventual recovery by constitutional and peaceful means. We know the value of sovereign independence and complete freedom. If one has no feeling for freedom, for nationality and national dignity, then one might argue like the hon. Senator who spoke before me. We who know freedom and who know what it is to lose it and get it back later can appreciate this. Our full sympathy and our best wishes go to the Venda nation upon the attainment of their sovereign independence as embodied in this short and explicit measure. This is undoubtedly a historic happening in our country&#x2019;s history.</p>
<p>The Venda nation at its own request is becoming independent, without any bloodshed, without any struggle or strife having preceded it. The hon. Senator who spoke before me, of course, still thinks in the imperialistic way. He thinks in terms of a unitary state within certain borders. He thinks like our ancestors or our former conquerors thought, viz. that one can throw everybody together into one state regardless of their colour or the language they may speak. We must remember that South Africa is the country in the world today with the greatest complexity of cultures and ethnicities in the whole world. We could throw all the nations of South Africa together and conglomerate them and form a consociation&#x2014;or whatever it might be called&#x2014;instead of the so-called fragmentation of South Africa. They want to keep South Africa whole, and this is evidenced by the arguments advanced by the hon. gentlemen. They are afraid that they might lose their riches. What are their real motives? It does not matter to us if great riches lie buried underground in these states. We have good reason to believe that there are such riches but we do not begrudge them to the Venda nation. If they can develop their agricultural potential to the full we do not begrudge them this sincerely, just as we claim it for ourselves. The question has already been put here and I repeat it. Why did we not object at the time to the independence of the British protectorates in South Africa? Most of them are less viable than Venda is at the moment. Leabua Jonathan, for instance, said that all that the former regime had left his country were a club and a few trout in the streams. In my view Venda is far more viable than the former British protectorates. The hon. the Minister has given us a brief insight into the possibilities of these states. They have a good rainfall and a very good agricultural potential and they have also shown that they have a really effective growth potential.</p>
<p>Mr. President, if the official Opposition here and in the Other Place continue with their idea of a conglomerate or consociation, a unitary state, they must surely be blind to what is going on in the rest of the world. I want to say a few words in this regard. They are just as blind as the United Nations because nowhere in the world&#x2014;and I challenge hon. Senators to dispute this&#x2014;has a conglomerate existed permanently, except of course in countries such as Africa and elsewhere&#x2014; and we are aware of these&#x2014;where it was not maintained by force and domination. Black Africa, for instance, in the twenty years of its gaining independence, has had no fewer than 40 <i>coups d&#x2019;état.</i> I want to read to you, Sir, what a Black Ghanaian student wrote recently in <i>The Chicago Tribune</i> of America about the position in Africa&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">In Black Africa there is actually little of the majority rule being demanded from those beleaguered White-run countries (here he means South Africa and Rhodesia). Instead there is for the most part only tyranny presided over by self-proclaimed kings, army juntas or military dictators, governments in which the bulk of the people have absolutely no voice.</block>
<p>We could give countless instances where people have been thrown together under the same roof and given so-called democratic freedom but where it still served no purpose, e.g. Cyprus and Belgium, and Canada where after hundreds of years the British and French are still not one nation and the French are insisting on their own independent state. Even the Red Indians in Northwest Canada are now beginning to demand their own state. The United States with its so-called forced integration, e.g. on the educational level, and their Bill of Rights of 1966, is another example. Prof. Hutchinson recently told a Tucsa congress here that the result of this has been that the Black ghettos in the American metropolitan complexes are still on the increase and that the situation is becoming untenable. We know too that New York&#x2019;s bankruptcy is due mainly to the fact that many thousands of Blacks there are unemployed and have to receive unemployment allowances. That is the result of human rights and freedom. Their compulsory integration on the educational level is a complete failure, as I have just shown by quoting American experts.</p>
<p>Old imperial India had to remain united. This led to a bloody war which cost more than a million lives before India was divided into three states along the normal ethnic and religious lines. Now there is peace. I am mentioning only a few examples but there are dozens. I am not even talking of Africa and the East where nations, as in old colonial Africa, have been artificially and forcibly brought together. Borders have simply been drawn arbitrarily and everybody living in that particular area is called a nation. We say peoples are nationalities, they are entities, ethnic groupings, and that is where our interest lies. The nations in old colonial Africa enjoyed no freedom, only tyrannical oppression and disintegration. In Africa there has been hardly any progress and even economic decline.</p>
<p>The idea of a consociation or a unitary state where many ethnic groups are thrown together is doomed from the start, and I want to refer to what Bishop Tutu told us recently&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Die idee van die PFP om &#x2019;n unitêre start te vorm waarin the regte van die minderheidsgroepe sogenaamd verskans sal word, is vir die Swartmense nie die papier werd waarop dit geskryf staan nie.</block>
<p>They can forget about it. The majority will govern and they will be under the heel of the Blacks.</p>
<p>In contrast to the aforementioned chaotic situation where a conglomeration of nations is thrown together, this Bill envisages something positive, the most positive position we can reasonably and sensibly accept. And that is the granting of freedom, independence and dignity to the Venda nation which traditionally is a humanitarian, positive and dignified nation. We recognize their independence and we rejoice with them on its attainment. The Bill before the House recognizes the attainment of freedom by democratic, bloodless and constitutional means. It recognizes the birthright of a nation to be itself, to live its life according to its own culture, traditions, morals and customs. It envisages positive good neighbourliness and mutual co-operation with the Republic of South Africa, their motherland. That is the honourable, Christian, ethical and rational solution as regards the concept of independent, mature, independent nations. That is the right of the Vendas, that is their desire, that is their hope, and it is our privilege to give it to them. It is our joy to be able to give it to them. We assure them that South Africa will not leave them in the lurch but will stand by them as in the past, <i>inter alia</i>, as laid down in the Bill adopted here yesterday. We are in earnest that they should</p>
<p>be free. We grant it to them wholeheartedly and we welcome this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. President, permit me to address you before I deal with the legislation. As I was not here to welcome you the other day, I should like to do so now. I hope that you will have a peaceful time in this hon. House. Often you will notice the younger Senators sleeping, and that is something the President may do as well. I assure you that no one will wake you. When I came to this House for the first time there was an hon. Senator here who knew the protocol very well. The first lesson we had to learn in the Senate of those days, he put this way: &#x201C;Gentlemen, you never wake the President.&#x201D; Mr. President, if after a good lunch you feel like dozing off for 10 or 15 minutes, we shall not disturb you, we assure you.</p>
<p>I should also like to convey my congratulations to the new Minister of Education and Training. I hope he will always hold the name of the Western Transvaal high, and I wish him every success for the future. As far as the hon. Senator Odendaal is concerned, I shall make no comment on his argument with the hon. Senator Winchester. But I would like to say to the hon. Senator Odendaal that I regard this third piece of legislation granting independence to a Black state within the borders of our beloved fatherland as a flight from reality as far as the Nationalist Party is concerned. The NP will not look facts in the face. Hon. Senators opposite speak of one White South Africa but I want to ask them where that so-called White South Africa is. An MP of the old United Party once said something in the Other Place which I think hon. Senators must take to heart He said&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">South Africa is a multi-racial country. If you walk down Adderley Street and are deaf, you can see it is multiracial.

<p>Where does that hon. Senator come from? I think we should send him back to the Free State. The fact remains that the urban Black man has helped to develop South Africa and he wants to share in the benefits. If we want to be honest with ourselves we must say that they can share in it. We must not fragment South Africa; we should rather let these people share in the economic benefits of the country as a whole. That is what these people really want. In this connection I should once again like to point out that my old party did not deviate from its policy over the years, and neither has it done so up today. That is as clear as daylight. We are willing to develop the so-called homelands to their fullest potential so that they can offer a good living to the greatest number of Black people. But we cannot imagine that fragmenting South Africa is going to solve our problems in this connection. I am glad to see therefore that the Minister of Co-operation and Development has also broadcast some federation stories. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I know hon. Senators opposite would like to do that to the Opposition but they will find it a little difficult. A further aspect is that we must compare the viability of Venda with that of other states, for instance Bophuthatswana. Bophuthatswana has probably the best potential for development and economic independence of all three of these units. What did Chief Mangope say when he accepted independence? He did not accept independence because the Tswanas wanted to be independent. Hon. Senators know very well what he said and I do not want to repeat everything. He said he accepted independence because to his mind it was apparently the only way to get rid of apartheid. There is also another difference between Bophuthatswana and Venda. [Interjections.] He also spoke of that hon. Senator because he is also one of the practitioners of discrimination which Chief Mangope did not like. He particularly did not like the hon. Senator&#x2019;s former newspaper. The other point we must put very clearly here is that Bophuthatswana has stated&#x2014;I am pleased to be able to say this because it is being said by other states in South Africa which will become independent&#x2014;that it does not want the Whites out of its territory, because it knows it can use the ability of the Whites. Chief Mangope proved this by appointing three Whites in his cabinet.</p>

<p>His Ministers of Health and Justice and his chief adviser on agriculture are Whites. Bophuthatswana possesses a far greater potential than Venda does in many spheres and the attainment of independence was probably not such a bad step for them to take. But Venda is in a much weaker position to utilize independence. This reminds me so much of people who ask for bread and are given the franchise. The hon. the Minister said that there are coal deposits in Venda but that territory is very isolated and has almost no road system or transport facilities. Venda will remain completely dependent on the Republic of South Africa in this respect. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has said that the per capita assistance supplied to Venda is as high as R49,22. I support the idea that we must help those territories to develop as far as possible so that they can achieve their full potential. But if that includes sovereign independence I must protest because I do not think the people of Venda appreciate it.</p>
<p>I want to put a last question to the hon. the Minister. Has the land dispute between Venda and Gazankulu been settled? A few years ago there was a dispute between these two territories in regard to an area of land adjoining the Letaba River which was formerly State land. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister if the matter has been settled. I shall not repeat all the arguments which the other side of the Senate have advanced over the years. I just want to say that I think this is a sad day and I think that most of the Vendas will eventually agree with us. I have no choice but to vote against this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. President, there has been so much repetition of the arguments advanced in previous debates regarding Transkei&#x2019;s and Bophuthatswana&#x2019;s independence that it is really unnecessary for us to argue too comprehensively after the replies which were advanced to those arguments from this side. I thought therefore it might be as well to give a short summary in six or seven minutes of the attitude in principle of the governing party in this country regarding the granting of independence to Black states. Thank heavens three or four parties are not governing simultaneously in this country; it would cause a Babelic confusion, Mr. President, the sort of Babelic confusion into which a man like Senator Winchester would fit well. You know, 3 800 years have gone by from the time of Abraham until today, and about the same length of time has elapsed since the Babelic confusion took place, and after all these years he has still not learned his lesson. I do not think he would learn it if he lived for another 3 800 years. The NP has a certain policy which does not make it a tyrant over other people, which the hon. Senator has accused us of being. Therefore it will do the opposition parties good to remember this tomorrow: The NP policy in regard to Black states is based on the Christianly justifiable principle of development and self-determination which results in the principle that we do not believe there can be protection for minority nations within a unitary set-up. The only other policy, the one of a unitary form of state, can have only one consequence, and that, as certain as we stand here this morning, will most certainly mean that they will go under and be destroyed and lose their nationhood for ever. The opposition parties can be certain that the NP will accept no federal or confederal system, no matter what the form, but rather a kind of commonwealth of Southern African states later, about which we do not want to hold a discussion here now. While the federal system may have succeeded overseas and may still succeed, the South African situation is not a parallel situation; it is completely different. The consequences of such a system would be diametrically opposite here to what they are in those countries.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. J. FICK</person>:</from>
<p>We could say again: Think back to the federal system which they tried to bring into being in Rhodesia; it lasted ten years and it was a failure. In so far as the Black man in the urban areas is concerned, we only want to repeat that in terms of NP policy they are and remain linked, tied to their mother nation in the homelands, and whether you or I think otherwise, they themselves know that that is so. They feel and bear witness to the fact that they do not constitute a real part of the White&#x2019;s different political set-up of which they were traditionally, to some extent, a part in the past. We want to change this. The NP policy is a logical and well-considered one and that policy has been put here time without number: Nations with specific national and cultural characteristics can only reach full maturity and enjoy guaranteed national survival in their own indigenous self-determining and constitutional unit. It is impossible otherwise.</p>
<p>Therefore our call is&#x2014;and on this note I want to conclude&#x2014;independence for the Black states; independence now for Venda, which has asked for it itself! The Venda nation do not want to be sucked up to and become a sham unit in a larger unit of a restless constitutional national set-up. At election after election the White electorate has returned us to this Parliament on the basis of that policy, and the Opposition expects us to do otherwise here.</p>
<p>Then senseless things are said such as those said here by the hon. Senator Winchester. He really reminded me of one of the wonderful men from the fatherland who sang one of the verses of the National Anthem thus: &#x201C;Ek sal lewe, jy sal sterwe, ons vir jou Suid-Afrika.&#x201D; That is the sort of principle he brings up. Sir, the Vendas are just as much Black nationalists as the Zulus or any of our other Black nations here in South Africa. And if you were to say to a Zulu: &#x201C;You are not a Black nationalist&#x201D;, and he knew what it meant, he would say to you (written phonetically): &#x201C;Oe na mangha.&#x201D; That is not true. And if you were to say it to a Sotho, he would say: &#x201C;Oea kala lesjakoe.&#x201D; You lie; that is not true. And if you were to say it to a Venda he would say: &#x201C;Wha zuwhiefa&#x201D;&#x2014;you lie. I do know something of their languages. [Interjections.] Yes, and one other. I could ask Senator Winchester, just as I ask the Venda. &#x201C;Dienjie oe maghahoe?&#x201D; Who made you? Where do you come from? One can see he was not born in this country and he has not been raised in the thought patterns of these South African national compositions and individual nations. We do not begrudge other nations what we claim for ourselves, Mr. President. The hon. Senator Horak spoke of homeland development. But he says they must only develop. We must take them a little way but we must not in reality take that development to the full expression of freedom and stability. This reminds one of what was said about students of the University of Stellenbosch in the old days. They always went on tour with Afrikaans plays and when they went to Namaqualand in the old days on the first tour one of them saw a young girl. We were all like that when we were young. He fondled her and flirted with her a little and when he came back on the next tour he thought she would still be willing, and he began again. But she said: &#x201C;No, definitely not.&#x201D; So he said: &#x201C;But I do not understand why you are like this. Last time we were here you were so nice.&#x201D; Then she said: &#x201C;No&#x201D;, and in that typical Namaqualand idiom which was used at that time, &#x201C;Not you Stellenbosch boys; you just &#x2018;njarrie&#x2019; us; you never &#x2018;njammie&#x2019; us.&#x201D; Which means &#x201C;you flirt with us but you never marry us&#x201D;. They say they want a sort of development of the Black states; they want to &#x201C;njarrie&#x201D; them, flirt with them; but they do not want to &#x201C;njammie&#x201D; them, give them independence. They are frightened to death of it. There is a Cuba and there is a this and a that which spells danger. Sir, we do not have a &#x201C;njarrie&#x201D; policy; the NP has the &#x201C;njammie&#x201D; policy for complete independence for nations created by God. We want to give those nations what we claim for ourselves. That is why, Sir, we cannot do otherwise than support future independence for Venda.</p>

He said, for instance, that the NP did not believe in a federal or confederal system. I shall talk to him about this later. There will be three parliaments under the new dispensation they speak of, and the hon. Senator Fick said that the day must never dawn when there is more than one government in the country.

<p>You said: What would happen to South Africa if that happened? That is what the hon. Senator Fick said. I cannot compete with him when he starts to tell jokes but what the NP wants to do to South Africa reminds me of the young married couple who had a baby. The wife was rather sick and it was decided that she would go away for a week. She went away and the husband had to look after the baby for the week-end. The first evening the neighbour heard the baby crying all the time. The child cried so much that after a while he went to see what was the matter. When he entered the house he went to the bathroom and found the father bathing the baby. The father had the baby by the ears and he was lifting the baby in and out of the bath. Then the neighbour said: &#x201C;No nobody baths a baby like that; you put one hand under the head and the other under the hips and then immerse him gently in the water.&#x201D; Then the father said: &#x201C;But you don&#x2019;t realize how hot the water is.&#x201D; Mr. President, that is what the NP is doing to South Africa. They do not want to burn their own hands and that is why South Africa is being pulled by the ears through hot water.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister quoted figures to show how Venda compares with other backward states in Africa. I do not think that is a good comparison, Sir. Can you imagine, Sir, what the comparison would have been had Venda remained part of South Africa? The hon. the Minister said that Venda had a higher per capita income than 28 other African states and that the percentage increase in income had been higher than that in 50 other African states. How much better would it not have been had Venda remained part of South Africa? Then the increase would not only have been higher than that of 50 African or backward states but it would also have been higher than that of many countries in the world.</p>
<p>I should like to refer to the mineral wealth of South Africa and how this fragmentation of the country will prejudice the whole of South Africa. South Africa is particularly rich in minerals, Sir; South Africa has so to speak a monopoly of certain strategic minerals outside the Soviet Union. But this fragmentation hampers the possibility of South Africa&#x2019;s becoming an industrial power in the world with all its steel, coal, etc. South Africa possesses between 60% and 70% of the world&#x2019;s supply of chrome. Zimbabwe-Rhodesia possesses about 25% and the Soviet Union possesses about 5%. If this proposal goes through, it will mean that South Africa will lose about 80% of its resources. At the present moment about 70% of South Africa&#x2019;s resources are to be found in Lebowa and Bophuthatswana.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, given the position of diminishing petrol reserves and supply problems of crude oil, coal and uranium South Africa can be expected to provide an increasing share in the energy requirements of industrial nations. While South Africa may have only 1% to 3% of the world&#x2019;s reserves of coal, it is deemed sufficient to sustain industrial growth into the 22nd century.</p>
<p>*Sir, 71% of South Africa&#x2019;s coal reserves are situated in the Eastern Transvaal and the Free State, 25% in the Northern Transvaal and only 3% in Natal. If we accept that much of these coal deposits is to be found in Venda and Lebowa, it means that South Africa will lose these resources and our position will then &#x2026;</p>

<p>But that is the truth. I say that much of these resources will be lost as a result of fragmentation. Those resources will not belong to South Africa. That is what it is all about.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, in conclusion I just want to say that the economic and social well-being of the Republic will be crucially dependent on an adequate supply of minerals for future industrial might and on foreign earnings from the sale of minerals. By cutting itself off from its most valuable mineral resources, the Republic will be committing what amounts to economic and industrial suicide.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, it is obvious that we are weakening our position in South Africa and in the world if we continue with this fragmentation of South Africa. It will mean that the mineral resources and riches of South Africa will be lost. We shall no longer be in a position to compete with other countries on the world market. These smaller states which own the minerals will be able to enter into treaties with other powers, Eastern powers. That is what will happen and that is what it will mean if we proceed with the legislation before this House today.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. H. O&#x2019;CONNELL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I shall not take up much of the time of the House but there are a few aspects about which I think one can rightly reason with the hon. Senator Horak. The hon. Senator has shown an attitude of reasonableness today. He has endeavoured to argue the merits of the situation and I want to respond to him in the same manner.</p>
<p>Firstly, does the hon. Senator Horak accept that the degree of sovereignty which we enjoy&#x2014;White, Coloured and Indian South Africa&#x2014;is dependent upon the degree of sovereignty which we grant to others? Does he in fact place an embargo on our own sovereignty by refusing to accord other nations in the Southern Africa complex their sovereignty? One cannot have it both ways, Sir. The hon. Senator Horak will be the first to say: Yes, we would like to enjoy a sovereignty that will ensure the continuation and the maintenance of our own culture and our own traditions. But at the same time he will qualify this by requiring that other nations be denied their sovereignty. Let me put it this way to the hon. Senator Horak: He does not deny that Venda is a nation, that it is a nation with its own language, culture and customs. He has not denied that by virtue of its ethnicity Venda has been independent of any other nation in respect of the maintenance of those very elements of its nationhood&#x2014;its culture, its language, its customs and its traditions. Does the hon. Senator Horak consider that the withholding of sovereign independence will create a greater financial obligation towards any state, in particular Vendaland or any other people, than in any event exists by virtue of their contribution to the total gross domestic product of all the economically independent nations of Southern Africa? Does the hon. Senator not accept that the ultimate development of a people lies within the actual national virtues of the people themselves which they develop and employ in their own interests? How can the whole be greater than the summation of its individual elements? Is it not so too that greater strength can only flow out of the progress and growth of those very elements? How can the hon. Senator believe that withholding independence will promote the national character of a nation? Is the hon. Senator not able to conceive that a people who are motivated by a sense of nationhood are stronger than those who live among other peoples in an amorphous state and are gradually forced to sublimate their national culture to that of others? There are also other aspects that we could raise. Time does not permit me to do so but the element of our policy lies therein that we grant the right to other peoples to advance to sovereign independent nationhood.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-education">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</person>:</from><p>Mr. President, in the first instance I should like to thank hon. Senators for their congratulations on my promotion. I sincerely hope that I will be able to serve this country with devotion. Thank you.</p>
<p>*I think we should start with the fact that hon. Senators said that there had been development. They are pleased about that but they do not want it to go further than development in the constitutional sense of the word. In respect of the development that has taken place in Venda and the figures I have given which hon. Senators Opposite tried to belittle somewhat, I can tell you, Sir, that the African states to which reference has been made, states which are poorer and smaller than Venda with fewer people, also adjoin other states. They are dependent upon and interdependent in respect of co-operation with those states otherwise they will not be able to survive. Some of them do not have access to the sea. They are situated in the centre of Africa and there has to be co-operation otherwise those states cannot survive. It is a fact, however, that there is not a state in the world, big or small, that having acquired its freedom has of its own free will elected to revert to its previous position because it was better. There is not a state in the world that, having acquired its freedom, has relinquished it again.</p>
<p>What is happening here, in spite of everything hon. Senators say, is that with this Bill South Africa is unconditionally giving the Vendas the fatherland that they have been occupying now for nearly three centuries as a unit which they themselves can govern so that the entire Venda nation can live freely within their fatherland, Venda. That is what is happening here and hon. Senators cannot understand it and will not understand it. That is why there is a basic difference between us. I may also tell hon. Senators that I shall not repeat all the arguments because we know what they are and we differ basically. Therefore it is not necessary to repeat everything.</p>
<p>However, what is happening here is a matter of history repeating itself, as we have heard. I have been asked how Venda, as a poor nation, will be able to develop the huge asset of hers, namely, the coal deposits that have been discovered there. The hon. Senator Moll and other hon. Senators now say that South Africa is losing something valuable by making Venda independent. That once again simply illustrates the fact that they cannot get away from the idea of colonialism and imperialism that they still harbour in their heart of hearts. A hundred years ago the Transvaal which was a republic at the time&#x2014;I am talking about the year 1879, exactly a hundred years ago&#x2014;was probably less developed than Venda is today. It was poor and small. [Interjections.] Wait a minute, Sir, the South African republic was small and poor but there were riches under the ground and the powers of the world came and tried to take those riches away from it. Venda too has underground riches and she also has people who have ideals, people who are inspired by a feeling of nationalism and idealism. Just as the people of the Transvaal started to serve and develop their fatherland so must the people of Venda be given the same opportunity of putting their shoulder to the wheel and developing their country because of their love for it.</p>
<p>Sir, you ask where the money is to come from. As far as the Transvaal was concerned, the money came from outside. Foreign investors invested money here in South Africa to assist in developing the country. We have said all along that fortune-hunters should be discouraged from investing in South Africa. Naturally we do not want them. After all, the genuine investors who came to South Africa with good intentions helped to develop this country and many of them decided to throw in their lot with us. The point I want to make is the following: I spoke to a prominent manager of a mining house the other day. He</p>
<p>told me that according to an estimate he had made, only 7% of the total earnings of the gold mining industry in South Africa during the previous century, i.e. since the discovery of gold, had left South Africa and gone abroad. The rest, namely 93%, remained here because people had to be paid salaries, and power and equipment had to be paid for in order to develop the gold mines. The only money that left the country was in the form of dividends. As far as Venda is concerned that will also be the case. They too can allow people to develop those riches. The major portion will remain in Venda and will contribute to the development of that country. Only a small percentage will leave the country and in that way those riches will contribute their share. And we should not begrudge them that. So one must not say that South Africa is losing something. The coal deposits in Venda have never belonged to South Africa because that region has always belonged to the Venda. We should not try to deprive those people of their heritage. Let us give it to them and rather help them to develop their assets so that they can have something to strive for.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Du Toit asked me to keep up the reputation of the Western Transvaal. I undertake to do so and he should also do so because I think all he had had to do lately has been to keep up the reputation of the Western Transvaal. I gained the impression that he was still dreaming of the olden days when he still had a party. The hon. Senator said he did not believe that the majority of the people of Venda wanted to become independent He does not believe that.</p>

<p>Yes, he says so. Very well, we understand one another. There was an election in Venda last year. Two parties took part, the ruling National Party of Captain Mpepho and the opposition party, the Venda Independent Party. Bote those parties are in favour of independence. After the election a legislative assembly was constituted and that legislative assembly decided that Venda should become independent. The Cabinet. &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, a constituted legislative assembly. The opposition gained the majority of seats in the election and the majority of the chiefs supported the ruling party. Consequently it had a majority in the legislative assembly. But they asked for independence and the legislative assembly appointed a recess committee to draft a constitution for Venda on which representatives of the ruling party and the opposition party served. The opposition party was represented on that committee and after certain amendments had been effected&#x2014;the opposition party suggested certain amendments, <i>inter alia</i>, who could become president and who not and how vacancies in the future parliament should be filled&#x2014;a constitution was unanimously approved and submitted to the legislative assembly.</p>

<p>No, their function was to draw up a constitution for Venda and they submitted a constitution which they had unanimously approved. Both the opposition and the government accepted the constitution. The legislative assembly of Venda consists of representatives of the opposition and the government as well as representatives from outside. Nine members of the legislative assembly of Venda live outside Venda, among others the leader of the opposition who lives in Soweto. The representatives in the legislative assembly adopted the constitution unanimously. The hon. Senator says the people of Venda do not want independence but he is totally wrong. The people of Venda have clearly and unequivocally indicated at an election and on other occasions that they want to become independent. There is not the least doubt about that.</p>
<p>As we all know, Venda is the third state in South Africa to become independent and consequently, when the Venda people went to the polls on that issue, they knew what it was all about; it was not a new concept to them. Hon. Senators cannot say that the Venda people did not know what the election was all about. The Venda people know that Bophuthatswana and Transkei have become independent and surely they talk to those people. The fact that those two states became independent rather inspired the Vendas to opt for their independence as well.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators have asked whether South Africa is better off because of the step she is taking now and because of those taken in the past. They say that the onslaughts from outside directed at South Africa have not abated. Mr. President, I admit immediately that the onslaughts against South Africa have not abated because South Africa still has her riches; South Africa is still of strategic value because the Cape sea route is still there. The Marxist world is anxious to lay its hands on these riches and to control our strategic position. So we did not expect those onslaughts to ease off. But we will be in a much stronger position to ward off those onslaughts because of this Bill and the step we envisage taking, namely, to grant the Venda people their sovereignty. They can now exercise self-determination to its fullest extent within their own fatherland just as we and other independent states are able to do in our own fatherlands. Now all the nations of Southern Africa jointly can defend their respective fatherlands against such onslaughts and in that sense we are in fact in a much better position than we would have been as a unitary state as hon. Senators want us to be. In such a case we would have a position similar to that of Angola where three different nations live in one country and fight against one another. In such a conflict situation they create an opportunity for the Marxists and the communists to gain power and to rob those nations of everything they have. That is why I say that we are now in an infinitely better position than we would have been otherwise, and there should be no doubt about that.</p>
<p>Mr. President, we have a beautiful combination in Venda. Dedicated people serve in the government. They are people who are serving their nation. The people of Venda are imbued with idealism for their fatherland Venda. When one travels through Venda today, one notices the wonderful development that has been taking place there over the past few years. Afforestation has been extended; for example, one sawmill is already operating and a second one will go into operation towards the end of this month. There are factories where black poles are produced; there are food canning factories where, <i>inter alia</i>, mangoes which are grown in Venda are canned. They are also concen trating on maize and wheat farming and have flourishing fishing and tourist industries. In the industrial field, for example, 16 Black industrialists have settled there over the past few years. Tripartite companies have been established doing building work and so forth. Mr. President, Venda is already a vital state.</p>
<p>What is happening there and in the other independent states of South Africa is a repetition of European history. Under the Roman Empire Europe was one big state. Strife, clashes and conflict among the various nations eventually developed, however, and when the various nations eventually became conscious of their own nationhood, that continent was divided and each nation established itself in its own country. There were still clashes after that but they became fewer and fewer until the European Community was established later. It was only after division had taken place that there was real co-operation.</p>

It is a matter which has been discussed on previous occasions under previous legislation. I do not intend to belabour the issue but I would like to point out that two prominent South African politicians, namely, the Minister of Co-operation and Development and the hon. member for Pinetown in the Other Place, have both stated overseas that what South Africa is doing is to protect the citizenship rights of all its peoples. This clause runs contrary to the statements they are making in the United States of America. To show my objection to the clause I am going to call for a division.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am deeply impressed by the calm atmosphere in which this Bill has been discussed in this Senate, and I was impressed also by the sincerity and the obvious concern displayed by members on the Government benches and on these benches with regard to this whole problem. I think it would be correct to say that only time will show who is right in this matter. There is no bitter difference here because this is a great and tremendous problem and the whole question is a very grave and important question. As I say, I think only time will show who was right in these debates, and we shall have to leave the matter in the lap of time.</p>
<p>I shall not go further than that. I could make a Third Reading speech and I could reply to some of the very good questions the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell asked me. I have the replies to those questions. I could also go into an economic dissertation upon whether the coal will be of more value to Venda as part of the Republic or as a separate state. I could talk about the process of decolonization in the rest of Africa and express the hope that this decolonization here will not have similar results. I do not think it will, fortunately. But I shall not do that I shall simply say that we will leave it in the lap of history. We will, of course, on our side oppose the Third Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator said that we might just as well leave it to posterity to judge, and all I want to do in this Third Reading debate is to read something from the annals of history. On 22 May 1917 the leader of the former United Party and the old South African Party, Gen. Smuts, made a speech in the Savoy Hotel in London. He concluded his speech with the following words&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">It has now become an accepted axiom in our dealings with Natives that it is dishonourable to mix White and Black blood. Instead of mixing up Black and White in the old haphazard way which instead of lifting up the Blacks degraded the Whites, we are now trying to keep them apart and in that way laying down a general policy which it may take a hundred years to work out, but which in the end may be the solution to our Native problem. Thus in South Africa you will have in the long run large areas cultivated by Blacks and governed by Blacks, where they will look after themselves in all forms of living and development, whilst in the rest of the country you will have your White communities which will govern themselves separately according to the accepted European principles.</block>
<p>That is the policy of the NP which it is now putting into practice.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, of course, everybody interested in politics knows that particular statement very well, but I did not know that the NP set so much store by what Gen. Smuts used to say. But I am interested in the Nationalist Party of 1979, and if one looks at what the Nationalist Party of 1979 is saying, it is a completely different thing. The Minister of Foreign Affairs says he is not prepared to lay down his life for apartheid while other Ministers are saying other things. As I said just now &#x2026; [Interjections.] Dr. Koornhof said in America: &#x201C;I believe in the right of every man to equality before the law, to full citizenship.&#x201D; This is also the Nationalist Party in 1979! [Interjections.] It is a completely different thing. He said that South Africa had entered a period in which all races were becoming involved in the decision-making. [Interjections .] In decision-making, not in the decision-making of separate states but in the decision-making of South Africa itself. This is what Dr. Koornhof said. [Interjections.] I can read what Dr. Koornhof said and other hon. Senators opposite can do so too, but they most probably read what Dr. Treurnicht said this morning in repudiating Dr. Koornhof. We have a little war going on inside the Nationalist Party caucus. [Interjections.] That is happening right at this very minute. Mr. President, what Gen. Smuts said was fine for 1917 but the Nationalist Party are saying in 1979 they do not even agree with each other. [Interjections.] So to my mind this is all a lot of nonsense.</p>
<p>I want to say, as I said earlier on in my Second Reading speech, that the Nationalist Party has adopted a hands-up policy. There is no question about it. They cannot hope to rule South Africa as a White race so they will split it up and they will end up in some little corner, tucked away somewhere, and say: &#x201C;Look we are a White government ruling White people.&#x201D; The rest of South Africa will have been hived off. It will be under attack by every foreign ideology in the world, Cubans, Communists, the whole lot, and we will be trying to defend it.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I do not intend to become involved in a long debate at this late stage.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I just want to place one further thought on record, and it is this: I know that there are difficulties in the administration and control of a Parliament as big as this one. I know that certain things have to take their turn. But I want to place on record my objection and my very sincere protest to you, Sir, as President of this House, that in tee past two weeks in particular we have had some of the most important legislation of the whole session to consider. In the early days of the session the legislation which came before us was non-controversial and we were able to spend a good deal of time debating it. I think it is a tragedy, and I do not think it is good parliamentary practice or good for South Africa, that we should have to debate such important pieces of legislation such as the Bill before us now at this late stage. I am quite certain there are members on the other side of the House who would also have liked to speak. We are fortunate in the Opposition in that our numbers are small and most of us get an opportunity to speak&#x2014;probably too often! But I know that there are members on that side of the House who have valuable contributions to make; whose views, though I may disagree with them, I respect; and I would have liked to hear some of those views. But, Mr. President, the mechanics of Parliament, the way in which we are handling legislation does not augur well for the democratic and the parliamentary system. I would appeal to the powers that be to let us at least have the important legislation early in the session when we can do it justice. I am not speaking only for myself because I know there are members on the other side who have good and valuable contributions to make to debates on legislation like this. We have dealt with a Bill this morning which gives sovereign independence, a high status, to the Vendas. It is a matter of grave and great importance and we have divergent views on it But it has gone through this Chamber&#x2014;I shall not say in record time&#x2014;very quickly. It has been debated and certain people have taken part in the debate but I believe it could have been discussed in far greater depth than it was. People could have made bigger and better contributions. I think it is wrong that we should deal with legislation of this importance with this speed. I do not think we do justice to this House, to ourselves and to the system of Government in South Africa. I just felt that I had to place that on record and I hope in future the Government will try to avoid introducing important legislation at the end of a session.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The turmoil surrounding the former Department of Information has for a considerable time now been the subject of intensive investigations and debates in this House and elsewhere. The matter was investigated in depth by a judicial commission of inquiry and the persons who had been involved and implicated in it were identified. My feeling is that it is a heartfelt desire on the part of all responsible hon. members of this House that we and our people should again be able to concentrate our energy and strength fully on the great challenges and problems which our country has to contend with.</p>
<p>When I say this, Mr. President, I do not mean that we should forget the lessons to be learned from this episode, or that the law should not be allowed to take its course, or that the final salvage work should not be disposed of properly. This will be proceeded with. In fact, this Bill, as well as the Bill on the State Trust Board and the one relating to the office of Advocate-General, contain measures to this effect. What I mean, however, is that the shock which the disclosures caused in our national life should now be shaken off, and that in particular the episode should not be allowed to dominate the true political debate in this country and the consideration of important matters of policy any further.</p>
<p>In an important sense it is consequently the object of this Bill to help bring this chapter in our history to a final close. With this object in mind it is necessary, from a financial and administrative point of view, for Parliament, and therefore this House, to take two steps.</p>
<p>Firstly, with a view to the future, this House is being requested to authorize the creation of a special account for secret information services on the same basis on which similar accounts already exist for other secret services. In this way essential covert projects of the new Information Service of South Africa which cannot be defrayed from its ordinary Vote may in future be continued under the clear and specific sanction, directives and restrictions of Parliament.</p>
<p>Secondly, this House is now being requested to deal with the extra-legal actions of the past and to get them finally and formally settled. In this connection this House is aware that State moneys were from time to time made available to the former Department of Information without covering Parliamentary appropriations, as required by sections 2 and 4 of the Exchequer and Audit Act read in conjunction with section 98 of the Constitution Act, having existed for that purpose. Hon. Senators will observe that the House is not being asked to appropriate these amounts retrospectively. In view of the way in which a portion of these moneys were ultimately applied, hon. Senators are not being asked to do this and in that way perhaps sanction or condone these actions by implication. The House is being asked to approve of these moneys being deemed to have been appropriated, so that this aspect of the matter may then technically be considered to have been disposed of. If this legal and financial instrument is not utilized in this way, the irregularity will technically continue to exist and it will not be possible to say that this House was finally afforded a proper opportunity to deal with and in fact dispose of the matter formally.</p>
<p>However, the amounts of money to which I have just referred were not only channelled to the former Department of Information without Parliamentary appropriation, but were also expended by the Department without Parliamentary authority. Similarly, as far as this second leg of the irregularities is concerned, these matters may only be finalized and disposed of by Parliament by means of appropriate statutory provisions. Here, too, hon. Senators will understand that I do not feel myself at liberty to ask the House to approve, authorize or condone the unauthorized expenditure. All I am asking this House to do, therefore, is to approve of what has been done being accepted statutorily as a <i>fait accompli</i>, so that the matter may now finally be closed.</p>
<p>The Bill therefore provides that expenditure incurred by the former Department of Information from its secret funds shall finally constitute a charge against such funds, which shall also be deemed to have been appropriated. I repeat: This measure should not be seen as condoning, authorizing or assenting to what happened. It is merely an instrument by means of which Parliament has to deal technically with the matter in order to get it out of our system.</p>
<p>Naturally it is not the intention of the Government to exonerate persons who harmed the State through their actions and misdeeds from any criminal or civil liability. On the contrary. The Bill makes specific provision for that. The law must take its course, and the Government has for a long time now been doing everything in its power to safeguard the financial interests of the State and to recover all amounts and recoupments to which it is legally entitled. This process will continue.</p>
<p>The House is aware that the Government has, since 1 July 1978, being salvaging the affairs of the former Department of Information. Covering statutory recognition is now being given in the Bill to the steps that have been taken in this connection, <i>inter alia</i>, in respect of settlements that have been negotiated and assets and rights that have been secured. In addition provision is being made for the further ratification of contracts which may be necessary on the recommendation of the State Trust Board.</p>
<p>As far as the progress being made with the clearing up of the projects of the former Department of Information is concerned, I can inform this House that the latest information which I have at my disposal&#x2014;as at 15 June&#x2014;indicates that just over R29,1 million has been recovered or is recoverable. Apart from this amount there are also various properties that are registered in the name of the State. Of the amount of R29,1 million, however, an amount of R4 898 074 had to be employed in the interim for the operation of certain projects.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, right at the outset I want to move the following amendment to the motion for the Second Reading of the Information Service of South Africa Special Account Bill, namely&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>
<p>The hon. the Minister and the House will realize, Sir, that this form of amendment is the strongest form of protest possible against any Bill. I intend motivating this amendment later but let me say first of all that we have no objection at this stage to the first five clauses of the Bill which provide for the establishment of an account, while afterwards it is provided that the account be credited with certain moneys from certain sources. It also vests responsibility and accountability in the new Director-General. We therefore have no objection to the first five clauses which deal mainly with administrative matters and the establishment of this account. But as far as clauses 6 and 7 are concerned, they are totally unacceptable to us.</p>
<p>*I heard an hon. Senator say: &#x201C;And that coming from you.&#x201D; I want to say to the Senate and to hon. gentlemen who are members of this Upper House that it is not only the Opposition that has a duty in this House but hon. Senators opposite as well. One of our duties is to see to it that money obtained by way of taxation is correctly spent and that authority is not granted for irregularities to take place by way of legislation. I think this is one of our most important duties.</p>
<p>One cannot use legislation to clean something that is dirty. One can amend it by way of a majority in a council chamber as in this case, but no one can tell me that something which is dirty, as this matter is, and which was revealed to us and made public by all three reports of the Erasmus Commission, can be laundered by legalizing it through the passing of legislation through both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>If the hon. Senator really thinks that the legalization of these payments and their transfers by way of a clause in a Bill undoes the matter, he still has a great deal to learn about how one rectifies something that is wrong in public life.</p>
<p>I do not want to spend much time on this Bill because we are at a stage of the session at which time is an important factor. Nevertheless I think that when we are dealing with important legislation such as this, one has to deal with it as thoroughly as possible in the shortest possible time so that the greatest number of details may be examined. Consequently I want to deal at once with clause 6.</p>
<p>As far as clause 6 is concerned I want to make a few remarks with reference to what the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech. The idea is repeatedly put to us that the House is not being asked to vote these amounts retrospectively, and &#x201C;the House is being asked to give its approval to these moneys being regarded as voted&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister is only asking us to approve the fact that these moneys be deemed to have been voted. Why should we be confronted at this stage with this kind of request, viz. to give approval to these moneys being deemed to have been voted? Sir, legal provision has been made for the transfer of these moneys. Does the hon. the Minister now want to tell me that in consequence of the sentence he has quoted here, viz.&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; the House is being asked to approve of these moneys being deemed to have been appropriated &#x2026;</block>
<p>that these moneys have not been voted, Sir, through the channels described by the Act? I should like the hon. the Minister to listen to my question.</p>

<p>I do not know whether this hon. Senator is in a position to reply by saying &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I am putting the question to the hon. the Minister, and the hon. the Minister is sitting and smiling very sweetly like a boy who has done something wrong and is now sorry about it. He states very clearly here&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; this aspect of the cases may then technically be considered to have been disposed of.</block>
<p>If he told me that this is his only aim with this legislation, then I want to ask him what has become of all the channels created previously which made provision for the technical settlement of matters of this nature? What about the certificates that had to be given by Ministers; the authorizations that had to be signed before certain moneys could be voted, transferred and paid? Why, then, is this provision necessary so that the matter can be regarded as being disposed of technically?</p>
<p>Then the hon. the Minister goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">If this legal and financial instrument is not utilized in this way, the irregularity will technically continue to exist &#x2026;</block>
<p>&#x201C;Technically continue to exist,&#x201D; Sir.</p>
<p>&#x2026; and it will not be possible to say that this House was finally afforded a proper opportunity to deal with and in fact dispose of the matter formally.</p>
<p>I now want to say to the hon. the Minister</p>
<p>that it is the considered opinion of this side of the hon. Senate that by dealing with these matters technically we are not disposing of them formally or morally. That we are not doing. The hon. the Minister goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Similarly, as far as this second leg of the irregularities is concerned, these matters may only be finalized and disposed of by Parliament by means of appropriate statutory provisions.</block>
<p>Then the final one&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; what has been done being accepted statutorily as a <i>fait accompli</i>, so that the matter may now finally be closed.</block>
<p>I think that is wishful thinking, Sir. No one will believe that by legalizing these irregularities in a Bill of this nature, the matter will be finally disposed of and can be finally brought to a conclusion. That is not what will happen. Because, Sir, what are we legalizing? When one looks at the transfers that have taken place here, one need only look at the three reports of the Erasmus Commission to understand and to read in those reports what irregularities took place there, not only irregularities committed by people who are being criminally charged but irregularities that occurred here in the proceedings and the workings of Parliament and the Executive of South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Defence must have realized that such irregularities existed, because in the first report of the Erasmus Commission, reference is made to a letter by Gen. Magnus Malan to the then Secretary for Information, Dr. Rhoodie, in which he was told that apart from the moral aspect of the matter, he would also have felt that way about the matter if his Minister had to stand up and tell untruths in a budget debate in order to obtain additional funds. Those were the kind of transfers that took place, because you must remember, Sir, that the greater part of these transfers came from the Special Account of the Department of Defence.</p>

<p>Any story can have a beard, but it can still be true. The truth thereof need not be disputed. The fact that it has a beard and the fact that it is true will not be undone by legislation of this nature, particularly clause 6 that seeks to legalize transfers. I cannot see this, and I want to know how, under these circumstances, one can justify and dispose of irregularities by legalizing them, irregularities of which the hon. the Prime Minister was aware by implication, because that is more or less what the hon. the Minister of Finance said.</p>
<p>What did the hon. the Minister of Finance say in his evidence? He admits to a lack of knowledge of the type of projects for which he authorized payments. [Interjections.] Sir, I do not know what the circumstances were. I have not yet seen all the evidence.

<p>The hon. gentleman who is today making his début in this hon. Higher House of Parliament in his new capacity as Deputy Minister of Finance should really not come to this hon. Higher House with such weak arguments if he hopes to make any progress. Let us look at the newspaper reports, Sir. It occurred this morning in this Higher House that hon. Senators of the Opposition quoted newspaper reports of what Ministers said. And what did members on the Government side say? They asked: Can one believe those newspapers? And they added: Do not believe them. And here the hon. the Deputy Minister says we can read newspapers. Of course we can read newspapers. But I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister: If he attaches such great value to what is said in newspapers, has he believed all reports that have appeared in the Press recently concerning this issue that we are now trying to dispose of finally, viz. the Information scandal? Has he taken those reports to heart? [Interjections.] I shall welcome the hon. the Deputy Minister to this House on a later occasion, but I think he has just welcomed himself. As was said in the boxing-ring in the old days, he forgot to cover up and walked into a straight right. The trouble is that he walked into his own straight right. That is the point; he saw himself in the mirror. I should like to repeat: The hon. Deputy Minister did one good thing by way of this interjection of his and that was to draw attention away from the hon. Minister of Finance. If that was his aim, he succeeded and I want to congratulate him.</p>
<p>I repeat that implicit in the approvals being granted here, is the recognized lack of knowledge of the type of projects for which the hon. the Minister of Finance granted the authorizations in question, authorizations by way of which these transfers occurred and by way of which certain projects were financed.</p>

He looks back to the past. He does not look towards the future.

<p>What does the hon. the Minister envisage authorizing technically so that this affair can be worked out of our system? I do not know what the hon. Minister is referring to when he says &#x201C;so that it can be worked out of our system&#x201D;. All I understand from the word &#x201C;it&#x201D; is that it is bisexual. It could be male or female. We probably have to guess what this &#x201C;it&#x201D; refers to, viz. that it refers to the Information scandal. However, let us look at what the hon. the Minister wants to do. He can now do the following&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; any settlement negotiated by or on behalf of the State on or after 1 July 1978 in respect of any contract concluded or purporting to have been concluded by the said former department, is hereby validated;</block>
<p>and&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; any act performed by or on behalf of the State on or after 1 July 1978 to dispose of any asset or right acquired by the utilization of money referred to in section 6(1) is hereby validated;</block>
<p>and&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; any expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1978 of moneys acquired by the State through any disposal contemplated in paragraph (c) is hereby validated.</block>
<p>This includes many things. It includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the sale of <i>The Citizen.</i> To ask me, as a member of the Opposition, to agree to these clauses and vote for them just because it is necessary technically, is not to me an adequate reason why I should support this Bill. I still want to know in what way <i>The Citizen</i> was disposed of. After millions of rands of the taxpayers&#x2019; money had been spent to have that newspaper established and founded, it was sold for a ridiculously small amount in comparison with the amount spent on it. To whom was it disposed of? To Perskor. Good National Party people are directors of that newspaper. We on this side of the House cannot approve of such behaviour.</p>

<p>I do not want to take up more of the time of the House, except to say that if I was convinced that we could get the Information scandal out of our system, as the hon. Minister wanted to maintain here, by the acceptance of these two clauses, then I could perhaps to some extent still be persuaded to consider this Bill more favourably. However, I am convinced that it will be pointless. This scandal does not attach to a certain party only. I am part of the people of South Africa, and the Government of the day is my Government too. Therefore that scandal attaches to me, too, as a citizen of this country. If there is anyone in this House who thinks that by accepting this technical clause in this Bill we shall clear the name of South Africa of this scandal, then he is making the biggest mistake he has ever made in his life.</p>

<speech by="#rensburg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Swanepoel has referred to things that are well known to us and that have repeatedly been discussed since the short session of Parliament in December last year. This reminded me of the time when I attended a meeting at which the question of the misuse of money under the previous United Party government was raised. It was the South African Party at the time. The late Minister Reitz was also present at that meeting. Someone in the audience got up and started to ask questions more or less along the same lines as those which the hon. Senator Swanepoel has just asked. He kept on asking questions. Then the late Minister Reitz said to him: &#x201C;My friend, let us get on with our work; there is work to be done; bring all your newspaper cuttings; bring everything you have collected; I notice you have a whole handful of them; I shall certify them as being correct and then we can carry on with our work.&#x201D; That is the position today in connection with this legislation. This legislation is an admission that money has been misused. It is an admission that offences have been committed.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>But you certify them as correct?</p>

</speech>
<speech by="#oelrich">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:</from>
<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister expressed doubt about it a moment ago.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#rensburg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>
<p>The Government have said that they accept the reports. Surely that is an admission. That has been certified. Nobody argues about that. We have now reached a stage where we say: Look, there have been irregularities; we are not going to argue any further and ask for this or that to be proved. We accept all that. We are now entering a new era and continuing as before. The hon. Senator Swanepoel took serious exception to certain things the hon. the Minister allegedly said. The Government said that it would expose everything.</p>
<p>The Government went further as did the commission. The Government said: &#x201C;Come and give evidence before the commission; we invite you and we are anxious to get that evidence; the evidence you can give will assist us in exposing the whole matter and finalizing it.&#x201D; And now, irrespective of the harm it is doing to the country, the hon. Senator Swanepoel refuses to leave the matter at that and to accept what the Government is doing in this connection. The Government says it accepts the position but we are entering a new era. The hon. Senator Swanepoel raised three points. If my memory serves me correctly, he said that he resented the fact that the hon. the Minister had said and as the Bill also stated that that was considered to be the position. Mr. President that is a term that is often used in the legal world. A position is accepted up to a certain stage. In other words, all the hon. the Minister says and submits by way of this legislation is that we are accepting the position up to this stage. We accept the reports of the two commissions. We accept that there has been a misappropriation of money and that there has been fraud in certain respects. We also accept that there has been theft in certain cases. However, we are not argueing about that at the moment, Sir. We are reacting by means of legislation and are trying to clear up the financial aspects of the matter.</p>
<p>When I studied this legislation for the first time, Sir, it reminded me of an insolvent estate. It sometimes happens that a prominent company is liquidated or, <i>inter alia</i>, a prominent person is sequestrated. In such a case a curator is appointed and in this respect the trust board that is being appointed here is synonymous with the appointment of a curator. The curator does not waste time arguing about money or assets that have been misappropriated. He accepts the position as it is at the moment and declares the estate insolvent. That is what is being done here, Sir. The procedure to be followed is laid down in various laws. We accept the situation and we are, in other words, in the process of liquidating the estate. In what other way does tee hon. Senator Swanepoel want the estate to be liquidated? Does he want us to argue for days, months and years on end about matters on which the Pretorius and the Erasmus Commissions have already issued their findings? Does be want us to argue about every small amount and ascertain in what respect this R5 or R100 or R300 has been misappropriated? Surely that is not our job.</p>
<p>Mr. President, we all regret what has happened in connection with the Department of Information. The Prime Minister and various members of the Cabinet have said repeatedly that the Government deeply regretted what had happened but that steps had now to be taken to clear up the matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore the hon. Senator Swanepoel resented another remark made by the hon. the Minister to the effect that the matter would be rectified technically. In other words, one cannot argue against facts and neither does one argue against them. We are not at this stage arguing about some fact or other because we have already done so. The Government appointed commissions and their reports were accepted. The matter has now to be rectified technically and that is what the Bill before us envisages. The misdeed must be put right technically. In terms of the Bill, 1 July 1978 is the date after which all expenditure on behalf of the State is to be validated.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel also resents tee idea that the matter should be rectified from a legal point of view. Mr. President, in doing that it is not being suggested for one moment that because the matter is being rectified by means of legislation the Government has accepted that everything was handled correctly and has condoned the actions of the officials of the Department of Information. We are now trying by means of legislation to put this matter right because there is no other way in which it can be put right. Clause 6(2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of section 8 any expenditure incurred or purporting to have been incurred for secret projects of the former Department of Information shall be deemed to be a charge against the appropriated money referred to in subsection (1),</block>
<p>We are not arguing about that Sir. We accept that something wrong has been done and in order to enable us to liquidate these liabilities we must take it that the money was voted for the department as provided for in the Bill. Surely it is not difficult to understand that. In terms of this subsection the money that has been incorrectly spent &#x201C;shall be deemed to be a charge against the appropriated money referred to in subsection (1)&#x201D;. Once again this is no condonation of moneys misappropriated but in order to finalize the estate it is accepted that the money was voted for the department. We are not arguing at this stage that the money was not originally appropriated. For the purposes of the Bill we take it that it was appropriated and we stipulate a date, namely 1 July 1978 and go on from there.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel does not approve of the following passage in clause 7 either&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; if he deems fit ratify any contract concluded or purporting to have been concluded by or on behalf of the former Department of Information which on account of the absence of authority for its conclusion does not bind the State.</block>
<p>Contracts that have been entered into are being investigated but if the Government has to bicker and argue over every contract and weigh up one claim against another, where will that get us? In terms of this legislation the Government accepts that people have acted incorrectly. The Government says it is ratifying contracts that have been entered into by those people. If we do not ratify those contracts we shall have to go into the question of whether or not those people were authorized to enter into those contracts. We shall have to determine whether or not they were empowered to take certain steps. And if we find that they did not have the power what are we to do then? Then the whole matter will be in limbo. That is why the legislation provides for contracts entered into by the former Department of Information or purported to have been entered into be ratified. Those words &#x201C;purported to have been entered into&#x2019; &#x2019; are important, Sir.</p>
<p>I take it that Eschel Rhoodie said on occasion that he was acting on behalf of the Government. The legislation now says &#x201C;purported to have been entered into&#x201D;. If we did not do that, where would we be? What hope would we have of ever finalizing this matter? What hope would we have of ever clearing up this matter if we did not take these steps?</p>
<p>Reference is made in the legislation to the date 1 July 1978. From that date certain settlements will have been negotiated and the Government will have done everything in its power to rectify this precarious position as it possibly could. Clause 7(1)(b) reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law but subject to the provisions of section 8&#x2014;<br/>(b) any settlement negotiated by or on behalf of the State on or after 1 July 1978 in respect of any contract concluded or purporting to have been concluded by the said former Department is hereby validated.</block>
<p>Once again this is only to have a starting point from which action can be taken. However, what follows is important and the hon. Senator Swanepoel did not refer to this because I do not think it suited his argument to do so. Clause 8 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The provisions of sections 6 and 7 shall not exempt any person from any liability towards the State or to be prosecuted for any offence.</block>
<p>The position is accepted up to this stage for the purposes of liquidating the estate and rectifying what has been wrong but the people who were responsible for the position are not being exonerated.</p>

<p>Irregular? Mention one country which does not have a secret fund and where certain things are not done in secret. The hon. Senator Swanepoel has said that he accepts clauses I to 5 unequivocally but clause 2(2) provides that money can be utilized &#x201C;with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance . . on such services deemed by the Minister concerned &#x201C; &#x2026; as being in the national interest and which because of the secret or sensitive nature thereof cannot be defrayed from the vote of the Information Service of South Africa for the purpose of (a) promoting the image of, and a positive disposition towards the Republic; and (b) averting the psychological attacks on the Republic. The hon. Senator Swanepoel did not object to that clause because he knew that that was the position in the rest of the world as well. No country tells the world what it does with certain of its funds. The purpose of this fund is, <i>inter alia</i>, &#x201C; &#x2026; averting the psychological attacks on the Republic&#x201D;. Surely the steps taken towards this end cannot be broadcast throughout the world. Surely that has been the position in the past as well. Surely the underlying idea of any secret fund is to prevent any harm being done to the country concerned. The hon. Senator Swanepoel said that he approved of that. This is a state of affairs that has always obtained but unfortunately certain people have misappropriated these funds.</p>

<speech by="#rensburg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>
<p>I have already dealt with clauses 6 and 7. One reaches a certain stage where circumstances compel one to accept things as they are. In this respect I have compared the position with that of a company which has been placed in liquidation and an estate that has been sequestrated. The curator takes the matter to a certain stage. He ascertains what the assets and liabilities are and everything that has happened up to that stage. He knows that what has happened is no concern of his; he only knows that he must clear up the matter as best he can. He must try to do the best he can for the creditors involved in the estate. In this case the curator is the State Trust Board and the board will have to determine what can be done that will be in the best interests of the creditors. I, the hon. Senator Swanepoel and every taxpayer in this country are creditors in this case. We want everything saved that can be saved.</p>
<p>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity of congratulating the hon. the Minister and his officials, especially the legal draftsmen, and to thank them sincerely for this legislation which deals with such an important matter. They have analysed the entire matter and condensed it into a few clauses. This is the first occasion in our history that a Bill of this nature has been submitted to us. Once again I want to emphasize that we have it before us only after it has been admitted that a mistake has been made.</p>
<p>If I may be allowed to use a figure of speech, Sir, I want to ask that we as citizens of South Africa should now bury the Information affair. It is no use fighting with a corpse. We are on our way back from the funeral to the house where refreshments are to be served. We only want to do the best we possibly can in future. We are sorry if there are people who have suffered loss in the process. If there are people who have done anything wrong, the law will deal with them. Let us say now, not only in the interests of the Opposition but in the interests of the whole of South Africa that the funeral is over and that we shall do the best we possibly can in future. Let us finalize the liquidation of the estate and find out what the highest dividends are that we can pay to the creditors. Every citizen of this country is a creditor or client in this case. I wish the hon. the Minister and the State Trust Board all the success in the world in doing the best they possibly can for South Africa by way of this legislation. Let us forget as far as possible what has happened and face the future with confidence so that we can try to achieve what is in the best interests of this beautiful country of ours, South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I think the last few words of the hon. Senator Van Rensburg were those that surprised me most. He said that we should go forward, forget the past and move into a new era in regard to this matter. But the public of South Africa do not expect that of that hon. Senator or of the Government. The public of South Africa expect to have their money recovered and the people who are guilty of any wrongdoing to have to pay the price for that wrongdoing.</p>

<p>That is not provided for in this legislation and that is where the confusion starts. I do not think that even the hon. the Minister of Finance can guarantee that certain people who have been guilty of a wrongdoing in terms of the legislation can still be prosecuted after this Bill has been passed with retrospective effect because its retrospective effect will make certain of these actions legal. But let us agree to disagree on that particular point. The hon. Senator Van Rensburg said some other things with which I want to deal with immediately.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Rensburg said that the Government was not pleased with what had happened and that it was unhappy about this whole incident. The hon. Chief Whip nods his head, but they have not demonstrated that they are overly concerned about this. If they were overly concerned about the incidents that took place why did they allow <i>The Citizen</i> to slip out of the hands of the public of South Africa who had paid for this newspaper? How can the hon. Senator Van Rensburg tell me that the Government and the Nationalist Party were unhappy with events and yet they allowed <i>The Citizen</i> to be disposed of in the manner in which it was?</p>

<p>I certainly am not, are you? Are the people of South Africa satisfied? [Interjections.] The Government showed complete contempt for tee people of South Africa by the manner in which it allowed <i>The Citizen</i> to be sold to Perskor. The hon. Senator must know that. The people of South Africa still mistrust the Government, no matter what it says about the Information scandal. The people of South Africa will never forgive the Government for what it did and the way it disposed of <i>The Citizen.</i> The hon. the Minister of Finance can shake his head as much as he likes; I am telling him that until that matter is cleared up satisfactorily the people of South Africa say they are being treated with contempt in regard to this matter. [Interjections.] I for one, for instance, can never accept the sincerity of the Government in regard to the Information scandal until they have assured me that they have done the best for the people of South Africa in the disposal of <i>The Citizen.</i></p>
<p>Can the hon. the Minister tell me, for instance, how much it cost the State to meet the monthly losses incurred by <i>The Citizen</i> after it became known that it had been financed by the Department of Information? [Interjections.] Perhaps the hon. Senator who is making so much noise can tell me, because nobody else knows. It was assumed that <i>The Citizen</i> was losing R15 000 a month. This was after the scandal broke and everybody knew who was behind the formation of <i>The Citizen.</i> It continued to lose money at the rate of R150 000 a month and nobody has been able to say where that money came from.</p>

This is why I say that this in fact is one of the greatest scandals of them all. But I would go further. I would say that this Bill, in fact, puts the stamp of approval on illegal actions.</p>

<p>Whenever that hon. Senator says &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D; then I feel quite happy that I am on the right track. This Bill whitewashes some of the things that took place and it demonstrates, as I said just now, the Government&#x2019;s complete contempt for the man in the street, the taxpayer of South Africa. It shows the Government&#x2019;s complete contempt for public opinion. I would say that in some ways I believe that the Bill itself is probably a more shameful thing that the Information scandal itself.</p>

<p>No, Sir, it seems to try to push the scandal aside, to put what happened aside and push it into the background. The Government would like to see that happen. The Government prays it will happen, and Heaven knows we all hope that we can move away from the Information scandal. But this piece of legislation will perpetuate the Information scandal. It must do, because if one looks at the wording it reeks of covering up, of legalizing illegalities. And there is no other way that one can look at it. The hon. Senator Van Schoor can shake his head as much as he likes; this is what is in the printed document before us.</p>

<p>How can one support legislation which legalizes illegalities? That is what this is doing, and this, Sir, is why we certainly could never support this Bill. It is retrospective; it makes legal something which was illegal. The hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Defence acted improperly when they allowed money to pass from the Department of Defence to the Department of Information. They acted contrary to the law, and the hon. the Minister of Finance must be the first to admit it because his evidence to the Erasmus Commission was to the effect that he did not like it; it was something he had inherited and he had protested against it. But the hon. the Minister must admit&#x2014;he must be the first to admit&#x2014;that those actions were in fact not proper; they were illegal at the time. They were illegal in terms of our constitutional processes. He knew that the way in which he was doing those things was not the way he should have been doing them in terms of the powers entrusted to him as Minister of Finance. But he went along with it; he protested but he went along with it. The Minister of Defence knew that what was happening was wrong. He protested but he went along with it. This Bill before us now puts that matter right. It now says that their hands in that respect are clean and that no blame attaches to them. But, Mr. President, you cannot just wipe the slate clean in that manner. [Interjections.] And the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter can laugh like a hyena if he wishes, but these are the facts of the matter. You cannot just say that it was wrong a week ago or a day ago and then wave a magic wand and suddenly everything becomes pure and clean. It does not work like that, Sir, except perhaps in the Nationalist Party ranks.</p>

<speech by="#deputy-president">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</person>:</from>
<p>I must point out to the hon. Senator that the Minister of Finance has repeatedly assured this House that he did not know what these projects were.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>No, Sir, I am not arguing about the projects; I am not delving into the old matters of the report What I am saying is that the hon. the Minister stated in his evidence, as did the hon. the Minister of Defence, that money passed from the Department of Defence to the Department of Information. The Minister of Finance did not like it. He objected to it. It was something he had inherited. The Minister of Defence did not like it but it was something that he too had inherited, or something that he had been instructed to do. I am not talking about the projects themselves. This has been the claim of the Minister of Finance right from the beginning. I am not arguing with it one iota. But what this Bill does now is to put that matter right. It says that the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s attitude was the correct one because it validates some past wrong. Therefore, it exonerates him from any blame, any authoritative blame, and it exonerates the present Prime Minister. I do not believe that one can act in this way. I want to give hon. Senators an example of what I mean. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>Yes, let me give hon. Senators an example. Some two or three years ago we sent our troops into Angola and we had to pass retrospective legislation to make that legal because at the time the manner in which they were sent into Angola was illegal. It was against the South African Constitution. It had to be legalized by a Bill being passed through this House. But if we are to act in this manner in the future, it means that every time the Government commits a wrong in terms of our Constitution or in terms of the law, or if the Minister makes a mistake, it can ratify that mistake by merely bringing legislation to this House and backdating it, making it retrospective. Then suddenly it becomes pure and clean as the driven snow and everybody is happy again.</p>
<p>But who can tolerate such a system? What do we have laws for if we can rectify errors committed wittingly or unwittingly by the Government simply by introducing legislation and backdating it? We cannot run a country in that manner but I say we owe more than that to the public of South Africa. We are here to protect them. We pass legislation which they can study if they so wish so that they can see that this is how the law operates. This is how we are governed. This is the system of government that we have. But that will mean nothing because every time something is done by an official, by a Cabinet Minister or by the Government as a whole, which is in error, it simply rectifies that by passing retrospective legislation. That is what we are doing here this afternoon. I cannot see how hon. Senators over there can just sit back and take it so calmly, so quietly. [Interjections .] Where else does this sort of thing happen? [Interjections.] I want to say to the hon. Senator De Jager that there is nothing new to him in this at all. He accepts this method of government because he does not believe that any hon. Minister sitting on those front benches can do anything wrong. Everything they do and say is correct; he does not question what they do but I am in a different position.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Rensburg talked about clause 1. He said every country in the world has a secret service account. The hon. Senator Swanepoel did not deal in particular with clause 1; he concentrated on clause 6. But I object to clause 1 as well, Sir. While I accept that every country in the world has a secret service account and has to involve itself in secret service matters&#x2014;heaven help it if it did not!&#x2014;I do not believe that that is the function of a Department of Information. For a Government to run a Department of Information effectively and for it to have some force, such a Department of Information must be frank and it must be open. The moment it is not, it becomes suspect. All these secret matters in which the department got itself involved were matters that would have been better handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Experience has proved this. That is really the function of the Department of Foreign Affairs. But the trouble we got into was because we allowed the Department of Information to involve itself in secret matters in regard to which it had no expertise and no experience and as a result it made a hash of those matters. So when clause 1 allows the new Information Service to have a secret fund I say I do not agree with that at all. I believe that to be effective, the Information Service must be open and frank. In that way what it does and says will be believed. I do not believe it will be believed in any other way. Secret services should be conducted by the department that is specially trained to handle them. Experience has shown in the past that this department was not able to handle such matters and that is why it got into the mess it did.</p>
<p>I must certanly vote against legislation of this nature. As I said right at the beginning I believe that in retrospect it may well be found that this piece of legislation, these few clauses, may in the long term be shown to have been more damaging to South Africa than the Department of Information scandal itself. It may in the long term prove to be the greatest scandal of them all.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#poorter">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I do not think any hon. Senator on this side of the House really expected the Opposition to support this legislation. The reasons are very clear to those of us who sit here as to why they will not support this kind of Bill. I want to acknowledge that Senator Swanepoel said he would support clauses 1 to 5, which was at least an admission that there was some good in this Bill for the future. Both the Opposition parties regard clauses 6 to the end as being not supportable while the hon. Senator Winchester said that he would, in fact, not even support clause 1. Why does the Opposition not want to support this kind of Bill? The answer is very simple, Sir. In all the years of their existence, the Opposition has never had such a wonderful horse to ride as the Information scandal. If they support this Bill they realize that they will be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. They have in fact been exploiting the embarrassment of the Government in regard to the Information scandal since the day it broke. In politics one expects political parties to be able to do so, but to go on <i>ad infinitum</i> is like brooding on an egg until such time as it does not hatch but goes rotten. That is what has happened with the Information scandal. I put it to the Opposition quite squarely that this egg is no longer going to hatch to the advantage of the Opposition but that it turned rotten long ago. The results of the various elections throughout the country disprove entirely the statement made by the hon. Senator Winchester who believes that he is, shall I say, the saviour of South Africa, and that his party is the bastion between this evil Government and the people; that his party is going to protect the people of this country from this evil Government.</p>
<p>I think the record of the hon. the Prime Minister of this country is one which one should examine if one wishes to determine what the clear intention of this Government is. Within ten minutes of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s having been elected, he stood on our Senate steps and said: &#x201C;I stand for the kind of administration which is clean.&#x201D; He made certain promises and he made certain predictions. He said that if it could be proved that one single member of his Cabinet had been involved in this Information scandal, he would resign. No person could at that stage have taken a greater weight of trust upon his shoulders than did the hon. the Prime Minister. By virtue of this legislation we on this side of the House are trying to regularize something which was irregular. We make no bones about it, Sir. The hon. Senator Van Rensburg has put the case from a legal point of view. He has put his case most admirably and I certainly cannot improve on it. He said unequivocally that something was wrong, that something was irregular and that it had to be regularized through this legislation. The legislation speaks for itself, Sir. In no way does the hon. the Minister ask any hon. Senator to associate himself with any of the things that were wrong in the past. He merely says that there have been wrongdoings and that we have to regularize them. By regularizing them by means of this legislation, we are not spending one extra cent; and if we did not pass the Bill we would not be saving one extra cent. Therefore, I cannot understand the arguments of hon. Senators opposite other than to presume that they are trying to make this little political horse that they have been riding and riding, continue galloping <i>ad infinitum.</i> That is the intention of the Opposition. We heard it on the 1.30 news. I heard that in the Other Place the hon. member for Yeoville had said exactly the same as the little dog having listened to His Master&#x2019;s Voice was saying in this House. This is the sort of repetition that we have to listen to in this House time after time. I think this is the fifth time in five months that we have had a rehash of the Information scandal. One would have expected the Opposition to have taken a more realistic view; to have looked into the future, past this Information scandal from which they have been trying to extract some political advantage for themselves. One would have expected them to do that and to recognize the problems of South Africa; to recognize what lay on the road ahead for all of us&#x2014;every single Senator irrespective of the party to which he belongs&#x2014;the road into the future along which every one of us will have to play our part.</p>
<p>We are thinking along the lines of a new Constitution. Instead of applying its mind to that, Sir, the Opposition has for the duration of the session been applying its mind as to how best to exploit the Information scandal further. The speeches by the hon. Senator Swanepoel and the hon. Senator Winchester this afternoon have proved that they cannot see any further than that. All they are interested in is gaining a minor political advantage instead of seeing the wide horizons of what lies in store for South Africa.</p>
<p>I am proud to support this Bill and to wish the hon. the Minister godspeed with it. I know that by regularizing something that was irregular we are going to get away from this Information scandal and that if the Opposition do not want to forget about it they will be left behind and it will be the electorate that will be their judges not us.</p>

<speech by="#oelrich">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, in reply to the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat and who accused the official Opposition in this House of exploiting the Information scandal, I want to put a question to him that I put earlier on during this session: Must we of the Opposition be expected merely to sit by and project an image of weak-kneed capitulation when the public are most unhappy about a situation that needs to be cleared up clearly and distinctly? I think if he thinks very carefully about that he must realize that we are not only speaking from a political point of view but also because we are patriots in South Africa and would like to see this matter cleared up, but in the right way.</p>
<p>*I wanted to welcome the hon. the Deputy Minister, but he has disappeared. We shall leave the matter at that.</p>
<p>Let me also say that I wish to place on record my satisfaction with the speech made by my colleague, the hon. Senator Swanepoel. He hit the nail on the head. He made a very excellent speech under these special circumstances. I want to ask my hon. colleagues, on both sides of this House: Are the hon. Senators, on the opposite side in particular, proud of the history of the past year or 15 months, yes or no? Are you proud of it? [Interjections.] That is the point. That is why I have just said that we want this matter cleared up in the right way. After all, these events are a blot on the responsible national administration of South Africa, something which we as hon. Senators must surely condemn. I, in my position, condemn it in the strongest terms. How can we be expected, under these circumstances, to approve of the provisions of clauses 6 and 7, the relevant clauses in this particular debate? My hon. colleague pointed out that clauses 1 to 5 are acceptable to us, but not clauses 6 and 7. After all, one must face up to reality. It avails us nothing to rectify technically, by means of a measure of this nature, what South Africa has for the past few months been trying to conceal from its already concerned voters and simply tried to sweep under the carpet.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Rensburg told an anecdote here about a very good acquaintance of mine, the former Minister Deneys Reitz. &#x201C;Bring your cuttings and I shall sign them so that we can carry on with our work.&#x201D; That is what Minister Reitz was supposed to have said, according to that hon. Senator. The Deputy Minister, who unfortunately is not present here at the moment, asked just prior to the speech of the hon. Senator by way of an interjection whether we on this side of the House relied on newspaper reports. Now the appeal of the hon. Senator Van Rensburg puts me in mind of the young rugby team which, as soon as things were going badly for them, suddenly wanted to change the rules. I have not been in politics for a short while only. I have been a politician for many years. I think it has been 40 to 45 years and perhaps even longer. And in all those years I was not aware of the Nationalist Party, as we know it today and when it was in Opposition, ever being in favour, then or now, of making concessions on any particular point in respect of which they would have been able to gain an unfair advantage for themselves. It all comes back to the point which the hon. Senator Poorter made, and that is politics.</p>
<p>We have heard the word &#x201C;irregular&#x201D; used frequently from both sides of this House. Where in the world are secret funds not made available? That was the question which the hon. Senator Van Rensburg put to us. The important link here is the reliability of the officials who carry out these instructions in conjunction&#x2014;and I want to emphasize this&#x2014; with the Minister of that department, and possibly, too, other Ministers who bear the responsibility for what has been done. I am convinced that the arguments which my colleague, the hon. Senator Swanepoel, advanced, in opposing this Bill to the utmost, are the correct attitude and we shall vote against this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I want to commence by replying immediately to the question directed by the hon. Senator Oelrich to the Government supporters, namely whether we are proud of what has happened over the past year. I have said this before and I want to emphasize it with all the power at my command: We are not proud of it. We are ashamed of what happened and what was wrong. As ashamed as we are of what happened and what was wrong, so are we in deadly earnest in moving away from this evil-smelling rubbish heap. We do not want to spend any more time on it. However, I gained the impression today that during all the years that I have been in this House the Hon. Senator Swanepoel has never before been as melodramatic as he was today. And do you know why, Mr. President? I gained the impression that the hon. Senator enjoyed walking past something that gave off an unpleasant odour. That was the impression that I gained. He enjoys that odour.</p>

I am prepared to approve of this legislation without even having seen it so that we can open a fresh page and turn our backs upon what has happened and forget about it.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Winchester said that it was not right to expect the Opposition to condone something that was wrong. I want to tell the hon. Senator Winchester that as far as I know it is common practice in Parliament and in provincial councils to approve of unauthorized expenditure at a later date. There is a Select Committee for that purpose. They consider numbers of such cases every year and it is immaterial whether the amounts involved are big or small. That is done every year. That is standard practice. For that reason I cannot be enthusiastic enough today in supporting this legislation. Let us in a technical way finalize those things that were not right once and for all. Let us shake their dust off our shoes, take a fresh look at the future and get our priorities right.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we envisage three principal objects with this Bill. In the first place we want to make provision for the establishment of a secret account for Information. I think this is very essential. All of us think so, after having evaluated this matter very thoroughly for months. We obtained very good advice on these matters. We also caused an investigation to be instituted into what is happening abroad in well-known Western countries, and there is nothing at all unusual in that connection. It is felt that this is the correct approach. Consequently that is what we want to make possible here.</p>
<p>Secondly there are the financial procedures concerning the transference of funds from one department to another. Since certain transactions have occurred in recent years in the context in which we have discussed them here, we should now like to state that these are deemed to have been appropriated. That transfer of funds is deemed to have been appropriated.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I want to ask the Opposition at once what else we should do if we do not do this? Is this not the action of an honest Government which does not want to conceal anything in this connection, but wants to tell the people: This is what happened, and we are now rectifying the matter formally. The hon. Senator Swanepoel objects to the use of the word &#x201C;technical&#x201D;, but that is the absolutely correct word. What is this if it is not a technical rectification of the financial procedures that were adopted?</p>
<p>There are more than three important aspects which are relevant here, but as far as I am concerned, these are the three crucial matters. For a long time now the salvage work has been in progress here. Shortly after his appointment our present Prime Minister took the initiative of immediately appointing the Pretorius Committee under the chairmanship of the former Secretary to the Treasury, one of our most senior and most experienced officials in the entire Public Service. The terms of reference of this committee were, in the first place, to make a thorough study of the secret projects, as they are called, of the former Department of Information. The committee had to make a thorough evaluation and establish whether all those projects were undesirable and consequently had to be stopped, or whether there were projects which were positive and which were in the national interests. The Pretorius Committee found, after a very thorough investigation, that a large number of those projects were well-founded, were positive, and that there was nothing wrong with them. The committee recommended without any reservations that those projects should be continued. In other words, the amount of R64 million which was mentioned in the Erasmus Commission report as the relevant amount in the secret activities of the former Department of Information&#x2014;to put it like that&#x2014;had not suddenly all been lost. It had not all been wasted. Not at all.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>And the R30 million for <i>The Citizen</i>?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>This authoritative committee recommended that a large number of these secret projects should be continued. The Government went into this recommendation very thoroughly and adopted certain resolutions in that connection. That is one of the reasons why we wish to move formally today that we must have an official secret account for Information. For if these are delicate projects that have to be kept secret, how can that money then be paid into the ordinary account of the Information Department and expended from that account? If we were to do this, the project would in no way be secret, delicate or sensitive. And we are not the only country which has such an account either; in fact, it is normal practice in the Western World. I am referring only to the Western world now, Sir, because I do not know what is happening in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>This Bill therefore makes provision for salvage work in order to safeguard as far as possible the assets of the State involved and to recover any cash which is in jeopardy. If certain expenditure is involved in this process, i.e. if the Pretorius Committee or the body which has just been established, the State Trust Board which will continue this salvage work has to spend money in order to continue its activities, it has to be appropriated. Perhaps certain settlements have to be made, because there are contracts at stake. After all, a Government cannot simply throw contracts out of the window, Sir, because other parties are also involved. If certain amounts have to be paid out in the national interests, this has to be done and this Bill makes provision for that. I am sorry that no reference was made to this, because it is a very positive step.</p>
<p>What have we achieved so far? We have already recovered R15 million of the R64 million, and we already have bills to the amount of R14 million. In other words, the total amount collected and to be collected stands at R29 million. But we received no credit for this, Sir. And we shall continue the process of recovering that money. This is not the end of the matter. In fact, it forms an important part of the legislation before us.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, it is easy to talk about the irregularities that were involved in the spending of this money. We all deplore that. A small handful of people were unfortunately involved and this has caused all the trouble. But as far as the Government is concerned&#x2014; and, after all, it is the Government&#x2019;s action to bring this Bill before the House&#x2014;I think this is completely to the Government&#x2019;s credit. This is the action of a Government that says: I have nothing to hide. These things happen, and before this session of Parliament ends we have to regularize this financial matter procedurally. That is what we are trying to do.</p>

<p>We say now that those moneys that were passed in that way should now be regarded as having been appropriated. That is the main part of that side of it. And it does not in fact go further than that. There is nothing here that says that anything which anybody connected with the Department of Information may have done that might be regarded as irregular or have been found to be irregular, is involved here. We deplore that and we will do our very best to recover any amounts involved, as we have already done. We have put a specialized body in the field to do that, namely the State Trust Board, which will consist of specialists in this field. They will work every day to further protect the assets of the State involved and recover whatever moneys that can conceivably be recovered. And there will be further moneys recovered, as the future will prove. This body is going to be very active, Sir.</p>
<p>So, Mr. President, I say that we all deplore the irregularities that may have occurred as a result of the way in which certain projects were conducted. Many of these activities have been exposed, especially through the Erasmus Commission. But that side of it is not, in all fairness, involved in this legislation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>And I have just given my reply. A straight question and answer. But we can leave that there.</p>
<p>As far as <i>The Citizen</i> is concerned, Sir, let me just say this. <i>The Citizen</i> was being run at a loss. When this became known towards the end of September, October or November last year, immediate efforts were made to ascertain the full facts. The Pretorius Committee played a particularly important part in this respect. Because there were contracts involved and if the matter was not handled correctly there would be millions involved which the Government would be responsible for, it was recommended to us that the best thing to do would be to sell. Until then we did not know that this newspaper had been bought with State funds. The recommendation was to get rid of it as fast as possible in the best interests of the country. It had to be done to stop the current loss and to avoid any claims which we were told would certainly arise as a result of certain contracts running into millions of rands. I am satisfied as I stand here that it was the best decision we could take. It was a Cabinet decision based on the best information that could possibly have been obtained after a very full investigation.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? The hon. the Minister has said that the amount that has been recovered plus what may still be recovered comes to something like R29 million. I think the figure that was involved was R64 million overall, of which it was said R32 million was for <i>The Citizen.</i> Can the hon. the Minister tell me how much of that R29 million that has been recovered comes from the R32 million that went into the financing of <i>The Citizen?</i></p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>No, I am not able to do that, because I do not think this matter has been finally dealt with. The State Trust Board will have to conduct certain further investigations and take certain further actions.</p>

<p>Yes, there was the sale of the <i>The Citizen</i> itself and of certain other assets. However, I am not able to give the hon. Senator a meaningful figure in this regard at the moment.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I am sure that the various clauses of this Bill will be further discussed in the Committee Stage so I shall leave it at that for the moment. I hope I have succeeded in trying to explain in a few words what the real essence of this Bill is. I hope very much that our motives in bringing it forward will not be misunderstood and that it will not now be seen as being part of a wide discussion of an unfortunate affair when in the perspective of the whole matter this is in fact a very narrow issue.</p>

<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>
<p>Clause 1:</p>
<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to repeat something that I said at the Second Reading, namely, that I am opposed to the principle of the Information Service having a secret account. As I said to the hon. the Minister then, I believe that it would serve South Africa&#x2019;s interests best and the information which this service provides about South Africa, of whatever type it may be, would be more readily acceptable to people receiving it overseas if this were done openly and freely without any taint of its having a secret arm attached to it. It should be a department which can be shown to be divorced from any secret activities. Such a department would have far more chance of success in selling South Africa and countering propaganda against South Africa than a department which has a secret arm attached to it I say this freely acknowledging that it is necessary to have secret services handling propaganda for South Africa. I believe sincerely that the proper department for handling that sort of thing is the Department of Foreign Affairs which has the experience, it has the diplomats, it has people who are highly trained in dealing with people overseas. I do not believe that the Information Service is the right body to have a secret fund. I think experience has shown recently that this in fact is true; it should be left to the experts. We found that there were no experts in that department to conduct operations of a secret nature. All I am saying to the hon. the Minister is that I am not opposed to secret services but that I am opposed to this department carrying out those functions. Therefore I oppose the clause.</p>
<p>Clause agreed to (Senator L. E. D. Winchester dissenting).</p>
</speech>
<p>Clause 6:</p>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to put into its correct perspective something the hon. the Minister referred to in reply to the Second Reading debate regarding my question as to when he became aware of the irregularities. I think if the hon. the Minister will take the trouble to read my Hansard later he will find that I said in my speech that he himself had admitted that he had had no knowledge of the secret projects on which certain funds were to be spent. It was as a result of that that I asked the hon. the Minister when he had really become aware of these irregularities. This is precisely the point I was trying to make in my Second Reading speech. The hon. the Minister must have signed authority for certain expenditure without knowing what those moneys were to be spent on. Am I correct? I assume I am correct and this was the point I made. Now we are being asked to regularize action of that sort in clause 6, which refers to the transfers. I have already said that in the first instance my party and I are not to be found for the authorization, whether technically or otherwise, of expenditure of this nature.</p>
<p>Then, Sir, I think I also made the point about the hon. the Minister of Defence who must have been aware in some way or other of the fact that there could have been irregular spending of these moneys, otherwise he would not have objected to these moneys being paid from his Defence Special Account; and, secondly, we would not have had that letter from Gen. Magnus Malan to Dr. Rhoodie in which he stated expressly that he objected to his Minister telling untruths in order to get extra money in a budget.</p>
<p>These are the things the hon. the Minister is asking us to regularize in this clause. It refers to certain transfers, and I say again, Sir, without wanting to waste too much of the time of this hon. House, that I find it impossible to support a clause of this nature.</p>

<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Let us leave that point then. The point is that what I was not happy about was the fact of the transfer of money. Let me just say this, Mr. President: In this matter it was put to me: Here is an all-out effort to try to fight this great onslaught on South Africa. The motive was good. Of that I have no doubt to this day. I was told that in the first place certain moneys would be kept in the Defence Special Account and they would be used by Information as part of the total effort to counter this great propaganda campaign. It was said: This is the system; this has been going for some years; we must continue to keep it secret because there is no Information secret account. It was that that I objected to, and so did the Minister of Defence. I must say that in all fairness as he is not here. That continued for a while and by the middle of 1977 I had made up my mind that that should not continue, no matter how good the aim, but I did not know of <i>The Citizen;</i> I did not know of the big loan to Andre Pieterse and all the things that subsequently came into the picture. But I was not happy about the procedure involving the transfer of funds, and it was because of this that I began to try to discover whether we could not devise a way of bringing in a different system legally. That was why during the next session of Parliament&#x2014;I think it was in the early part of last session; I think it went through the Other Place in March&#x2014;I introduced the Secret Services Account Bill which I think has certainly contributed to straightening this whole matter out under the purview of the Treasury and the audit done by the Auditor-General. I think that is probably all I can say in that regard, Mr. President. That has been my attitude all along.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to ask the hon. the Minister this final question in regard to this matter of <i>The Citizen.</i> He said he was happy that what took place was in the best interests of South Africa; that the sale which took place was in the best interests of South Africa.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">

<p>You mean getting rid of <i>The Citizen</i>?</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes. What I am trying to find out from the hon. the Minister&#x2014;there will not be an opportunity for a long time&#x2014;how much has been recovered from <i>The Citizen</i> to date. Perhaps he could inform this House, and the county for that matter, because the people are vitally interested in this subject. How much was recovered and how was it recovered?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not have that figure with me, and I do not know whether there is a final figure available at the moment. I can check on that and if it is at all possible to help the hon. Senator I can let him know. But I do not have the figure with me now.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise merely to reply to a point made by the hon. the Minister in his reply to me. I just want to tell him that we do not disagree with the Government when it comes to the establishment of an account for secret services. As a matter of fact we fully support it. All that we require is that that account should be properly audited and looked after by people who not only have the authority to do it but also the ability and the training, e.g. the Auditor-General, and this Bill provides for that.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the intentions&#x2014;the hon. the Minister said that he was fully in agreement with the intention&#x2014;the motivations behind the secret fund, viz. to counteract the onslaught on South Africa, the hon. the Minister will know that there is a very true saying which goes something like this: The road to a hotter place than Upington or Kuruman is paved with good intentions! This is exactly what was lacking in regard to the former Department of Information&#x2014;-there was no proper control of the funds.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister is now providing in clause 6 that these irregularities be regularized. Incidentally, Sir, I do not know where the word &#x201C;regularize&#x201D; comes from. I cannot find it in the Oxford Dictionary. It is a verb that seems to have developed a little later than the compilation of the last issue of the Oxford Dictionary. It must be some American slang expression. However, that is by the way.</p>
<p>If I understand the hon. the Minister correctly his intention in clause 6 is to legalize those transfers by passing this legislation. Am I correct?</p>

If I may read something, with your permission, Sir, from clause 2 in answer to something that has arisen under clause 6, I shall be pleased. I do not want to argue the merits of clause 2; I am merely trying to reply to a point that has now arisen.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the object of this clause is to validate certain transactions that have been entered into. Certain actions, settlements and expenditure are involved. I think we dealt with this matter <i>ad nauseam</i> during the Second Reading when we also discussed the question of <i>The Citizen.</i></p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has referred to certain projects that were sound and essential projects during that period. The hon. the Minister mentioned an amount of R29 million which either he had already recovered or was about to be recovered, plus R32 million spent on <i>The Citizen</i>, according to the report of the commission. That already is an amount of over R60 million in round figures. In fact, therefore, not much money was spent on good projects. According to the reports it appears to me that there is an amount of R6 million unaccounted for. When we deduct that, very little remains that was spent on good projects in this whole matter.</p>

<p>I am asking the hon. the Minister to clear up this matter for us. The hon. Senator Dempsey says my arithmetic is poor but I just want to say that I would never have attended his arithmetic classes. I believe he was a professor of economics. It appears to me that one can be a professor of economics without having to have a thorough knowledge of figures. [Interjections.] If he were to read the second report of the Erasmus Commission he would notice, for example, that the hon. the Minister signed a letter of authority involving R14,8 million whereas the schedules attached to that letter provided for approximately R7,7 million only. I prefer therefore not to ask a professor of economics to teach me arithmetic. In any case, this is merely by the way. For the same reason that we could not approve of clause 6 we cannot approve of clause 7. We must vote against the clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I note in clause 9 there is a limitation of three years for the prosecution of anyone referred to in clause 8. I wonder if the hon. the Minister can tell us why there is that limitation of three years? In other words, after three years the people concerned will no longer be liable to be prosecuted. Perhaps the hon. the Minister might tell us if he has any information about any pending prosecutions of certain people. I know it is not in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s province but if he has any information I should be glad to have it.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, just to reply to the last part of that question first, the Police are making various investigations and certain matters have been referred to the Attorney-General. I understand that both of these parties are fully engaged in these investigations and one will have to see what comes out of it. But the Police are definitely engaged in making various investigations.</p>
<p>In regard to the three years, my information is that this was put in here because this is a fairly normal sort of provision in such a case. I am afraid I am not an expert in this regard but should the hon. Senator feel that this is unreasonable I would certainly be prepared to look at it again. The information I have, however, is that the law advisers were of the opinion that this was a reasonable period.</p>

Murder and offences of that sort, of course, never become prescribed; they remain. But 3 years is the rule of the common law in respect of certain offences. They are usually minor offences and some of these visualized here may be very major offences. I should be glad if the hon. the Minister would look at this again.</p>

<p>The impression one gained from the speeches made during the Second Reading was that an attempt was being made by means of this legislation to get away from the Information scandal as quickly as possible. It would appear, as the hon. Senator Van Rensburg has said, that by means of the legislation before us today, we want to bury tee Information scandal and to relegate it to tee past. As a matter of fact, he used the word &#x201C;funeral&#x201D; and then he said we should try to secure the best possible dividends from it. Mr. President, as far as I know there is only one person who receives a dividend from any funeral and that is the undertaker himself. In this case it appears to me that the undertaker is the Government itself. They will probably be the only people who will receive any dividends from this matter. But South Africa itself will not in this way and by means of this legislation be able to rid itself of the blot that the Information scandal has placed on it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the real motives have become evident from the speeches of various hon. Senators. The hon.

He said that as long as this legislation was instrumental in doing that he did not care what it validated or did not validate as long as it helped in putting the scandal behind us.</p>

We shall achieve nothing with legislation of this kind.</p>
<p>During this debate we have heard, <i>inter alia</i>, such terms as &#x201C;to regularize the irregular&#x201D;. On another occasion we heard about &#x201C;wrongs have been done but they have to be regularized&#x201D;.

<p>Mr. President, I rise merely to thank hon. Senators for their contributions during this debate. It is very clear that there is a fundamental difference of opinion between the official Opposition and ourselves as far as this matter is concerned. They are entitled to their point of view just as we are entitled to ours, I suppose, and consequently we shall just have to agree to differ.</p>
<p>If I understood the hon. Senator Oelrich correctly, he said the matter had to be cleared up correctly or properly. I want therefore to put this question once again: If it is not done in this way as far as financial procedures are concerned, how can it possibly be done?

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>As hon. Senators know housing for urban Blacks, as well as for other population communities, is financed from the National Housing Fund. Primarily as a result of policy considerations Black housing was not provided on the same basis as housing for Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics before 1 April this year. Advances from the Housing Fund for the execution of housing schemes for Blacks were allocated only at an eco nomic interest rate, while subsidized interest rates were applicable to the housing of certain lower income cadres of the other population groups. However, housing assistance for Blacks was obtained from various other sources, for example liquor and sorghum beer profits.</p>
<p>A Government resolution that housing shall, from 1 April 1979 be provided on the same basis as the other population groups from the Housing Fund, has meant that new rented dwellings for Blacks with an income of up to R150 per month may in future be provided with money at 1% interest per annum. For the R150 to R250 per month income group, new dwellings will be provided at a rental based on the differential interest rate of 3½% interest per annum. Standards of dwellings and services will in future also be in keeping with those that apply to the other groups, due regard being had of course for the ability of the occupants in question to pay for them. Furthermore it will also be possible to provide community facilities on the same basis in Black residential areas as in the residential areas of the other communities.</p>
<p>In terms of the Housing Act, as it applies at present, the National Housing Commission considers applications for advances by local authorities for the execution of housing schemes for Whites, Coloureds and Indians, while the Black Housing Board considers applications from Administration Boards in respect of housing for Blacks in the urban areas.</p>
<p>The question therefore, arose whether, in view of the elimination of the differences in the basis on which dwellings for Blacks and other communities are being provided, there was any need for the Black Housing Board to remain in existence. I consulted the Minister of Co-operation and Development and he agrees that the need for the Black Housing Board to exist has now disappeared, because we believe that the new dispensation will lead to greater efficiency and uniformity, which will be in the interests of everyone, in particular those of the Black communities.</p>
<p>A member of the Coloured community and a member of the Indian community are already serving on the National Housing Commission where they have a full say in the field of national housing and participate in the decision-making processes in this regard.</p>
<p>If the proposals in this Bill with regard to the abolition of the Black Housing Board are accepted, which will entail that the National Housing Commission will deal with Black housing as well, it will, in my opinion, be desirable to have a member of the Black community serving on the commission as well. Apart from that, owing to the special interests that Administration Boards have in the matter, the Minister of Co-operation and Development and I think that provision should be made for the appointment of another additional member to the commission so that the Administration Boards can also have representation on it. The membership of the National Housing Commission will, therefore, have to be increased by two for this purpose.</p>
<p>The Bill before this House seeks to give effect to the premises that I have tried to outline here. The proposals are, in my opinion, in the interests of better administration and also of better race relations, and I trust that they will meet with general support.</p>
<p>As will be noticed, we envisage putting this legislation into effect on a date to be fixed by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i> The reason for this is that the terms of office of members of the Black Housing Board have not yet expired and that a date for the earlier termination of their terms of office will have to be negotiated with them, after which the legislation will be put into effect. No problems are foreseen in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I listened to the explanation given by the hon. the Minister and I think the Government is really doing something very good here. The Black Housing Board is being abolished and in future everything will fall under the Housing Act of 1966. We also welcome the fact that a Black person will be appointed and that the number of members is to be increased to a minimum of 11 and not more than 14. I think the way the committee is to be constituted is also an improvement. Architects and town planners and so forth will serve on it. The committee will be very well constituted and we support the legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. President, we want to thank the Opposition for supporting this legislation. This side of the House supports it fully and because there is unanimity and so much goodwill, it is not necessary to say any more about the technical aspects of the Housing Commission or to go into the matter in depth. I just want to thank the hon. the Minister for the clear explanation he has given here. I want to express the hope that with the presence of a Black representative on the commission, together with the Indian and Coloured representatives who are already there, all interested parties will now be satisfied that the Department of Community Development has dealt correctly with this matter and has seen to it that there is reasonableness, justice and fairness without respect to persons. We hope that it is a step forward with a view to the better relations and attitudes which we want. We also hope that it will serve as a chain in which we can all participate. We have been convinced once again that the Department of Community Development has immersed itself so deeply in this matter of housing that there is really no weak link in the chain. We support this legislation.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, for the information of hon. Senators I should like to mention that the new format in which the Bill was presented last year proved to be a great success and it is again being submitted in the same form this year as will be the case in future.</p>
<p>Like last year, this enables the Department of Customs and Excise to draft the Bill at a much earlier stage so that the proposed amendments to the text of the principal. Act could be submitted to representative bodies of commerce and industry such as the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, Assocom, FCI and SASAFAA for comments. Comments and proposals were received from these bodies and where practicable such proposals were incorporated in the Bill now before the House.</p>
<p>In terms of the existing definition of &#x201C;manufacture&#x201D; in section 1 of the Customs and Excise Act, 1964, the Secretary for Customs and Excise may in his discretion only determine when the process of packing or measuring off of any excisable goods should be regarded as a dutiable operation. This limitation places a mandatory obligation upon the Secretary to levy excise duty on certain functions&#x2014;particularly in the jewellery trade&#x2014;which should not be regarded as dutiable operations.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this problem clause 1 of the Bill provides for a much wider discretion by the Secretary in determining whether a certain process or function should be regarded as a dutiable operation.</p>
<p>Since the advent of the general sales tax the Department of Customs and Excise has been collecting sales tax on imported goods at the time of entry for home consumption on behalf of the Department of Inland Revenue. Presently section 4(3) of the principal Act debars a customs and excise officer from divulging to the Secretary for Inland Revenue any information regarding sales tax which he may have acquired in the performance of his duties. Clause 2 rectifies this anomalous situation in that a customs and excise officer may, for the purposes of the Sales Tax Act, 1978, divulge information to the Secretary for Inland Revenue or to an officer designated by that Secretary.</p>
<p>Clause 3 provides for the State not to be held liable for any loss or damage sustained due to the wrong delivery of any goods from a State warehouse. As regards this provision I would like to mention that it is not the intention that the Department of Customs and Excise should be protected against wrongful delivery arising from gross carelessness or negligence. The provision is merely intended to absolve the State from liability when goods are released to the importer in good faith against valid documentation and a party with an interest like a bank, claims title thereto and institutes a claim against the Department of Customs and Excise.</p>
<p>Mr. President, clause 4(a) requires no clarification except to mention that the purpose referred to, is whether the goods concerned are being entered for the purpose of payment of duty, warehousing, etc.</p>
<p>I will deal with clause 4(b) together with clause 6, but first I would like to explain clause 5. This clause is a protective measure as far as importers are concerned. Presently, where an importer&#x2019;s goods are conveyed at his risk in all respects, the carrier of the goods is not liable for the duty even where the goods are lost after having been placed in a transit shed under the control of the carrier. This in effect means that the importer will be liable for the duty on such lost goods even though they were still under the control of the carrier. Clause 5(a) provides for the carrier to be liable for the duty under the aforementioned circumstances.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment embodied in clause 5(b) is of a technical nature and will enable the Department of Customs and Excise to act more effectively in cases of tax evasion.</p>
<p>Mr. President, it is well known that South Africa is a member of the Customs Co-operation Council and has for tariff classification purposes given legal status to the Explanatory Notes to the Nomenclature issued by that</p>
<p>Council. One of the council&#x2019;s principles relating to tariff classification is that a member country&#x2019;s customs administration must give binding tariff classifications.</p>
<p>It has for some time been considered that sections 2 and 3 of the principal Act provided sufficient authority for any tariff classification by the Secretary for Customs and Excise to be considered binding. I may add that this was apparently also the opinion of some of the representatives of organized trade and industry who commented on this proposed amendment of the principal Act. In a court case (Autoware (Pty.) Ltd. versus the Secretary for Customs and Excise) the judge ruled as follows regarding the provisions of section 2 of the principal Act&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">In my judgment section 2(1) relates purely to matters of administration, it charges the Secretary with the duty, in the ordinary course of the administration of the Act, to interpret one of its schedules when such an interpretation is necessary: It has no bearing on the jurisdiction of a court which has to resolve a dispute involving an interpretation of the Act or one of its schedules or upon the procedure in such litigation or the rights or duties of the litigants therein.</block>
<p>As regards the provisions of section 3(2) of the Customs and Excise Act I may mention that legal opinion was obtained and it was evident that section 3(2) of the Act equally does not confer the right upon the Secretary for Customs and Excise to make binding tariff classifications. The effect of this situation is that in terms of section 47(1) of the Act importers are in the position where they will be liable for the payment of the correct duties for as long as 30 years after the duty became payable-debts to the State mature after 30 years. Obviously this places not only the Department of Customs and Excise but also importers in a very onerous situation.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment of section 47 of the principal Act embodied in clause 6 will firstly enable the Secretary to make binding tariff determinations. Secondly, in cases where a determination has not been made, importers&#x2019; liabilities for the payment of the correct duties will lapse after two years instead of 30 years. Thirdly, it provides for a tariff determination to be published in the <i>Gazette</i> by the Secretary within 90 days from the date of such determination. In view of this fact and the fact that importers will be in possession of binding determinations it follows that importers will be liable for the payment of the correct duties with effect from the date of such determinations. In cases of <i>mala fides</i> liability for the payment of the correct duty can obviously not be limited.</p>
<p>The fact that the Secretary may make binding tariff determinations in no way detracts from the right of importers to appeal against such determinations and specific provision is made in this respect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Secretary must be in a position to amend a determination even with retrospective effect. It must be accepted that situations may arise where a perfectly valid determination was made based on the information available at that time and that in the light of new information which came to light at a later stage it is found that the original determination should be reviewed. If there is no provision for the Secretary to amend an original determination under these circumstances, the situation may arise where the lack of such a provision is to be to the detriment of the importer in that he might have been paying duty at a higher rate and that he could have been granted a refund of the duty overpaid had such a provision existed.</p>
<p>Mr. President, this is the whole purpose of this provision for the retroactive review of a determination by the Secretary. It is not intended that this particular provision be applied to the detriment of importers&#x2014;the purpose most definitely is a benevolent application in the interests of importers. This is new legislation and where interpretive problems may arise which have merit I will not object to the Secretary for Customs and Excise solving the particular problem administratively until such time as it can be set right in the following year&#x2019;s amending Bill.</p>
<p>I may mention at this stage that the hon. the Minister of Finance personally interviewed representatives from the South African Clearing and Forwarding Agents Association who are of course intimately affected by the provisions of clause 6. They held in-depth discussions and the hon. the Minister listened to their points of view. He also explained to them his viewpoints and the reasons for the proposed provisions.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the provisions of clause 6 are very comprehensive and I do not want to take up too much time in discussing them in too great detail. I would, however, like to mention that there is also provision for the Secretary to publish tariff determinations in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> In view of the amount of preparatory work involved it is proposed that the provisions of clause 6 come into operation on 1 October 1979.</p>
<p>I undertook to deal with clause 4(b) together with clause 6. Clause 4(b) provides for a person entering imported goods to furnish such information regarding the tariff classification of the goods concerned as the Secretary may require. Where an importer has obtained a tariff determination it is important that he should provide the necessary information so as to eliminate any unnecessary delays in clearing the goods. As from 1 October 1979 importers will also be able to refer to the particular <i>Government Gazette</i> in which a determination has been published.</p>
<p>*The comprehensive computerization project which the Department of Customs and Excise is undertaking, necessitates the value of imported goods being expressed in figures to the nearest rand. Clause 7 makes particular provision for this.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment of section 66 of the Customs and Excise Act as contained in clause 8, eliminates obscurities in the existing provisions with regard to the place of export and the expenditure and costs that have to be taken into account in the definition of the normal price of imported goods.</p>
<p>As far as clause 10 is concerned, I should like to explain paragraphs (a) and (b) further. The provisions as contained in clause 10(a) are nothing new to the Department of Customs and Excise or to the petroleum industry. In fact, the provisions of the clause give substance to a practice that has been followed since 1959.</p>
<p>As far as paragraph (b) is concerned, I should like to mention that it happens virtually every year that rebate provisions have to be formulated to assist manufacturers in cases where they have cleared goods with rebate on duty while such goods could in fact not be cleared in terms of the rebate provision.</p>
<p>Up to the present this problem has been solved by including it with retrospective effect in the amending Act of the particular year. Because it is in the interests of manufacturers to rectify matters of this nature as quickly as possible, I propose that the hon. the Minister of Finance be placed in the position to implement the rebate provisions involved by way of notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> with retrospective effect at the time of the formulation of such rebate provisions, where he deems this to be in the public interest.</p>
<p>While I am dealing with the question of retrospective effect, I want to refer again to clause 6 at this stage in order to stress the purpose of the proposed provisions clearly. When one looks at the provisions of clause 6 and clause 10(b), it is clear that their whole purpose is to place the Minister and the Secretary for Customs and Excise in a position to assist importers in certain specific circumstances. I am referring here in particular to the repayment of duty in circumstances for which provision is not normally made in the principal Act The proof that this is the aim we have in mind is contained in clause 13, in which no fewer than five cases of this nature are dealt with. The same phenomenon appeared in the amending Acts of previous years. I want therefore to stress once again that the purpose of these proposed provisions is to render assistance and not to create difficulties, as some persons and bodies interpret it. I trust that hon. members will also view it in this light.</p>
<p>Clause 12 deals with the responsibility of agents who act on behalf of, for instance, importers, exporters, licence-holders and manufacturers. I want to point out at the outset that objections were lodged to the proposed provisions. Basically the objections were in effect that an agent acted by order of his principal and that, instead of extending the agent&#x2019;s liability it should rather be restricted.</p>
<p>The factual position is, however, that &#x201C;importer&#x201D;, as defined in section 1(1) of the Customs and Excise Act also includes a person who acts on behalf of the importer. As the agent receives the rights of the importer in terms of the principal Act, the agent is at present in the position of being able to decide on an arbitrary basis which of the liabilities of the importer he wants to meet. This situation is undesirable because in practice it is the agent who renders the expert service. The agent should therefore not be in the position where he can shirk responsibility for his actions in a specific case.</p>
<p>I should like to point out that in terms of the existing provisions of section 99(1) of the Customs and Excise Act, an agent who acts on behalf of a master; pilot or container operator in a particular case, is liable for fulfilling all the obligations that have been imposed on the particular master, pilot or container operator.</p>
<p>In view of this I cannot see why the agent who acts on behalf of an importer should in any way be placed in the position where he can decide which liabilities he wants to accept and which he does not want to accept.</p>
<p>The Customs Co-operation Council has been giving attention to the question of the liability of third parties for quite some time, and a document with the title &#x201C;Draft Annex Concerning the Relationship Between Customs Authorities and Third Parties&#x201D; was sent to member countries last year for their consideration. The Annex was accepted unanimously by all the member countries on 16 May of this year during the session of the Council in Australia. In this regard I should like to quote the following from the Annex for the information of hon. members&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Principals shall be held jointly and severally responsible with third parties before the Customs for any duties and taxes, as well as for any irregularities and any consequent penalties or fines.</block>
<p>That is exactly what is being provided for in the proposed provisions as far as third parties are concerned.</p>
<p>During the interview to which I have already referred, the provisions of this clause were also discussed thoroughly, and although I agree that only a small percentage of the agents are not always prepared to fulfil their responsibilities towards their clients, this clause is of particular importance. For the vast majority of agents who realize what their responsibilities are, the proposed provisions should create no problems.</p>
<p>Besides the ratification of the amendments which were made before 2 February 1979 in respect of Schedules 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the principal Act, provision is also being made in clause 13, <i>inter alia</i>, for amending the scales of customs and excise duty, as well as the surcharge which was promulgated on 29 March 1979.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Deputy Minister made a few introductory remarks in connection with his first official appearance in this House. I should like to congratulate him most warmly on his introductory speech here and I should also like to congratulate him on his appointment to the post he now occupies. It is a most responsible office. We are engaged with the revision of taxation in the financial sphere in South Africa and we are also engaged in a programme of continued and increasing growth for the future. It is the wish of this side of the House that the hon. the Deputy Minister will contribute his full share to this and that the period of his Deputy Ministership will be a fruitful one.</p>
<p>The legislation which the hon. the Deputy Minister has introduced in this House today is taxation legislation of a very technical nature. All taxation legislation is very technical. But when we come to matters like customs and excise, they are so diverse in so many spheres that it is very difficult to keep fully acquainted with all the technical aspects of the different departments. While I am speaking of taxation legislation, however, I should just like to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that this is the sort of legislation which in its wording and definitions must leave no doubt in the mind of the person reading it as to the interpretation of a clause or a subsection. If that happens one finds oneself in trouble. One can find oneself involved in all sorts of difficult situations such as court cases and so on. That is why we on the Opposition side will always try if matters are not clear to us and if certain definitions are not clear to effect technical amendments which may be of assistance to the hon. the Minister and his department.</p>
<p>I do not want to go further into the various provisions of this legislation except to say that we support it. It is actually legislation which one should deal with in the Committee Stage. The various clauses, as the hon. the Deputy Minister knows, deal with various aspects of customs and excise. I think we should take the Committee Stage directly and then exchange ideas. We support the legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I should like to take this opportunity of welcoming the hon. the Deputy Minister on behalf of this side of the House. Much is said in Parliament, of course, in the respective Houses, but I think that ten or twenty times more is said in the lobbies. When the hon. the Deputy Minister was appointed I did not know him very well because the membership of the NP is very large. But wherever I go I hear people speaking well of him. His appointment is a popular one, he is competent to fill the post and we on this side of the House are pleased to welcome him here on the occasion of the introduction of his first Bill. We wish him prosperity for the future and thank him for the competent way in which he has introduced the Bill.</p>

I want to say that I welcome him to this Upper House on behalf of the Independents. Perhaps he made a small mistake but who does not make mistakes, Sir? He should not be too disturbed about it. Perhaps he is disturbed because in fact he said just the opposite to what hon. Senators on his side said in the previous debate. But that is a matter they can settle among themselves. I wish the hon. the Deputy Minister everything of the best in this very important portfolio and, where previously he had a great deal to do with another matter, I trust he will not find himself in deep water but that he will acquit himself well of his task.</p>

<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>
<p>Clause 3:</p>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in clause 3, page 4, the hon. the Deputy Minister deals with subsection (3) of section 17 of the principal Act. Subsection (3) absolves the State from certain liabilities. At the end of that subsection an amendment is being added, namely&#x2014; or in respect of any loss or damage sustained by reason of wrong delivery of goods.</p>
<p>In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Deputy Minister motivated this amendment, and as a rider he added&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">As regards this provision I would like to mention that it is not the intention that the Department of Customs and Excise should be protected against wrongful delivery arising from gross carelessness or negligence.</block>
<p>The point I want to make to the hon. the Deputy Minister is that although he said this in his Second Reading speech, it is not included in the Bill before us. As I said in my short Second Reading speech, Sir, tax laws should be clear. There should be no doubt as to what the intention is or how the laws should be interpreted. Therefore I wish to move the following amendment to insert virtually the very words that the hon. the Deputy Minister used, namely&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On page 4, in line 18, after &#x201C;goods&#x201D;, to add<br/>: Provided that there has been no negligence on the part of the State or any officer</block>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister-of-finance">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, goods are taken into the State warehouse when some or other legal requirement has not been complied with. That is the point. When some of the requirements are not complied with, those goods are taken into the State warehouse. This is as security to cover any duty which might be due on those goods or to keep those goods in safe custody if they are illegal goods. As I said in my Second Reading speech&#x2014;and I want to repeat this&#x2014;it is not the intention to protect the department against negligence. Mr. Chairman, the State must always be reasonable and if one of its officials has erred, the State will assume liability in all fairness.</p>
<p>Hon. Senators&#x2019; attention is directed to the existing section 17(3) in terms of which neither the State nor any official is held to be liable for any loss or diminution of or damage to any goods in a State warehouse. But this section is never used to protect the department or any of its officials in the case of negligence. I think we must see in this that the State is actually forced to take certain goods into custody, not because of the negligence of the State but because of failure on the part of another party. Now the State, because of the duty to be levied, must take those goods into custody. If the State releases those goods properly against legal documents and a problem occurs later and claims, etc., are instituted, it would in my view not be reasonable to claim compensation. In the first place the State is not responsible for the fact that those goods were in the State warehouse and, should a mistake occur, it would not be fair to expect the State to be responsible for damage to those goods. In the light of what I have just said, I should like to ask the hon. Senator to reconsider his attitude.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, we are well aware of the circumstances under which goods end up in a State warehouse. Nevertheless I do feel that there is a certain responsibility on the State. The hon. the Deputy Minister said this clearly in his Second Reading speech namely: &#x201C;As regards this provision I would like to mention that it is not the intention that the Department of Customs and Excise should be protected against wrongful delivery arising from gross carelessness or negligence.&#x201D; Because the words &#x201C;or in respect of any loss or damage sustained by reason of wrong delivery of such goods&#x201D; is now being added to the subsection, in my view it would only be fair for the hon. the Deputy Minister to reassure importers by accepting the proviso I have moved by way of amendment to this subsection. I do not think that we can relieve the State of all responsibility in this case, notwithstanding the fact that in many cases it is forced to take goods into the warehouse as security or for other reasons. That is not at issue now. The fact that the State must also carry a responsibility in this respect&#x2014;after all, it is only a small responsibility&#x2014;is important. If the State, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, will compensate people in any case, it will do no harm to accept this amendment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened to the hon. Senator&#x2019;s request, but I still hold the view that in the first place such goods ended up in the State warehouse because of the negligence of certain people. This is something to which one must give serious attention. A similar objection was raised in the Other Place and I undertook to have another look at this provision. It is not the intention to protect officials of my department against negligence because that results in inefficiency. The intention of this clause, however, is to protect the State against a <i>bona fide</i> mistake. But I undertake to reconsider this provision and obtain another legal opinion on it. I shall ascertain precisely what the legal implications of this provision are. If it is in fact possible that somebody could suffer loss as a result of negligence on the part of the State, I shall implement the provision in the course of the year in such a way that nobody will suffer. I can then come back to this House next year with an amendment if the legal opinion is such that there may be cases where the State is protected by legislation. Does that satisfy the hon. Senator?</p>

<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in respect of clause 5 I wish to put a question to the hon. the Deputy Minister. Clause 5(a) adds the following proviso to section 44(4) of the principal Act: &#x201C;provided such goods have not been landed and placed in a transit shed appointed or prescribed under section 6(1)&#x201D;. My problem and my question to the hon. the Deputy Minister is whether a container depot is a transit shed. If it is not, I think we will have to amend this clause accordingly. If a container depot is considered not to fall within the ambit of the definition of a &#x201C;transit shed&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 6 constitutes a most important part of this Bill.</p>
<p>†The proposed new section 47(9)(d) provides that&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">The Secretary may whenever he deems it expedient amend any such determination or withdraw it and make a new determination with effect from&#x2014;</block>
<ol>
<li>(i) the date of first entry of the goods in question;</li>
<li>(ii) the date of the notice referred to in paragraph (c);</li>
<li>(iii) the date of the determination made under paragraph (a);</li>
<li>(iv) the date of such new determination; or</li>
<li>(v) the date of such amendment.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is the considered opinion of this side of the House that we should amend this paragraph by adding the words &#x201C;provided that any new determination shall not increase the amount of duty payable, unless a false declaration has been made or false or incorrect information was furnished&#x201D;. We have no problems with this clause if this is the case, but in the case of people who have paid the duty and who have acted above board I think this provision is a bit harsh. I do not think that whenever he deems it expedient the Secretary should be able to amend a determination or withdraw it and make a new determination. If he does make a new determination I think it only fair that provision should be made that the amount of the duty payable will not be increased unless the importer has been at fault. I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On page 6, after line 38, to insert:<br/>: Provided that any new determination shall not increase the amount of duty payable unless a false declaration has been made or false or incorrect information has been furnished</block>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in this regard I wish to draw the attention of the hon. Senator to the proposed new section 47(9)(e) which provides that&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">An appeal against any such determination shall lie to the Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa having jurisdiction to hear appeals in the area wherein the determination was made or the goods in question were entered for home consumption.</block>
<p>This paragraph clearly indicates that the determination is not final and that there is a right of appeal against such a determination.</p>
<p>*I just want to inform the hon. Senator that unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment since there could be other circumstances for which specific provision has to be made in the Bill. In respect of clause 6, I just wish to state that this is a new provision and, as I have already said in my Second Reading speech, the section will be rectified in next year&#x2019;s amendment Bill if any problems of interpretation should arise which appear to be justified. In the meantime the Secretary for Customs and Excise will be able to deal administratively with such cases as do occur.</p>
<p>I also said that the retrospective provision would be applied with great circumspection. I understand the hon. Senator&#x2019;s argument in regard to the retrospective provision.</p>
<p>There are objections to this retrospective provision, but hon. Senators should not lose sight of the legal implications of the legal opinion and the judgment, to which I referred. The legal implications of the judgment and the opinion is that the Secretary for Customs and Excise now has to recover any duty restrospectively for 30 years&#x2014;he now has to recover it retrospectively for 30 years&#x2014;because the period of prescription differs in the case of the State, unless another period is determined by legislation. The proposed provision has this advantage, <i>inter alia</i>, that it limits the actions of the department to a retrospective period of only two years. In cases where a determination has been furnished to an importer, surely it follows that the importer has to apply such determination consistently and if he does not do so, the Secretary for Customs and Excise may and shall recover any duty payable up to the date on which such a determination was made. The question of the retrospective effect in the case where the provisions of the Act have been contravened is in any case as old as customs itself. For example, where an inspector carries out an inspection at present, as in the past, and finds irregularities in the books of an importer, such importer is assessed for a period of two years, and if <i>mala fides</i> is proved, he is assessed for a longer period. Consequently this is by no means a new principle as regards the cases where irregularities can be proved. This is the position as it was, and all that is being added now, Mr. Chairman, is that this power is now without that limitation on irregularities. But the fact is, Mr. Chairman, that the Secretary will not act if there are no serious irregularities, and as has already been said, in general these people are honest, but one must ensure that the legislation has teeth in order to clamp down on those people who cause trouble. This is the background to this provision.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has now given a rather more detailed reply but nevertheless I am still not satisfied with his interpretation of this clause. In the first place the hon. the Deputy Minister referred me to paragraph (e) which reads&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">An appeal against any such determination shall lie to the division of the Supreme Court of South Africa having jurisdiction &#x2026; in the area wherein the determination was made &#x2026;</block>
<p>That is fine. But the point is that one is not really keen to go to court. The hon. the Deputy Minister must have another look at this provision&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">&#x2026; shall lie to the division of the Supreme Court of South Africa &#x2026;</block>
<p>These matters are not cheap. This costs a lot of money. It means that instead of the usual attorney as one&#x2019;s legal adviser or the man to defend one in these matters, one has to employ an advocate, and those people are not cheap. I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister should not accept this amendment. I agree with him that there are people who will deliberately and maliciously contravene the law. We always find that. We find it in many sections of our society but there are also people who import with every good intention and still contravene the law. This Act is not something one should look at lightly. It is complicated legislation and that is why I should like to see this proviso which I have moved as part of this legislation. The backdating of such an agreement could have far-reaching consequences, and I think the hon. the Deputy Minister would really be doing the right thing if he accepted this amendment. If there is not time at this stage of the session to consider such an amendment and to take it back to the Other Place, could the hon. the Deputy Minister not at least give me the assurance that during the recess he will reconsider the position and possibly introduce amending legislation next year. That will reassure the importers.</p>

<p>Suppose the Secretary made some unfair stipulation of an importer. If that importer has supplied false information he does not of course, have a case, and he has to pay; we all agree with that.

He might say to the Secretary: You are making a mistake, that is not a reasonable assessment. If the Secretary does not agree with him that agent has the right to go to the Supreme Court. I know it is expensive but you must remember that the Secretary is not anxious to lose a case in the Supreme Court either. He will try to act reasonably because what reason could the Secretary have for discriminating against an agent who submits facts to him which prove that the Secretary&#x2019;s declaration was wrong? In fairness he can also have recourse to the Minister and say to him: That Secretary of yours, look what he has done to me; here is my proof and he does not want to accept it.

<p>Clause 10:</p>
<speech by="#swanepoel">

</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister-of-finance">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, may I just explain to the hon. Senator that the point of departure in this clause is not really to increase duty with retrospective effect. The matter at issue is the control of fuels as mentioned here. If one looks at clauses 6 and 10(b), it is clear that the objective of the Minister and the Secretary for Customs and Excise is to enable them to help certain importers under certain circumstances. I refer in particular to the repayment of duty in circumstances which normally are not provided for in the principal Act. The proof that this is the objective is contained in clause 13 where no fewer than five such cases are dealt with. The same thing appears in the amending Acts of previous years. This refers to diesel oil etc. for farm use on which a repayment can be made. That is what this is all about. There must be strict control because hon. Senators will understand that if that duty is not paid by the people who should pay it&#x2014;certain hauliers have misused the position in regard to the farm use of diesel, etc.&#x2014;the Secretary must have the right to the collection of that duty retrospectively where there is insufficient proof that that fuel was used for the purpose for which a rebate was allowed. That is what this whole clause is about.</p>
<p>The intention of clause 5 is not prosecution. The hon. Senator will see that five exemptions are provided for in clause 13. These are repayments made by way of legislation. I want to give the hon. Senator the assurance that the whole object is not to prosecute or to punish but in fact to help. But there must of course be proper control, otherwise there will be widespread malpractices and the evasion of the payment of customs and excise duties.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not so sure that we are not talking at cross-purposes. As far as I can see, the Afrikaans text reads better than the English text. It reads: &#x201C;Die Minister kan, wanneer hy dit in die openbare belang dienstig ag&#x201D; amend such a schedule with retrospective effect from the date indicated in the notice. If he considers it to be in the public interest, and he amends the schedule with retrospective effect, it must be stated clearly that the duty will not be increased. That is all we ask. As he has the right to amend it and to make it retrospective, we ask only that it should be stated clearly that there will be no increase in the duty, except, of course, in cases where, as the hon. the Minister has also clearly said, there is a wrongful intent when supplying information or making false declarations. That, of course, is a horse of a different colour. The hon. the Minister has definitely said that it is not the intention to increase the duty. But if that is not written into the Act, the hon. the Minister will also have the right, when he amends a schedule, to increase the duty.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>Last year, in the course of the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Finance when he was introducing the Second Reading of the Sales Tax Bill, he said, <i>inter alia</i>, in his introduction that it was expected that the new tax would be a virile one which would give the fiscal authorities greater freedom of movement to plan a more flexible tax policy and to provide, with the tax revenues which a naturally growing source such as a sales tax can produce without having to increase the rate, the means of attaining those economic, social and educational goals which it was not possible to attain with our then existing limited and overburdened tax sources.</p>
<p>Although we have only just commenced our tax reform programme I am certain that hon. members would like to know how matters stand with the new tax and what has been achieved in the first financial year in which the tax was in force, viz. the period 3 July 1978 to 31 March 1979.</p>
<p>In the first place the administration of the tax, from the outset, functioned unexpectedly smoothly for a new tax, both for the private sector that has to collect the tax as well as my department which is involved in the implementation of the Act. Admittedly there were the birth pains without which nothing can come into existence, and during the first two to three weeks the staff had to be on their toes to solve a host of minor problems. Quick decisions had to be taken, and sometimes incorrect rulings were given which came to light subsequently&#x2014;and are still doing so even at this juncture&#x2014;and had to be rectified.</p>
<p>In the legislation which is now being proposed there are in fact measures&#x2014;which I shall discuss later&#x2014;to afford protection to enterprises in cases where, in those first hectic days, and perhaps afterwards as well, incorrect rulings were given.</p>
<p>The success which was achieved may be attributed mainly to the talks between my department and organized commerce, industry and agriculture which went on for months, the literally hundreds of seminars, meetings, discussion groups, radio and television interviews, etc., in which both the private sector and my department participated, and the co-operation and mutual trust which was created in this way. Even now the Secretary and his department are still adopting an open door policy and there are few days when discussion of a more specialized nature pertaining to particular enterprises do not still take place. Many of the amendments which are being proposed by this amendment Bill, had their origin in these very talks.</p>
<p>When the Standing Commission on Tax Policy proposed the introduction of a general sales tax at the point of final sale, it recommended that the work be entrusted to the Department of Inland Revenue, provided that that department was able to obtain sufficient staff for the purpose.</p>
<p>Owing to the pressing necessity that there be no delay in the tax structure reform the planning was proceeded with and the staff were gradually recruited and trained. Hon. members will understand that it was not possible to recruit officers who could provide guidance from among people without a tax background, and consequently experienced tax officers had to be drawn from other sectors of the department, and their positions filled in turn with less experienced staff. This entailed that experienced officers, who are always a scarce commodity, had to be moved around to cover all activities of the department. In some offices accommodation problems were experienced, and the sales tax divisions had to be housed in other buildings. This is an undesirable practice, but it will gradually be rectified so that the public will be inconvenienced as little as possible.</p>
<p>But owing to the enthusiasm and loyalty of the staff the battle has been won, and I wish to convey to them and to the enterprises in the private sector the sincere thanks of the Minister and the Government as well as my own.</p>
<p>What was the overall result? In the first place hon. members will recall that the estimated revenue from this source, viz. general sales tax, announced by the Minister in his budget speech in 1978 was set at R650 million for the 1978-&#x2019;79 financial year. Criticism was levelled at us from various quarters and we were told that the estimate was hopelessly too low. The final proceeds, unaudited, are R654 million. It ought to be noted that this is an underestimate by the Department of only 0,6%.</p>
<p>In the second place the tax clearly demonstrated what it was capable of, and a further step could be taken in the programme of tax reform, as was clearly reflected in the tax proposals of the hon. the Minister this year.</p>
<p>I am deliberately discussing what has been achieved here. Because it is such an important milestone, I think it is important that hon. members be informed of the functioning of measures established by legislation of Parliament.</p>
<p>The explanatory memorandum on the Bill which has been issued to hon. members and which was made available in manuscript form to the finance groups of all parties some time ago, furnishes detailed explanations of the various amendments which are being proposed in the Bill, and hon. members will not take it amiss of me if I concentrate only on a few matters that justify further elucidation. For the most part the measures in the Bill are aimed at improving the administrative provisions to facilitate even further the smooth functioning of the Act and to eliminate snags which have been encountered in its practical implementation.</p>
<p>The first matter I want to touch on is the question of the effect of the withdrawal of rulings given by the Secretary and his officials in the discharge of their duties in terms of the Sales Tax Act.</p>
<p>The Sales Tax Act has been in operation for just over 11 months. During that period officials had to furnish taxpayers with guidance over a wide spectrum of matters. In some cases it was possible to deal with problems affecting particular concerns by means of consultation with the organization representing those concerns. Normally rulings are given at the request of individual taxpayers and various organizations, and my department does so gladly, because it is of the utmost importance that the taxpayer should have certainty as to the sales tax implications of his transaction. It is also important that rulings be given as quickly as possible in order to prevent the disruption of business. Naturally it is important that the taxpayer should be able to rely on departmental rulings, and for the department it is important that such rulings be complied with. In an imperfect world it is possible that mistakes may creep in in the interpretation of the Act by various persons or that, in the light of subsequent experience, a ruling may appear to be out of step or unsatisfactory and be withdrawn. The opinion is held that the withdrawal of a ruling ought not to have a retrospective effect. From the taxpayer&#x2019;s point of view, he should not be asked to pay additional tax on past transactions. From the department&#x2019;s point of view, tax which was paid in terms of an accepted ruling need not be repaid.</p>
<p>With the objects of certainty and finality in mind, three amendments are being proposed by the Bill in clauses 2, 12 and 13.</p>
<p>Business suspended at <recordedTime time="1979-06-21T18:30:00"/>18h30 and resumed at <recordedTime time="1979-06-21T20:00:00"/>20h00.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>
<speech by="#deputy-minister-of-finance">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I want now to proceed with my Second Reading speech on this Bill.</p>
<p>Clause 2 deals with decisions given by the Secretary to any person&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) to the effect that such person is either required or not required to register as a vendor; or</li>
<li>(b) as to the nature of a transaction concluded by such person.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where the decision is subsequently withdrawn, it shall not retrospectively affect the liability or non-liability of such person for the payment of tax payable or not payable in consequence of such decision. The proposed new provision will only be applicable if the decision was accepted by the person concerned and all the material facts were known when the decision was given.</p>
<p>Clause 12 inserts a new section 26A into the Act which places a restriction on the powers of the Secretary to recover tax retrospectively in the case where he gave a general ruling to the effect that tax was not payable, and subsequently withdrew that ruling. The difference between clauses 2 and 12 is simply that clause 2 deals with particular decisions, while clause 12 deals with general rulings.</p>
<p>Clause 13(b) which amends section 32 of the principal Act, is in certain respects the opposite of clause 12, since it places a restriction on the right of a taxpayer to claim a refund of sales tax where such claim was made more than three months after the transaction or events in terms of which the tax became payable.</p>
<p>If the tax was paid in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time of the payment, no refund may be made. A refund of an amount overpaid as a result of a miscalculation or an accounting or factual error is not being excluded however and the time limit for refunds in such cases remains two years. The opinion is held that the period of three months affords the taxpayer sufficient opportunity to claim a refund as a matter of principle, in contrast to a mere error of a mechanical nature.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, I would now like to deal with a few random matters. I am pleased to be able to say that the inevitable teething problems encountered when the tax was introduced were not such as to cause any radical change in the basic principles originally followed. Traders readily understood how to apply the add-on and add-in systems of tax recovery. Unfortunately, some vendors have been slack about displaying the appropriate notices at entrances to business premises and at points where payments are made. These notices are there to protect the public and it is proposed in clause 6(d) of the Bill, amending section 10 of the Act, to make the failure to display the notice an offence. Certain other similar offences of a technical nature are also created by the same clause. Another offence is created by clause 18 of the Bill, amending section 43 of the Act, which will be committed if a seller knowingly and without lawful excuse includes in or adds on to the price or amount charged to a purchaser an amount of tax in excess of the tax properly chargeable. This is actually an extension of an existing offence, that is, charging tax when no tax is chargeable.</p>
<p>The tax, as hon. Senators are aware, is an indirect tax in that it is normally payable by one person (the seller) and recovered by him from another person (the purchaser or enduser). Usually, with a tax such as the sales tax, the fiscus is primarily concerned with the person who is responsible for paying the tax (the seller), leaving it to the parties to arrange how the seller is to recover the tax from the purchaser. This is an acceptable approach in most cases, particularly where the purchaser is in fact the end-user and the parties have a direct contractual relationship. In some cases, for example, in the building industry, one finds that a subcontractor (e.g. an installer of lifts) is liable for the payment of sales tax on his subcontract. The subcontractor recovers the tax from the main contractor and the main contractor recovers from the ultimate employer; that is, the person who has a building erected. The subcontractor cannot as a rule recover the tax directly from the employer. If payment by the employer to the main contractor or by the main contractor to the subcontractor is delayed unduly, the subcontractor may be embarrassed by having to finance the payment of the tax some time before he has received it. The department has discussed these problems exhaustively with the persons concerned and although further difficulties are not anticipated, it is deemed advisable to give the Secretary a discretionary right to recover the tax directly from an intermediate party or from an end-consumer when the person from whom tax is recoverable by another person has refused to pay or has not paid the amount in question when it fell due, so resulting in a delay in payment of the tax to the Secretary or in embarrassment to the person liable to pay the tax to the Secretary. Cases of this nature will be exceptional and the proposed provisions are to apply where the person from whom the tax is recoverable disputes or does not acknowledge the right of the other party to recover the tax. The Secretary&#x2019;s right to assess and recover the tax is provided for in the new subsection (13) added to section 10 of the Act by clause 6(b) of the Bill. It is not felt that there will be any necessity to proceed under the new subsection (13) merely because a vendor has difficulty in recovering amounts owing to him by a customer under an ordinary contract as it is to be expected that parties will make due provision for the tax and, where payment of amounts due under a contract of sale is delayed, the selling vendor is entitled to relief in the form of a debtor&#x2019;s allowance. Hon. Senators are referred to paragraph 17 of the introduction to the explanatory memorandum in which reference is made to certain other administrative provisions of the Bill.</p>
<p>It will be seen that many of the provisions of the Bill concern various kinds of enterprises. An effort has been made to provide for the trouble-free functioning of the Act in the case of each kind of enterprise, with due regard to the problems of enterprises in that category. Anomalies have, as far as possible, been removed and lists of tax-free inputs allowable to various categories of enterprises have been expanded or clarified. The explanatory memorandum deals fairly fully with the various changes proposed. I might add that all representations received by the department are carefully considered. A request for the granting of any additional tax-free input to any kind of enterprise normally has to be tested by inquiring how the endconsumer is affected. For instance, it is relevant to ask how much tax the endconsumer indirectly bears in respect of the taxable inputs of a manufacturer (as a hidden element of the price) in addition to the 4% he bears on the price of the manufactured goods. An undue escalation is unacceptable but a negligible escalation can, in view of the low rate of the tax, be ignored. Research is undertaken on a continuous basis and changes in the price structure may well result in changes to Schedule 2 to the Act in future. It is not pretended that a state of perfection has arrived, as new problems are continually arising and, of course, amendments will have to be made from time to time.</p>
<p>As is the case in all taxes one must always guard against the whittling away of the tax base by constant exclusions, exemptions and exceptions which might relieve the burden on a particular category of transactions but pass it on to another category. We have in the recent past seen newspaper reports of quite a sharp hike in the value-added tax-rate (VAT) in the United Kingdom from 8&#x00BD;% to 15%. This may be partly due to the need for more tax from this source to counteract the relief given in direct taxes but the high level of VAT can, in my view, also be attributed to the fact that vast areas of sales are zero-rated, thus narrowing the base of the charge.</p>
<p>An important amendment contained in clause 1(d) of the Bill will be found in paragraph (b) of the definition of &#x201C;exported&#x201D;. This provision refers to the case where registrable goods (usually motor-cars, caravans, boats, etc.) are sold under a sale concluded on or after the promulgation of the Sales Tax Amendment Act, 1979, and delivered by the seller to any person in the Republic for conveyance to that person&#x2019;s address outside the Republic. If the relevant law governing registration of such registrable goods does not require that in consequence of the change of ownership occasioned by the sale the goods be registered in the Republic, then no sales tax will be levied in the Republic in respect of the goods.</p>
<p>Clearly, therefore, under the new provisions a non-resident of the Republic will be permitted to buy a motor vehicle in the Republic and drive it across the border under a temporary permit (pending registration in another country), and no sales tax will be payable by him in the Republic in respect of the sale. It must be mentioned here that if the purchaser ordinarily resides in a country which levies a sales tax on imported goods (e.g. South West Africa), he may have to pay sales tax in the other country on the value of the motor vehicle which he imports into that country, but that tax would then be payable in terms of the law of the country in which he resides.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to touch on a a general impression that seems to crop up in the most unlikely places&#x2014;that one can without much effort add a further half or one per cent or more to the tax rate to cover the cost of this, that or the other pet scheme. After all, so the argument runs, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s another percentage point on such a low rate?&#x201D; Let me sound a timeous note of caution. Indirect taxes must be used with the utmost circumspection as they are applied across the board on all consumption expenditure of people from all walks of life, and a one per cent increase represents a 25% rise in the tax rate. It would be foolish to think that in this changing world anything can remain static but I am optimistic that, with a growing economy, a jealous husbandary of our tax resources and greater efficiency of administration as experience is gained, we will be able to improve the yield from this source without necessarily having to increase the tax rate. To achieve this, we must guard against the temptation of seeing the general sales tax as a convenient vehicle for an undisciplined gathering of funds.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Deputy Minister was quite correct in his concluding remarks on this legislation. He gave us a figure tonight of R654 million that was collected by way of sales tax during the months in which this Act was in force, viz. from 1 July to 31 March. In his concluding remarks he said that there would be an increase in the amount which would be collected by way of this tax. If one looks at the revenue estimates for the present financial year one sees that under the heading &#x201C;general sales tax&#x201D; there is an amount of R1 150 million which is a considerable increase. It is not double the amount but it is very nearly double the amount collected during the previous tax year. One must admit that that amount was collected over a period of ten months and that two months have been left out of the reckoning because we had a so-called holiday from the general sales tax.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#senators">
<from>*<person refersTo="hansard">HON. SENATORS</person>:</from>
<p>Nine months.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Was it nine months? All right then. The fact about sales tax is that it is something which feeds on itself. That cannot be helped. The hon. the Minister of Finance referred to this in his budget speech when he said that because of certain factors we had an unsatisfactorily high cost-of-living figure in South Africa. Among those factors he mentioned the introduction of sales tax. If the cost of living rises and if prices rise over a wide front then the sales tax increases on the 4% basis or whatever basis one might determine. That is why I say it is something which feeds on itself. It is therefore not strange that larger amounts will be collected in future by way of this tax. If prices rise and taxes increase, it follows that people will demand higher wages because they cannot come out on their money. In this way more sales tax is collected and so it goes on.</p>
<p>We on this side of the House were always in favour of sales tax. We knew that this new tax which first became effective last year would experience some growing pains. That is why we expected that there would be a considerable number of amendments this year to the Sales Tax Act. As the hon. the Deputy Minister has so rightly said, as we learn from experience in future, there will be still further amendments to the Act to adjust to the practical circumstances of our economic life.</p>
<p>We welcome the fact that there has been a certain amount of adjustment as is evidenced in this Bill. But one thing we in the Opposition can never approve is the fact that certain staple foods which are essential for the lower income groups and the unemployed are also subject to this tax. There are also other basic necessities but let us confine ourselves for the moment to food. This is the one commodity which has consistently risen in price this year because of the fact that the farmers could not have come out if increased price adjustments had not been made in respect of their products. As a result of the increased price adjustments, the price paid for a unit of anything in the line of food increases because the sales tax of 4% is more on a higher price than on a lower price. That is why we have appealed here for differentiation, Sir. The reply we got to our pleas was that we cannot have differentiation because where would it end once it was started. That is the reply we got. But that reply does not satisfy this side of the House. In terms of the old sales duty there was differentiation and it made no difference.</p>
<p>There are only two ways of helping the lower paid section of the population to bear the burden, viz. either by applying differentiation in this case or paying higher subsidies to the consumer to enable him to buy the basic foodstuffs he needs.</p>

<p>Yes, we have the cheapest food in the world. The hon. Senator has helped me and I am very grateful to him. We have the cheapest food if we compare our prices with overseas prices but that is just how that hon. Senator argues and that is why he is sitting on the Nat side of the House. He is a person who has travelled extensively overseas. I want to ask him how wages overseas compare with wages in South Africa. I also want to put this question to him, and he must answer it: What social services does a person overseas get in return for the payment of tax; in other words, for the money he puts into the Treasury, compared with what the taxpayer in South Africa receives? He must not use that ridiculous sort of argument with me, Sir. Let him go and speak to the pensioners and the people who have to exist on a fixed income. Let him go and talk to the unemployed and tell them: You have the cheapest food in the world. Those are the people who do not have the money to pay for that food. He can argue the case with them.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I want to tell the hon. Senator that one should not be so quick to make comparisons as he has just tried to do. I know what the results of cheap food in South Africa are. I know what the results of this have been as far as the depopulation of the platteland in South Africa is concerned. If he approves of that sort of thing he is free to do so. He is a leader in the agricultural industry and occupies a responsible position. If he wants to advance this sort of argument he is free to do so. But I want to warn him that we will experience a social revolution in South Africa if we do not do something quickly and soon about food prices, and particularly staple food prices.</p>
<p>Mr. President, to come back to the Bill, this is the sort of objection we had to the Bill in its original form. Regarding the influence of the Bill on tax reforms and all that sort of thing, we have no objection. We in South Africa are seeking a lower tax rate to bring about greater investment and greater saving, especially among the higher income groups. People who have reached a higher level of productivity should in my view work longer periods in the year and take shorter holidays because the taxes will not worry them. At the same time we are seeking a system which is balanced, a system which will ensure that the poor and lower paid sections of our population will also be able to afford the necessities of life in a country which, as we so often hear, is flowing with milk and honey. It is no good its being a land of milk and honey for one group while for the other groups it is &#x201C;the wet van Transvaal&#x2014;bars en betaal&#x201D;. And in most cases it is &#x201C;bars&#x201D;, Sir.</p>

<p>In regard to the amount of sales tax that it is estimated will be collected in the year ahead, I think the hon. Senator will realize that he made something of a <i>faux pas</i> because in the first place he calculated it on 10 months instead of 9 months.</p>

<speech by="#poorter">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:</from>
<p>If one projects it over 12 months the anticipated increase is 18%. If the hon. Senator Swanepoel had done his homework, he would have realized that we are speaking about 18% and not 100%. However, even that can be ascribed to some things that are looked upon as economic indicators in South Africa, for instance increased employment greater numbers of people being employed, greater spending power, etc. These are some of the things that will contribute towards that extra income. And actually it is a compliment when one realizes that the economy of the country is such that by normal processes, without increasing the percentage of sales tax, we are in fact netting more revenue. That is an indication that in fact the economy is improving.</p>
<p>It is not a question of how much you earn but of how much you are spending. If people are spending money, it means that they are spending it because they have the money to spend and because the economy is enabling them to do so. However, I do not wish to dwell on this particular aspect any longer, because I have a matter of my own which I wish to discuss with the hon. the Minister.</p>
<p>I want to discuss the question of liquid petroleum gas which is taxed in certain cases. I want to reduce the length of my speech as far as possible because I think we are all impatient to get away.

<p>I wanted to say quite a lot about the general sales tax but because of the time factor the hon. the Deputy Minister must please accept as said the many complimentary things one can say about the general sales tax and which should be said. I can only wish him well as time does not allow me to say them.</p>
<p>With regard to liquid petroleum gas, the sales tax gives rise to a price increase which becomes prohibitive in some cases. Instead of using gas people are forced to make use of other sources of energy. Electricity is not taxed and there are three cities in South Africa where the supply of gas is also not taxed. As the law stands at the moment, if gas is supplied by means of a pipeline such as in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, it is not taxed, but if the gas is delivered in a cylinder it is taxed. Restaurateurs and hoteliers who supply us with our meals from day to day are buying gas which is taxed and that tax is added to the price of the meal. Conservatively speaking, if a man uses gas to prepare a meal over a period of half an hour, that meal, at the cost of liquid petroleum gas today, will cost 2c more because of sales tax alone. This is an inflationary tendency. If it was only that, I would be content, but let us look at the anomaly of what happened in Grahamstown. Grahamstown was the fourth city which also supplied gas by way of a pipeline so who bought that gas did not pay tax. Then the contractors discovered that that pipeline was leaking so badly that what they put into the pipeline did not come out on the other side. So what did they do? They changed over to cylinder gas and started delivering gas. Now the consumer, instead of having tax-free gas, has to pay tax. This is an anomaly. When I go further and explain to the hon. the Deputy Minister that within a period of five years we are going to have an oversupply of that very important fuel &#x2026; in this country to the extent of between 23 and 40 million tons, on a worldwide basis, I think I am beginning to indicate to him why I believe that it is necessary for us as a Government to start looking at the healthy propagation of this very important alternative fuel to petrol. I wish to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister in tee short time which I am devoting to this very important subject to take cognizance of the fact that there is this very important alternative energy source, namely liquid petroleum gas, which at the moment represents only 9% of the energy resources we are using but which by projection will have to grow to something like 20% over the next 15 years. This indicates what an important source of energy liquid petroleum gas is to us on a worldwide basis. We in South Africa are going to produce that gas on a very extensive scale with the introduction of Sasol II. It is already a by-product of every refinery in South Africa. Whether they want to or not, they have to produce liquid petroleum gas. I want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister, if he can see his way clear at some time or another, to leave an opening somewhere to ensure that proper attention is given to this aspect over the next three or four months while Parliament is in recess. I am sure that with the kind of motivation I have advanced he will find sufficient reason to treat this appeal with kindness.</p>

<p>Tonight the hon. Senator Swanepoel advanced the same argument, namely that they were in favour of general sales tax but that essential goods should be excluded. That is the same argument which was used in the Other Place. But I have a problem here with the hon. Senator Swanepoel. It is the same problem I had with my good friend, the hon. Senator Horak, earlier today when he said in regard to Venda: &#x201C;We are in favour of everything, short of independence.&#x201D; My problem now is how close to real independence we must stop. I am referring to this because it also illustrates my problem with the hon. Senator Swanepoel. I think it would have lent his argument a great deal of force if the hon. Senator could have illustrated the concept of &#x201C;essential goods&#x201D; by quoting examples. I can easily think of half a dozen things which would fall under this but precisely where do we draw the line? Coffee and sugar are of course essential goods. But now I come to something like a television set In our country there is scarcely a house, even among the less privileged people, which has no television set I should like to know from the hon. Senator Swanepoel if he lists a television set in the category of essential goods.</p>

<p>Absolutely nothing. What is a staple food? In the Free State it is mealie meal, but with us it is something more. That is my problem.

But I leave that matter at that.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel became worked up, even a little upset, when my friend behind me pointed out to him that South Africa has always been one of the cheapest countries in the world.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. C. DEMPSEY</person>:</from>
<p>All right, comparably so. I would not put it so strongly but I would say that even taking into account the wage and salary structure in South Africa we have always been one of the cheapest countries in the world. Unfortunately, I do not have the figures with me tonight because I did not think these arguments would crop up but I remember that we read recently in the newspapers&#x2014;not the Afrikaans-medium newspapers but the English-medium newspapers&#x2014;about that well-known old comparison. The hon. Senator Swanepoel is well acquainted with this. It is also referred to as &#x201C;a weekly wage will buy so much&#x201D;. In those terms the hon. Senator Swanepoel cannot deny that South Africa remains one of the cheapest countries. I do not say the cheapest because that is a dangerous statement There might be a small island somewhere which is in fact cheaper but I say we are one of the cheapest countries. And the hon. Senator Swanepoel must not get excited when that statement is made because it is true.</p>

I want to congratulate him most sincerely. I think he shows great promise for the future. This is a new field for him to a large extent He had, I think, to take up this post at very short notice but he has really acquitted himself of his task as though he were well acquainted with the department and its many functions. It has made a big impression on us on this side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister said in his speech that the new tax was a virile one. Mr. President, when the hon. the Deputy Minister speaks of virility then he is in the right place. There is no doubt about that We know all about that and we agree with him that the new tax contains some special features. This has already been shown by the anticipated revenue for the new financial year. I cannot help referring too to the very accurate estimate which was made. It is almost unbelievable that the hon. the Minister together with his senior officials could have been so close to the mark with the anticipated revenue from this new source, particularly when it is a new sphere.</p>
<p>This brings me to one special point which I feel I must raise here this evening. We are a young country&#x2014;many probably regard us as a little backward&#x2014;but if we do try something new we do it with great thoroughness. I think now of the introduction of the metric system some years back We did this in such an advantageous and successful way that it served as a model in later years for many other countries. There were very few drawbacks or crises in that regard and the introduction of this sales tax has often reminded me of that Very few drawbacks became apparent in the course of that system. This is proved by the fact that the hon. the Deputy Minister has come here this evening and introduced a Bill which really contains very few amendments. There are essential amendments here and there, but it really proves one important thing, viz. that the officials and the Minister have made a very good job of it.</p>
<p>I want to conclude by paying tribute this evening&#x2014;and I am sorry the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot take credit for this because he was not there then&#x2014;to the hon. the Minister and particularly to Mr. Van der Walt and his senior officials. Incidentally, I know how hard they have worked, not only during normal working hours but over week-ends and at night to prepare this sales tax and the Bill which followed for introduction about a year ago. They did their work so well that I think we owe it to them tonight to pay tribute to them and to thank them for their excellent achievement.</p>

<p>No, wait, I stuck my neck out when the original legislation was introduced here and I voted with the governing party. I did have the assurance of the hon. the Minister of Finance that this additional revenue would be used for all sorts of purposes, including the improvement of social services and the position of the less privileged people. At that time I made an appeal to the hon. the Minister that before he introduced his budget, this year&#x2019;s budget, he should carefully consider the payment of subsidies on essential foodstuffs. I find it very difficult to understand why the hon. Senator Dempsey does not know what are absolutely essential foodstuffs. What is the position in regard to our Black population? I do not think I am wrong when I say that their essential foodstuffs are mealie meal and mealie meal porridge. They have now also started to eat bread. I admit that in his budget the hon. the Minister of Finance has appropriated an additional amount of R20 million as a subsidy on bread. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister of Finance picked me out the other day because I said only R20 million. I hear the hon. the Minister of Agriculture also mentioning only that figure. I corrected myself and said it was an additional R20 million.</p>
<p>I want to say to the hon. Senator of wool fame that one cannot live by bread alone. What must one regard as absolutely essential foodstuffs? Where is the leader of the health group on that side?

<p>I should like to know, Sir, how this additional revenue will be spent. I say the Government is wasting money because they spend more than R19 million combating tuberculosis while they only spent R7 million in the form of subsidies on dairy products in the past. That account for combating tuberculosis could therefore have been halved. I gained the impression that the hon. the Minister of Finance would carefully consider my suggestion but he did not consider it at all. Why do we have the cheapest food in the world?</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Sir, I come back to the sales tax. The fact is that the revenue from this tax will be still greater in the coming financial year because the price of food has risen by 15%. You know what the implications of this are, Sir. The figure will be much higher than the estimate of the department of over R1 050 million. I think it is going to be much higher because food prices alone have risen by 15%, something the people are objecting to most strenuously. What is the major problem? The problem does not lie with the Government which introduced the sales tax. Who gets the blame? The farmer of South Africa. No concessions are made in the sales tax system for the farmer of South Africa. A few exceptions are made in regard to fuel, fertilizer etc. but in any case the price of those articles has risen sky high and the concessions really do not amount to much as far as food production costs are concerned. There are so many other things which are essential to the farmer and upon which sales tax is levied. These are all things which send the farmer&#x2019;s capital investment rocketing. What is the position regarding new implements? I bought an implement the other day on which I had to pay sales tax. The ridiculous part is that when I have to buy parts for that implement, those parts are free of sales tax! I am registered as a farmer. I have my registration number. [Interjections.] Would the hon. Senator of <i>Vader-land</i> fame like to put a question? I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give attention to this matter. I realize the difficulty the Department has in making too many exceptions. But I do feel that the hon. the Minister should look again at the question of sales tax on essential goods, goods which are not only essential in the direct production of food but which call for capital investment Those implements are necessary to enable the 70 000 farmers to produce more food.</p>
<p>Take the question of barbed wire and iron posts. In my part of the world we are engaged in a new grazing programme and we need a great deal of barbed wire and iron poles, on which we have to pay 4% tax. As a result the price of red meat has risen sky high, but it is still 25% lower than three years ago. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister and his staff will give attention to this matter. The farmer&#x2019;s capital investment in specific cases should also be exempt from sales tax. A golf club can buy a machine to eradicate weeds but I have a certificate to say I am a farmer &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. President, if I were to be very specific, the ladies would blush. You know, Sir, I have a young wife! It says a lot that I have a wonderful 18 month old daughter.</p>
<p>In a more serious vein I want to say that I appreciate the difficulties of the department in making exceptions in those cases. As I say, a golf club can probably buy a machine for R700 or R800 to eradicate weeds, but they do not have a certificate of exemption while as a farmer I have one. If the hon. the Minister and his staff do not believe me they can always make inquiries to find out what the situation is. I make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider exempting those important items which encourage food production. It is a fact that the farming industry does not have a big profit margin. The farmer gets 6% on his invested capital&#x2014;as the Americans say: &#x201C;2% is in hard cash and only 4% in pleasure.&#x201D; If the hon. the Minister is going to take another 4% we shall find ourselves in difficulty later. The farming industry does not have the wherewithal to build up capital. This is a difficult position and I really do hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister and his staff will give attention to the matter. We do not expect a definite reply tonight but we hope things will be better for us next year.</p>

<speech by="#deputy-minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, they also mentioned essential goods. Let us deal with the argument of the hon. Senator Du Toit in regard to basic foods. Once one begins to make exceptions in regard to general sales tax, one finds oneself in difficulties because the first point we must remember is that the dealer who has to levy that tax starts encountering difficulties. He is, as it were, an official of the Department of Inland Revenue. He collects our tax. We expect that man to have the ability to be able to differentiate. Say, for instance, he does not pay tax on bread and mealie meal, but it has to be paid on cake flour. He pays on one but not the other. Apart from placing a heavy burden on the dealer, one is also opening the way to misuse. Now we make it easier for malpractices to occur.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>

<p>Oh yes, we know that!</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>The chain stores also sell it Now one starts to mark the goods but that man has to be controlled in respect of his total turnover. Now the Receiver of Revenue has to go even further. He must try to determine what quantity of basic foodstuffs has been sold because this man&#x2019;s tax does not look right In the Other Place the argument was advanced that certain persons&#x2019; turnover suddenly declined. This aspect is being looked into but one does not want to complicate this matter further.</p>
<p>I want to say further that the Secretary for Inland Revenue was sent overseas and he made a very comprehensive study of the two systems. One system is applied in the United Kingdom, namely, the value added tax. In the United States they also have a form of sales tax. In both countries it is said that when tax is levied on a commodity basis serious problems are encountered. We have just started this system and if one makes it so complicated right from the beginning by bringing in those things, then the whole thing will become too involved. One makes it unnecessarily complicated and creates an opportunity for people to abuse the system.</p>
<p>For the sake of the record I should like to say something about basic foods which has been raised by hon. Senators. From time to time emotional pleas are made for the exemption of basic foods from general sales tax. Let me put it this way&#x2014;and I shall prove it&#x2014;that the Government is not unsympathetic in regard to this matter. On the contrary; the Government has a great deal of sympathy for the under-privileged people of this country. Constant attention is given to their needs. We can be judged by our record. Subsidies are built in to the maize price so that the price to the consumer is subsidized because the Government pays for the storage of the maize. Bread is subsidized. We have a national housing scheme in terms of which we look after the interests of the poor man in respect of housing. Hospital fees are paid according to the income of the individual. We have a good record as far as the protection of the interests of the less privileged people in this country is concerned. The hon. Senator Dempsey showed most competently what precisely basic foodstuffs were. Nobody can define them but vague reference is made to bread, maize products, milk, meat, eggs, etc. Some people go further and say fish, cheese and fruit are also basic foods. The argument can be advanced that a child can only live on yoghurt, which will then make that a basic food. In the same way one can take, for instance, milk or cream, and then such a person will say that powdered milk should also be exempt from the tax. When one begins with this sort of thing one makes things very difficult.</p>
<p>Another argument which is often raised is the rich/poor situation. The poor people have to pay the 4% sales tax and the rich people also pay only 4%. We must be very careful that we do not talk about this too much in this country. You all know what I mean. We can be honest with one another in this matter. It is a delicate matter. We must not ride that horse because it will throw us.</p>
<p>Regarding this question of sales tax which is imposed over the whole spectrum, the point of departure is to bring about a more balanced tax system in South Africa which will be to the good of all sectors. The too-high marginal income tax scales must be reduced to encourage the job-providing entrepreneur to expand and provide employment. On the other hand, this increasing tax will provide the means whereby further training, social and tax benefits will be available to the lower income groups.</p>
<p>Mr. President, when in South Africa we talk about this rich-poor situation, the impression must not be created that the Government is granting tax concessions to the higher income groups. That is the goose which lays the golden eggs. We live in a free capitalistic country, and we must not kill the entrepreneur in the country because he provides work for the poor. They help the country to grow, they make it big and strong.</p>

<p>That is just what I say but now we are criticized in some quarters because the poor man has to pay sales tax while the rich man&#x2019;s marginal scales are reduced. Those are dangerous arguments.</p>
<p>In the recent budget the threshold for liability for income tax was raised from R1 200 to R1 500 for married persons under 60 years; that is, by 25%, and for persons over 60 years, from R1 900 to R2 500, that is, 31%. For Black people the threshold has also been raised from R360 to R1 200. As the threshold for Black people as well as for Whites has been raised, it is reasonable that sales tax should be paid by all.</p>
<p>Sales tax is not a commodity tax but a tax on a transaction by which movable property is obtained by an end user or an end consumer. The collector is the dealer. It is the cashier at the cash point who would have to identify goods if a selective tax were introduced. When a housewife buys her household needs, the cashier would have to distinguish between the taxable and nontaxable goods and do a double cashing-up, so that at the end of the day there would be a distinction between taxable and non-taxable sales. This involves administrative problems thereby entailing further costs for the dealer to a far greater extent than under the present system.</p>
<p>Then there is also this question: How is basic food described? Firstly, it must be remembered that the most important staple foodstuff, viz. bread, is subsidized to counter the effect of the sales tax. But supposing bread is exempted from sales tax&#x2014;and there are hundreds of sorts and forms of bread&#x2014; must only that which is defined be identified by the cashier? That is the problem, Sir. There is a large assortment of bread. Some maize products are used for puddings and gourmet foods. Must everything now be exempted?</p>
<p>Milk is also found in various forms. All of it is edible, but must all forms like yoghurt, flavoured milk, surrogate milk powder, etc. also be exempted? These are the questions we shall have to answer. Which cuts of meat should be exempted?</p>

<p>If only shin were to be exempted, it is certain that 90% of a butcher&#x2019;s turnover would suddenly be shin. That is what would happen, Mr. President.</p>
<p>I could go on like this for hours but the basic principle which must be remembered is that as soon as the basis of a tax is lowered the scale has to be increased to realize the same eventual return.</p>
<p>I should like hon. Senators to listen to the following. A study by the Bureau of Market Research of Unisa showed that a Black who earned R1 272 a year spent on an average only R275,11 or 20% of his total income on food.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">

<p>R1 272 a year or for how long?</p>

<speech by="#deputy-minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>A Black who earns R1 272 a year spends R275,11 on food&#x2014;that is according to Unisa&#x2019;s survey; these are not our figures&#x2014;namely, 20% of his total income. What is more important is the fact that only R126,80 relates to those commodities which could be regarded as the so-called basic foods. So about half of that R275 is spent on basic foods. [Interjections.] The hon. Senator must listen to me first and then do his reckoning later.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister is talking now of basic foods. What is the definition of basic foods?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>But the hon. Senator said he knew what it was and there should therefore not be any confusion about it now. He has just told me what the basic foods are. Unisa gave a definition of basic food and mentioned, <i>inter alia</i>, bread, flour, etc. as examples. It is easy to decide for oneself what basic foods entail but as soon as the Receiver has to decide what food has to be taxed and what has not to be taxed, problems arise. As I have already said, only R126,80 is spent on the so-called basic foods and the tax on those foodstuffs will thus be R5,07 a year or 42 cents per month of that person&#x2019;s expenses. Hon. Senators have asked for basic foodstuffs to be exempted from tax. But for a man who earns R1 272 a year it would mean a rebate of 42 cents per month. This person would get a rebate of 42 cents per month but the shopkeeper who sells him a loaf of bread every day and has to keep separate accounts for exempted and taxable goods may have to pay out 80 cents a month because of the extra bookkeeping he will have to do.</p>
<p>I want to make an earnest appeal therefore that if one really has the interests of the less privileged people at heart, one should ask for the improvement of their living standards by the payment of a living wage rather than to become emotional about what might be a minute addition to expenses in the form of sales tax. An increase in the administrative costs of the dealer has to be avoided at all costs so that he does not have to raise his prices.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I should like to thank the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter again for the kind thoughts he expressed about me. The hon. Senator spoke about gas which is taxed, i.e. gas sold in cylinders and bottles, and also other gas which is supplied by pipeline and is not taxed.</p>
<p>†Mr. President clause 4(1)(e) of the Bill amends section 6(1)(d) of the Act and the amendment reads, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">the sale of electricity, gas or water when delivered to purchasers &#x2026;</block>
<ol>
<li>(i) in the case of electricity, through mains, cables or lines;</li>
<li>(ii) in the case of gas, through mains or pipes;</li>
<li>(iii) in the case of water, through mains, pipes, furrows or canals or from tankers or in barrels or drums &#x2026;</li>
</ol>
<p>is exempt from sales tax.</p>
<p>As far as the sale of electricity or gas is concerned, the exemption is clearly designed to apply only where electricity is sold to consumers by such undertakings as municipal power stations, Escom etc. or, in the case of gas, by undertakings such as municipal gas works.</p>
<p>In the case of farming enterprises, that is, where farming or forestry operations are carried on, the exemption from sales tax contained in paragraph 6 of Division IV of Schedule 2 to the Act, refers, <i>inter alia</i>, to gas purchased in bulk supply and intended to be used directly in the production of farming or forestry products.</p>
<p>Although the principle of neutrality is observed as far as possible when it comes to manufacturing or production inputs, it is not possible to preserve neutrality as between the sale of electricity and the sale of gas to consumers by providing an exemption in respect of the sale of gas in bottles or cylinders where the gas so purchased is intended to be used for domestic purposes such as cooking, lighting or heating, because gas in bottles or cylinders is usually distributed through retail outlets, that is, over the counter, in the same way as groceries are sold in a grocery store.</p>
<p>In the circumstances I regret that I cannot accede to the hon. Senator&#x2019;s request but I will ask the Secretary to go into the matter again during the recess. I am also prepared to listen to the hon. Senator if he wants to address me on the question of liquid gas.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, I agree with the hon. Senator that we shall have more gas at our disposal in time and therefore we are prepared to reconsider the question of gas as a source of energy.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dempsey also addressed some kind words to me which I do not deserve but I want to tell him that I appreciate this very much. He gave us a very good explanation of the crux of the problem in regard to so-called basic foodstuffs, i.e. that it is a question of the description. I agree&#x2014;I think we all agree&#x2014;that food prices in South Africa are among the cheapest in the world if one takes everything into account, e.g. salaries, etc. As far as living standards are concerned, it is a fact that circumstances in South Africa are favourable. In terms of the norms and yardsticks which the hon. Senator advanced, e.g. how many hours one has to work for a pair of shoes, it is clear that we must be grateful for the fact that we live in a country like South Africa. I want to associate myself fully with the hon. Senator&#x2019;s words of thanks and congratulation to the Secretary and to the department for the exceptional measure of success they have achieved with the introduction of the general sales tax. During the first year it was such a success that they were only 0,6% out in their estimate of the revenue to be derived from the tax. We want to thank the department for the very good work they have done in this connection.</p>
<p>As far as the hon. Senator Du Toit is concerned, I have already partially replied to his request that there should be subsidies on essential foodstuffs. But he made a statement which I would not have made. He may have been in politics longer than I have but I think he made a mistake when he said that we spend too much on tuberculosis and too little by way of a subsidy on milk. I do not think one should put it that way. Does the hon. Senator maintain that we should spend less on the fight against tuberculosis?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I am pleased that that is not what the hon. Senator meant but it rather seemed to me as if he did say that. Nevertheless, I want to tell the hon. Senator that I think the Government is doing its duty as far as the fight against tuberculosis is concerned. This is a serious matter and one which should be approached with a large measure of responsibility. I should not like to say more now about the question of combating tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator also mentioned sales tax on new farm implements. Reference was also made in general to farming activities and, because this is a very real problem, I should like to say something tonight about farming purchases and means of production. I shall not take up too much of the time of the House in this respect.</p>
<p>One of the most important administrative objectives of the system of general sales tax is to prevent as far as possible a tax on a tax; in other words, that the price and therefore also the tax which the end consumer has to pay is increased significantly as a result of tax which manufacturers and others have to pay on inputs by them in the manufacturing or production process. This means simply that if the input bears tax which results in the price increasing to such an extent that the tax which the end consumer has to pay is significantly higher, we shall have to look at that matter again.</p>
<p>Although in many cases it will be difficult for the farmer to pay tax which he has to pay by way of price increases to the consumer and, strictly speaking, there is thus less chance that there will be an escalation in the net amount of tax paid by the consumer in respect of the purchase of farming products, it is nevertheless accepted that increased production costs, as a result of the taxation, could have an adverse effect on food production. Therefore provision has already been made in Section IV of Schedule 2 of the Act that farmers can purchase almost all their means of production tax free. It must be noted that not only the basic input, i.e. seed, fertilizer and cattle feed can be so purchased but also a wide range of other means of production in respect of which it has been decided in consultation with organized agriculture that the use thereof would have a marked effect on production costs. If there are certain items which are not mentioned in the list which might also have such an effect, organized agriculture is at liberty to bring these to the attention of the department and serious attention will certainly be given to the matter. It must however, be emphasized that only those items in respect of which the unit cost would in fact increase the price of a product significantly will be considered. Capital goods like tractors, combines* etc. do not qualify for consideration in this respect. Spread over the period of use of those items as well as the volume of production the tax paid at the time of purchase has only a very minimal effect on the unit costs of the products which it helps to produce.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Act empowers the Minister of Finance to amend the schedules by way of notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> at any time when Parliament is not in session. If it can be shown therefore that any item not in the list of goods which may be purchased tax free should be included, the Minister can immediately take steps in that connection.</p>
<p>I must say very clearly and expressly here that we are prepared to listen to such representations which can be substantiated. I think I have replied to all the hon. Senators.</p>
<p>Question agreed to.</p>
<p>Bill read a Second Time.</p>

<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>
<p>Clause 4:</p>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, solely for the purpose of clarity I should like to move amendments to this clause. I refer to clause 4(1)(i) on page 12. I propose here that we accept different wording at the end of the paragraph instead of the amendment contained in the Bill. We referred to the idea of this amendment last year when sales tax became law. The idea was that where someone transferred a business to somebody else and retained certain of the assets for himself, e.g. the building or vehicles or whatever assets he chose to retain, sales tax should only be paid on the assets which he disposed of and not the assets which he retained for himself. As the old Act read it could be interpreted that the purchaser had to pay sales tax on everything, including the buildings and other assets, whether they were retained by the original owner of the business or not What does the clause now try to do? The object of this paragraph is really to exempt the assets retained by the original owner from sales tax. But the wording of the proposed amendments by means of which those retained assets will be exempt from sales tax is such that I have had various representations to word them more clearly. I am not giving my own opinion on this matter; I am relaying the opinion of representations made to me by people who say that as the Bill reads at present it is not clear whether those assets which the original owner or the seller retains for himself should be exempt or included. I find this particularly in so far as the English text is concerned. I therefore wish to move the following amendments&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(1) On page 12, in line 54, to omit all the words after &#x201C;thereof&#x2019; up to and including &#x201C;approve)&#x201D; in line 57;</li>
<li>(2) on page 12, in line 58, after &#x201C;concern&#x201D;, to insert:</li>
</ol>
<block name="quote">:Provided that any fixed property or book debt, or any other asset which the Secretary, having regard to the circumstances, may approve, shall be excluded</block>
<p>I think if we make that change the position will be much clearer and cause far less confusion than the present amendment proposed in the Bill. It is the same idea. We do not differ with the idea expressed here. It is just a question of wording. According to representations made to me the amendment in the Bill is not clear and people are not sure what is excluded and what is not excluded. Accordingly in pursuance of my earlier representations to the Minister I want to say that in taxation legislation one must be able to so read the Act in such a way that there will be no doubt as to its interpretation. It is pursuant to that I have moved these amendments.</p>

<block name="quote">in the case of gas, through mains or pipes.</block>
<p>When one looks at subparagraph (iii) one sees that water from tanks or in vats or drums is included. It so happens that in the agricultural sector the farmer as a registered entrepreneur makes use of gas. Unfortunately, he cannot make use of tanks, etc. but he does make use of large containers. We think of the farm where a welding machine is used which uses gas*. The hon. the Deputy Minister is also a cattle farmer and he knows we also use gas for dehorning animals.

<p>The fact that the assets mentioned are not included in the sale does not disqualify the purchaser from exemption in respect of other movable assets where an undertaking is purchased as a going concern. That is so. I can tell the hon. Senator further that buildings are not goods and are not taxable. The proposed paragraph (j) is an exemption in respect of all the assets which are sold when a business is sold as a going concern. The exclusion of fixed property, etc. simply means that where such property is excluded from the sale of a business, the exemption will not be lost. The hon.

I do not think there is much merit in the argument that we are making too many exceptions because exceptions are made, even in the case of gas. If the farmer, the entrepreneur, shows his certificate&#x2014;the number appears on the invoice&#x2014;is that not sufficient proof that he wants to use the gas for agricultural purposes? That is why I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister if he did not trust the farmer. There may be farmers who would use that gas for household purposes.

<p>We listen a lot to stories about red meat, Mr. Chairman. I just want to solve this problem. There are two ways of selling gas. One is by way of a cylinder which the person hires; in other words, he pays a deposit on it; he uses the cylinder of a company like Shell or Mobil or one of the other companies. He does not buy the cylinder but he buys the gas which is in it. If the person has an exemption certificate, the gas in that cylinder is free of any tax. If the person buys his own cylinder and goes to a dealer and says &#x201C;Fill my cylinder, please; this is my own cylinder,&#x201D; and it is smaller than 9 kg, e.g. 4 kg, then he must pay tax.

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is a very involved and technical clause and I want to refer to Division IVA. Paragraph (d) deals with the felling of trees. If the hon. Senator on my left here hires people to shear his sheep, he does not pay sales tax on that, and if I get people to fell trees on my farm, that is also free of sales tax. But that is an outdated idea. These days we use tractors and so on to uproot trees, and it has precisely the same end result. Will there also be exemption in this case?</p>
<p>In paragraph (n) of Division IIIA all sorts of terms are used where machinery etc. is attached to tractors.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, let me reply to the hon. Senator this way: The principle at issue here is that a service performed as a contribution to the production of something is free of tax because that escalates the tax. This also applies too to the shearing of sheep. That is a service which is regarded as a contribution to production in the production of wool. Accordingly no sales tax is payable on that shearing service. If one uses a tractor or something else to fell trees, it is a capital outlay and one pays once on the purchase of that capital asset. The 4% which is paid is of course spread over the lifespan of that implement and the volume of work which the implement performs. It therefore has no significant influence as a contribution to production in that case.</p>
<p>As far as attachments to machinery are concerned, I shall ask the Secretary to inform the hon. Senator in writing on this. It is a technical matter.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I rise just to say from this side of the House that I thought this was a really interesting debate. It was interesting in the sense that it showed once again the versatility of hon. Senators on the NP side. In this I include the hon. the Deputy Minister. I do not want to exclude him from such a compliment.</p>
<p>I listened with great pleasure this evening to people who did not know what basic necessities were and what staple food was and so on. In all honesty I must say that I find the adaptability of hon. Senators opposite very striking. I have here the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Fiscal and Monetary Policy in South Africa, a report brought out by Dr. Franszen in 1968 which led to the Sales Tax Act of 1969 as we know it today. Sir, do you know what that report says? I just want to read one single recommendation from the conclusion to which this commission came. I quote from paragraph 175&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">Met the oogmerk om so &#x2019;n klein moontlike bykomende las op the laagbesoldigde groepe in die gemeenskap te plaas en om so &#x2019;n groot moontlike gedeelte van die totale belastingopbrengs van persone in die hoër inkomstegroepe te verhaal, het die Kommissie besluit om daardie bestedingsposte, wat &#x2019;n betreklik groot deel van besteding van die laer inkomstegroepe uitmaak, met geringe uitsondering geheel en al van verkoopbelasting uit te sluit.</block>
<p>Sir, do you know what the reaction was of hon. Senators on the other side of the House? They were in complete agreement with this.</p>

<p>They are versatile.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Yes. This evening they find it difficult to exclude these matters. They find it quite senseless of this side of the House even to make a proposal like this. Where, says the hon. the Deputy Minister, are you going to begin and where will you end? What does one do in the case of bread? Which sorts should be included and which sorts should be excluded? We have already had this sort of tax and there was differentiation. How did the dealers succeed in differentiating among the various kinds of bread? There was no tax on food. Let us begin with the definition of what these necessities of life are because the hon. Senator Fick wants to know. [Interjections.] These are not my definitions; they were given by a professor and his commission and he can accept them. He accepted them in 1969. [Interjections.] They are food, rent, instalments on homes, insurance, repair and maintenance costs of homes, water, sanitary services, removal of refuse and a number of other items. [Interjections.] We are not asking for the exclusion of things such as light, water, etc. All we ask is a differentiation in regard to our basic and essential foodstuffs. The same NP which introduced the sales duty in 1969 found a way of making all these exceptions but cannot find a way to make a few exceptions now. That really surprises me. It seems to me that the more time that passes the less the NP are in a position to do anything. [Interjections.] We are becoming all the more easy going. You can see that I am too. But I am nonetheless prepared to do something for the poor man, which hon. Senators do not want to do. I think that replies to the argument of my friend the hon. Senator Dempsey.</p>
<p>So I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that he must be careful with these old out-dated expressions which we find in economics, such as one-time rises and that sort of thing. He should not use them too freely. A one-time rise in the cost of living is not what sales tax is causing in South Africa. I think I have already tried to indicate this to the hon. Deputy Minister. If there are tariff increases, such as is the case of the Railways or in the case of the Electricity Supply Commission or even of Iscor where there was a rise in the price of steel, then one can speak of a one-time rise. However, as I said at the start of my speech, this tax feeds on itself. A rise in prices brings with it a rise in the revenue from this tax. I was surprised that the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter, for instance, said that this shows the growth in the economy. The fact that there will be an increase in revenue from sales tax does not necessarily point to growth in the economy. There can only be a rise in the cost of living and that in itself will automatically result in an increase in revenue obtained from this tax.</p>
<p>†As a matter of fact, Mr. President, this is what we had last year, namely a situation of stagflation, when there was a small growth rate but the cost-of-living figure was in excess of 11%. That is one of the reasons why there was an increase in the amount of revenue collected by way of the sales tax. Let us, therefore, not bluff ourselves, Sir.</p>
<p>*It is not a one-time increase. It carries on and flourishes progressively on its own.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#dempsey">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. C. DEMPSEY</person>:</from>
<p>It is not a tax on tax.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Sir, perhaps it is not a tax on tax. I have never said it is a tax on a tax. With respect to the hon. Senator who was a lecturer in economics, the allegation that if it is not a tax on a tax it is a one-time increase, has never in my view been a definition of a one-time increase. This is a tax levied on the end price of a product and if that end price is higher it follows of necessity that the tax will also be higher. That cannot be a one-time increase. The hon. Senator wants to ask a question.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#dempsey">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. C. DEMPSEY</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, may I put the following question to the hon. Senator Swanepoel? The hon. Senator says that as inflation increases so the tax will also increase.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Of course.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#dempsey">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">W. C. DEMPSEY</person>:</from>
<p>Will the hon. Senator concede that parallel to the increase in inflation there is also an increase in wages and salaries to compensate for that increase?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>I am pleased the hon. Senator has substantiated my argument. What he is really saying now is precisely what I said in my speech during the Second Reading debate, viz. that an increase in the cost of living results in an increase in wages and salaries, and the bigger salaries and wages become, the more people have to spend on these more expensive commodities and the larger is the revenue from sales tax. This proves my point precisely&#x2014;that it is not a one-time increase.</p>
<p>In conclusion I want to say something about the point mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister, viz. the question of the rich/ poor set-up in South Africa. The hon. the Minister said we should not exploit this question or raise it in speeches too often because we are touching on sensitive matters when we do so, that is, if I understood him aright. I am pleased that he is aware of the sensitivity of this situation. The hon. the Deputy Minister said, <i>inter alia</i>, that we should pay the workers a living wage but now I want to suggest to him that we should not by means of measures taken in this House emphasize that rich/poor situation in South Africa, for instance, by levying sales tax which the rich man can afford but the poor man cannot, because we are then bringing this matter to the attention of those very people we do not want to give attention to it.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#oelrich">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:</from>
<p>And they are sensitive about it.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, they know it. The hon. the Deputy Minister suggests that we should rather pay the workers a living wage. Mr. President, that is another thing which to my mind shows that my NP friends are open to influence because not so long ago when we mentioned this matter of a living wage here it was actually regarded as an obscene expression by the other side.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#senators">
<from>* <person refersTo="hansard">HON. SENATORS</person>:</from>
<p>No!</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, that was so. We were also told: &#x201C;You capitalists pay living wages to your workers; make a start on that.&#x201D; Mr. President, I want to draw the following point expressly to the attention of the hon. Deputy Minister because it is very important. It will not help paying the workers in South Africa a living wage, at whatever level we might choose to do it, if their productivity does not justify that wage. It will be of no avail; we can forget it. By doing that we will merely be pushing up the cost of living further and we will solve no problems. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Groenewald seems to be very irritated, but I do like irritating people like him in this sort of debate. It is proof that what we have to say on this side of the House does in fact cause a little irritation. Before he becomes even more upset, Sir, I shall resume my seat and tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that we shall support the Third Reading.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#toit">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I shall not speak for long, but I do think the hon. the Deputy Minister and I are talking at cross-purposes. I fully agree with him that we should not stress this matter of the rich and the poor too much. We now have a definition of essential food and in cases where food is subsidized the rich and the poor enjoy the same benefit. When the hon. the Minister of Finance introduced the original Bill he assured me that he would use some of the additional revue for that very purpose. Perhaps all the other suggestions I have made have helped to reduce the production costs of items on which, for instance, we cannot have exemption from sales tax or have a subsidy. How is the hon. the Deputy Minister going to subsidize meat? That is impossible; we all know that He is a cattle farmer and he should know it as well. But if he were to help reduce the production costs of those items everybody would benefit. I do hope therefore that we have not been talking at cross-purposes.</p>
<p>As far as combating tuberculosis is concerned, I want to say clearly to the hon. the Deputy Minister that I did not have that in mind and I did not say it either. I just said that our people should eat more of those foodstuffs which prevent tuberculosis. In Britain doctors have suggested that milk from a cow suffering from tuberculosis should be given to a young child rather than no milk at all because by drinking that milk the child will build up a resistance to tuberculosis. That is all I said. If at this stage we could make that food available to everybody as quickly as possible, the account for combating tuberculosis would be much lower in future.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister-of-finance">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I shall only be three minutes. The argument that we should exempt certain so-called basic foodstuffs from sales tax is really aimed at helping the under-privileged. But I showed expressly this evening in the example I quoted of the person who earned R1 272 that such an exemption would mean a rebate of only 42 cents a month for him. In the meantime we have also raised the tax threshhold for Black people from R360 to R1 201 a year. In addition, Sir, we have also abolished the capitation tax for Black people.</p>

<p>What about the Whites?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#deputy-minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>I shall come to the Whites now. The income tax and capitation tax concessions amount to more&#x2014;I want to stress this&#x2014;than that 42 cents which the exemption of sales tax on those so-called basic foodstuffs would entail. [Interjections.] Yes, that was the crux of the hon. Senator&#x2019;s argument. We introduced a sales tax but at the same time we made concessions in respect of tax liability. That is the crux of the matter, Sir. As I have already said, the starting level of tax liability has also been raised in the case of Whites&#x2014;I have already given the percentage&#x2014;and those tax concessions are in fact more than sufficient compensation for the sales tax paid on basic foods. So there is no substance in the argument that basic foods should be exempt from sales tax.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I should also like to stress another point. If a valid argument can be advanced that sales tax on investments in the production process results in the end consumer having to pay a considerably higher tax, such arguments can be submitted to my department and we will consider each one on its merits in order to prevent sales tax contributing to a significant escalation of the tax on the end price of a product.</p>

<heading>UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA (PRIVATE) AMENDMENT BILL</heading>
<p>(Second Reading)</p>
<speech by="#berg">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>The University of Pretoria has deemed it desirable that its principal Act be amended (a) to provide for university activities outside the seat of the university; (b) to provide for a change in the composition of the senate of the university; (c) to provide for the affiliation of or co-operation with any institution or part thereof which has as its object the carrying on of any branch of higher education; (d) to provide for the organization of any portion of the university into schools, colleges or institutions of the university and for the setting up of governing bodies therefor; and (e) to effect certain consequential amendments.</p>
<p>Section 2 of the principal Act is being amended to provide for university activities outside the seat of the university. In the faculties of Medicine and Dentistry, training functions are performed at hospitals situated beyond the boundaries of the seat of the university. This affects medical students at undergraduate and post-graduate level and dental students at the undergraduate level. Provision is also being made in this connection for nursing students. Hence the reference to the S.A. Medical and Dental Council as well as to the Nursing Council. It is also being made possible for university activities to be carried on at a college or institution which is situated outside Pretoria and which is affiliated to the university.</p>
<p>Section 8 of the principal Act is being amended to provide for a change in the composition of the senate of the university.</p>
<p>Mr. President, allow me to motivate this. Firstly, in terms of section 1(a)(iii) of the National Education Policy Act, Act No. 39 of 1967, the training of teachers for primary and pre-primary schools at a college and at a university will be closely co-ordinated as from a date to be determined by the Minister of National Education.</p>
<p>The University of Pretoria and the Transvaal Provincial Administration have already agreed on the means, methods and terms according to which this co-operation will take place. In view of this co-operation between the university on the one hand and the Pretoria College of Education and the Transvaal Education Department on the other hand, the parties concerned have deemed it advisable that a member of the Pretoria College of Education&#x2014;and if there are more colleges of education in Pretoria at a later stage, a member of each such college of education&#x2014;should also be a member of the senate of the university. In terms of this agreement between the university and the Transvaal Provincial Administration, the university will be represented on the council and in the senate of the Pretoria College of Education.</p>
<p>Secondly, since section 1(a) of the National Education Policy Act, 1967, also provides for the training of teachers by the university in co-operation with a technikon, it is deemed advisable, with a view to a possible future agreement about some form of training between the university and such technikon, also to provide for a member of such a college to be a member of the senate of the university.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it is proposed that section 29 of the Universities Act be amended to enable any institution or part thereof which has as its object the carrying on of any branch of higher education to affiliate with a university. If this happens with regard to the training of pharmacists at the Pretoria Technikon, for example, it will also be desirable for a member of the staff of such a technikon to be a member of the senate of the university.</p>
<p>Section 29 is being amended to provide for the affiliation of or co-operation with any institution or part thereof which has as its object the carrying on of any branch of higher education. The primary reason for this is that the possibility of the training of pharmacists by technikons in co-operation with universities, especially universities with medical faculties, was considered by the University Advisory Council and the Committee of University Principals at the request of the Minister of National Education. Such co-operation will involve more intensive academic training and not an expansion of facilities.</p>
<p>The South African Pharmacy Board, too, has already expressed its support for graduate training for pharmacists. Co-operation between the university and the Pretoria Technikon will have to be based on section 29 of the Universities Act. However, this section only provides for the affiliation of the university college to the university. The proposed amendment of section 29 will make it possible for a part of the training given by the technikon, such as the training of pharmacists, to be linked with the university.</p>
<p>Section 4 is being inserted to provide for the organization of any portion of the university into schools, colleges or institutions of the university and for setting up governing bodies therefor. This new section, which already occurs in several other university Acts, is being inserted with a view to future university development.</p>
<p>Clause 5 is necessary for the purpose of making certain consequential amendments. Because reference is made to a &#x201C;college of education&#x201D; in the proposed paragraph (f) of subsection (1) of section 8, it is necessary to define this term in the Act.</p>
<p>Mr. President, these amendments will make the University of Pretoria better able to perform its task of instruction, inquiry and education, and to be true to its motto, <i>ad destination persequor.</i></p>

All those people where there in my time and they were a brilliant lot of students. I must say that they did wrangle among themselves because there was a fight in progress at the time between the people who supported Nusas&#x2014;as it was in those days, not the sort of degenerate Nusas we find today&#x2014;and the new ASB people. And, of course, no need to guess, Mr. President, the ASB people were Dr. Muller, Dr. Rupert and Fritz Steyn while the Nusas people were Frans Cronjé, Freddie van Biljon and myself. But we wrangled in love and peace and the university progressed and prospered over the years.

</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-transport-affairs">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AFFAIRS (for the Minister of Environmental Planning and Energy)</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, allow me to make a few personal remarks before I begin to deal with the Bill. Firstly, I should like to congratulate you, as an old bench companion of mine in the Other Place, on your promotion to this eminent position in our country. It is a privilege to appear before you in another capacity.</p>
<p>As this is the last legislation which I shall deal with on behalf of the Department of Planning, I should like to take this opportunity of conveying my sincere thanks to my colleague, the Deputy Minister, for his support during the months we ran the department and for which we were jointly responsible. I should also like to address a word of thanks to the officials of the department for the dedication with which they perform their duties. Because this department is not often in the limelight, I think it does not always occupy our minds to the extent it should do. The department has an enormous task. The people in the department are inspired and properly qualified and I should like to thank them very much for the opportunity of working with them, even though it was only for a short time.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>By the insertion in 1977 of section 49A into the Group Areas Act, No. 36 of 1966, the restrictive provisions of this Act with regard to the acquisition, possession and alienation of immovable property and occupation or utilization of land, buildings or premises were repealed in areas situated outside group areas and that have been zoned for industrial purposes in terms of any town planning scheme which is in operation or binding under any law. The object of this amendment was to make zoned industrial premises available freely and without authorization by permit to the other national groups as well for utilization for industrial purposes. In this regard I want to mention that it has been the policy in recent years not to include industrial areas in group areas, and where it did happen in the past, steps are being taken, where possible, to deproclaim industrial areas that are not an integral part of a group area and to leave them controlled so that the various population groups may practise industrial activities there.</p>
<p>Since section 49A was included in the Act, it has come to light that there are certain areas, in Johannesburg for example, that were zoned in terms of the town planning scheme as &#x201C;general&#x201D;, which zoning includes different uses, <i>inter alia</i>, industrial. The general zoning is a comprehensive one.</p>
<p>As a result of a civil action, a verdict was returned in the Witwatersrand Division of the Supreme Court in terms of which it was held that the exemption contained in section 49A of the Act, to which I have referred, also applies in respect of any land outside group areas where the zoning, <i>inter alia</i>, allows industrial uses. General zoning also allows industrial use. This verdict implies that a member of any national group may acquire a property zoned as &#x201C;general&#x201D; without authorization by permit and may use&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;and occupy it for purposes permissible in terms of this zoning, <i>inter alia</i>, for residential purposes. Of course, a similar situation could arise in other towns and cities.</p>
<p>Mr. President, this state of affairs is contrary to Government policy, and in all fairness it was never the intention when section 49A was inserted to make provision for these situations in the Group Areas Act. To eliminate this anomaly or contradiction and to achieve the initially intended objectives or scope we wanted to achieve in 1977 through section 49A, and to nullify the interpretation placed on it by the judge, in other words, to close the gap, the legislation we are now considering has become necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I want to thank the hon. the Minister for the explanation he has given us in regard to what I would call this one-clause Bill. We on this side of the House were naturally pleased when that amendment was effected in 1977 because we regarded it as a forward step. I think this is a step which will be approved of by everyone. There was a need for those privileges and naturally they were utilized. I am informed that unfor tunately many of those industrial sites were of such a nature that the buildings did not accommodate commercial undertakings only but that people lived there as well. Apparently that is the aspect that is causing concern. I do not want to say much about this, Sir, but once again I want to express my disappointment that it has become necessary to move an amendment. During the Committee Stage I shall move an amendment in terms of which the right to live on such premises will specifically be excluded. In the meantime I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister could give us an idea of the number of people involved, i.e. whether many people or only a few are involved because that may influence one&#x2019;s attitude.</p>
<p>Am I correct in thinking that the 1977 amendment provided that those sites were not intended for industrial purposes only but for trading purposes as well?</p>

<p>Mr. President, I thank the hon. Senator for supporting the legislation in principle. I just want to explain briefly that the 1977 amendment referred to open industrial areas only. The objective was to give the various population groups the opportunity of sharing in the industrial activities of the country in industrial areas situated outside proclaimed group areas. That is one of the important elements that we want to bring into play to create more equal opportunities for the various population groups so that they too can share in the industrial activities of the country.</p>

<p>I shall deal with that. The hon.

Senator, therefore, whether he would not be prepared to accept my <i>bona fides</i> in this connection. Do not let us use this Bill as a means of legalizing practices other than those we intended to legalize in 1977. Legislation will be introduced that will cover the other circumstances to which the hon. Senator has referred but that legislation will be more comprehensive. It will not include trading rights only but will also cover professional people who will require office accommodation in centrally situated trading districts. But a specific procedure is laid down as to when that can happen. I ask therefore that we do not anticipate it because legislation will be introduced in that regard and when that happens we shall be able to have a more meaningful debate on the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry if I perhaps created the wrong impression during the Second Reading debate. In his reply to the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister convinced me, however, that we should not insist on an amendment at this stage because of the promise he had made. For that reason I asked specifically for this matter to be discussed in Committee. In spite of the fact that those areas were set aside for industrial purposes only, it has been customary for small commercial undertakings to be established there. I am not saying that that was legal but we wanted provision to be made for this. In view of the fact that the hon. the Minister has now given the assurance that legislation in that connection will be introduced&#x2014;I hope it will be soon&#x2014;as a result of the recommendations contained in the Riekert report, we shall not move an amendment.</p>

The recommendation contained in the Riekert report which the Government has accepted contains the principle that there can also be centrally situated business areas which the various population groups will have the right to use and to occupy. But the commission also recommended that a specific procedure should be followed. This will not come about summarily and without any further ado. When legislation is introduced to give effect to the decision of the Government we shall have an opportunity of discussing the matter to which the hon. Senator has referred.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>In this wonderful spirit of co-operation which is prevailing in the House I shall try to be as brief as possible in my motivation of the legislation. According to a legal opinion obtained, with which the State law advisers agree, section 1(3) of the Protection of Businesses Act, 1978, only grants protection to businesses&#x2014;and this is the important word&#x2014;which are the producers of matter or material, or businesses acting on behalf of producers. Certain South African businesses have, in absentia, been accused in the United States of America of having been parties to an agreement which sought to increase the price of certain commodities of a strategic nature by collusion with regard to price determination, allocation, division, limitation of supply and the elimination of competition in regard to commodities and boycotts against certain purchasers of specific goods. Some of the businesses found guilty in absentia in the United States of America are not the producers of the commodities at issue in the court case, nor did they act on behalf of producers. Consequently it would have been possible to apply for a court order in South Africa to impose the American sentence on the businesses concerned in South Africa. The imposition of the American sentences in the cases in question is not considered to be in the interests of South Africa. For this reason it became necessary to amend section 1(3) of the Act to afford the necessary protection to the businesses in question.</p>
<p>Here we are once again dealing with a measure aimed at protecting South Africa and its interests against the onslaught being made on us from so many quarters. I therefore trust that as in previous cases, when I came to Parliament during the session with other measures of this nature, I will get the support of both sides of this hon. House for the measure.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>I know hon. Senators will co-operate with me in piloting this legislation through the House.</p>
<p>The Bill contains three amendments. In the first place it inserts four new sections in the Act with a view to establishing the status of companies operating in states that formed part of the Republic prior to their independence.</p>
<p>†The first of the proposed new sections will empower the responsible Minister to designate for purposes of the proposed legislation any neighbouring country with the Government of which the Government of the Republic has an agreement relating to the registration in that neighbouring country of certain South African companies. It follows that the designation of any particular country as a neighbouring country for purposes of the proposed legislation will necessarily have to coincide with the commencement of legislation of that country relating to the registration of South African companies.</p>
<p>The second of the proposed new sections provides that the provisions of the further two new sections shall, in accordance with the provisions of any agreement between the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the government of a designated neighbouring country pertaining to South African companies deemed to be incorporated or registered in the neighbouring country, apply to such companies. The provisions of the section will recognize the significance of an agreement between the Government of the Republic and the government of any country designated for purposes of the proposed legislation and, at the same time, limit the application of the proposed legislation to the companies in respect of which it should apply.</p>
<p>The proposed third new section makes provision for the procedures which have to be followed when any particular South African company is registered in a neighbouring country designated for purposes of the proposed legislation.</p>
<p>The proposed fourth new section contains certain provisos in respect of the application of the provisions of the first three of those sections.</p>
<p>In the second place an amendment is suggested to the chapter of the Act which makes provision for inquiry into the membership, ownership and control of a company. Under the existing provisions of the Act, any company is obliged to keep a register of its members. Such provisions have been in operation for more than a century. Among others, it has been suggested that the purpose of the register of members of a company is to enable the public to find out who controls the business in which they contemplate investing or to which they may be granting credit. However, the Companies Act, 1973, specifically provides that no company shall be bound to see to the execution of any trust relating to a share, whether express, implied or constructive. It is claimed that this provision is an indication that the legislature is aware of the fact that a registered shareholder might not be the person beneficially interested in the shares registered in his name.</p>
<p>Whatever the purpose of the provision may be it would seem that it has given impetus to the practice whereby persons who acquire shares of a particular company and who do not wish to have their names entered in the register of members of that particular company make use of nominees. The question arises whether beneficial ownership of shares should be disclosed. The principal grounds upon which it is claimed that beneficial ownership of shares should be disclosed are, firstly, that the public should be aware of the identity of those persons who are in control of important industries in the country. In the absence of such knowledge important industries might come into the hands of persons who could use their power to the detriment of the country. Secondly, it is contended that any unscrupulous person may find it easier to make illegitimate use of inside information if he can conceal his dealings under the cloak of a nominee. Such dealings do take place despite the fact that they are presently prohibited by the Act Finally, it is said that information as to the beneficial ownership of shares would be useful to a shareholder who wishes to consult his fellow shareholders as to the affairs of the company.</p>
<p>Whereas it can thus be argued that the shareholders of a company and the public should know in whom the control of the company is vested, it may not be practicable to require all companies to disclose who the beneficial owners of their shares are. Firstly, such a requirement could create a significant volume of administrative work for the company if its shares should often change hands and the company would be required to keep record of declarations made by beneficial owners of shares held by nominees. Secondly, such a requirement will not ensure that the prescribed information will be available at all times. Thirdly, foreigners who wish to invest in the Republic are often desirous to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals against them in their countries and it is therefore possible that the requirement in question may discourage investment in the Republic or that existing investment by foreigners in the Republic may be withdrawn. Finally, it should also be borne in mind that control over a company may be exercised in many of several subtle ways.</p>
<p>*It is proposed, therefore, that section 255 of the Companies Act, 1973, which empowers the responsible Minister to require information concerning persons who have an interest in shares or debentures, be amended. The existing provisions of the section concerned are deficient in some respects and the proposed amendments to the section will remedy these deficiencies.</p>
<p>Finally, the Bill contains a proposed amendment to section 285(2) of the Act. This relates to the power of a company to change the date of the end of its financial year. It is proposed in the Bill that the section be amended in such a way that a company may only change the date of the end of its financial year during the course of such year, in which event the date of any future financial year will be that date. The company may, however, change that date again.</p>

<p>Mr. President, hon. Senators on this side of the House support this legislation. As the hon. the Minister has said, it deals with a few fairly important matters, <i>inter alia</i>, the status of companies in those independent states which previously formed part of the Republic of South Africa. It is as well that we amend our Companies Act timeously to make provision for this. Earlier this year the Association of Accountants had legislation passed which set out clearly the status of those of its members practising in foreign countries. Part of the legislation before us, therefore, is simply consequential legislation in order to effect the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of disclosing the identity of the shareholders. I am pleased that the Government and the hon. the Minister have realized the disadvantages of such disclosure and that this Bill contains an amending clause to rectify the position. With these few words, Sir, we support this legislation.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AFFAIRS (for the Minister of Industries)</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>It is standing Government policy that Government departments should continually give attention to the renewal and improvement of obsolete legislation. This served as the point of departure for the Bill which is now before this House, which has been drafted with a view to&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(1) The consolidation of the principal Act, 1928, and the 15 amending Acts hitherto passed by Parliament; and</li>
<li>(2) the improvement and rewording of this legislation to bring it into line with&#x2014;</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>(a) the Government&#x2019;s standpoints as laid down in recent legislation of this nature, i.e. the measures regulating the Fisheries Development Corporation, the Indian Industrial Development Corporation, and others; and</li>
<li>(b) certain principles contained in the Companies Act.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mr. President, because the legislation under discussion consists mostly of old material which has simply been consolidated in an improved form, I shall not try to discuss every clause in full, as is customary, and I hope hon. Senators will accept that the details of the legislation can more fruitfully be discussed, if they call for discussion, in the course of the debate and in the Committee Stage, although I do not think it is necessary.</p>
<p>However, there are two new aspects contained in the Bill to which I should like to draw your attention. The definition of &#x201C;iron and steel&#x201D; in clause 1 now provides that this means iron and steel in bulk form, e.g. ingots, and that the permission of the Minister of Economic Affairs has to be obtained for the recasting or conversion of these products into other articles. It relates to the Government&#x2019;s basic philosophy of an economic system of free enterprise as also the curtailment of activities of state corporations where this can be done equally efficiently by the private sector. I believe hon. Senators will appreciate the implications of this provision.</p>
<p>In the second place, Sir, you will notice that the powers of Iscor as set out in clause 4 are more clearly outlined than is stipulated in the existing Act where the aims and powers of the corporation are summarized in one section and where the two aspects are somewhat entangled and confusing. I also wish to draw attention to clause 4(5) in terms of which the power of the corporation to obtain loans on its own initiative is raised from an amount equal to three-quarters of its issued share capital to an amount equal to its issued share capital.</p>
<p>†While, as I have stated, I do not propose to dwell at any length on the contents of the Bill as such, I do think this is an appropriate occasion to refer briefly to Iscor&#x2019;s present financial position. As hon. Senators will know, Iscor&#x2019;s financial difficulties arose mainly from factors beyond the control of its management, such as the 1973 energy crisis which caused recessionary conditions throughout the world economies and consequently a severe fall-off in the local and overseas demand for steel.</p>
<p>Therefore at the end of last year I appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. P. F. Theron, Secretary for Industries, with Dr. J. de Loor, Secretary for Finance, Prof. C. W. I. Pistorius, Mr. Kurt Rümelin, General Manager of Iscor, and three other senior members of the Iscor management team as members. This committee has the task of formulating a financial recovery plan for Iscor and I am sure that it will also lay the foundation for an even better future working relationship and co-ordination between Iscor and the Departments of Industries and Finance. The committee has already held two formal meetings and its report with full recommendations has been submitted to me which report I tabled on 20 June 1979.</p>
<p>Various external parameters which influence Iscor&#x2019;s profitability have already been analysed by the committee, for example, Iscor&#x2019;s financial structure and the required future steel pricing policy, taking into account adjustments necessary to improve operational earnings in the short term. Agreement has been reached on vital determinants such as the projected local steel demand over the next five years, growth rate, cost escalation rates and Iscor&#x2019;s minimum capital expenditure and requirements. The main aim is to place the corporation once again on the road to profitability within a couple of years without, however, unduly disrupting other sectors of the economy, including the primary and secondary steel industry itself.</p>
<p>From the information at my disposal, it would appear that Iscor is already on the road to financial recovery. The corporation probably experienced its worst year in 1977-&#x2019;78. Indications are that the loss for 1978-&#x2019;79 could be substantially less than last year&#x2019;s, and for the following year a further improvement is projected, provided the assumed parameters, which are considered to be conservative, materialize.</p>
<p>From the aforegoing it would appear, therefore, that although serious problems are still being experienced, the Corporation has succeeded in reversing the trend of escalating losses. The recovery to full profitability and the time taken to reach this long desired goal will naturally depend on many factors, such as the sustained efforts by management to maintain internal costs and increase productivity generally whilst minimizing capital expenditure, as well as on the vital external elements linked with a positive recovery and healthy growth in the national economy at a reasonable rate of inflation.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#swanepoel">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister has rightly said that this legislation does not really contain any new ideas or new provisions. In many instances the position has just been stated more clearly so as to bring it into line with the modern requirements of a corporation. Consequently we shall not accept the offer of the hon. the Minister to discuss the matter in Committee. I trust that he will accept our suggestion that the Bill be not committed.</p>
<p>I just want to say a few words in connection with the final remark made by the hon. the Minister regarding the activities of Iscor which, over the past few years, have caused Iscor to suffer losses with a resultant increase in the price of steel in an attempt to recoup at least part of those losses. I am pleased that the matter has been thoroughly investigated because the hon. the Minister will know that in our economic life the price of steel can have a very great influence on either lowering or raising the inflation spiral. To check and to control this tendency, Sir, is certainly one of the most important factors affecting the interests of the entire economy of South Africa. I was somewhat disappointed to learn that although the position has more or less been rectified and that the losses have been somewhat less, according to the hon. the Minister, losses will nevertheless still be suffered this year and next year. I trust that the Government and the corporation itself will be patient and wait for an upsurge in the economy and not increase the price of steel again in the near future. This is something which affects the economy of the whole country.</p>
<p>While we wish the corporation everything of the best I nevertheless want to make a final request to the hon. the Minister and that is that before the corporation increases its price it should rather try to raise further loans. I notice that provision is made here for the corporation to negotiate bigger loans in future. It used to be three-quarters of its issued share capital but in future it will be 100% of such share capital. Naturally at the time when there was an upsurge in the economy the corporation itself tried to make provision for unforeseen happenings in the future. Of course, the recession which has hit not only South Africa but the entire world has been partly responsible for the decline in that industry and the increase in the losses. I trust that that stage has now been passed and that the price of the products manufactured by the corporation will be stabilized.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister-of-transport-affairs">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I rise once again simply to thank the hon. Senator Swanepoel for supporting this legislation. The very first thing I did when I became Minister of Economic Affairs was to have discussions with the Board of Iscor because there were very clear indications at the time that, as a result of the recession that had just started, drastic attention would have to be given to the financing and price policy of Iscor. It is very easy to be wise after the event, Sir. We have reaped the fruits during the recession of what I consider to have been a too conservative financing and price policy for Iscor. Had the price of steel products risen gradually and had we thus been able to lessen the debt ratio of Iscor it would probably not have been necessary to effect those drastic adjustments later during the recession. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to foresee exactly what will happen and to act accordingly as one would do if one knew those things were going to happen.</p>
<p>I want to make two statements in this connection, Sir. I think it is absolutely essential that Iscor&#x2019;s debt ratio be placed on a more favourable level. Iscor&#x2019;s aim should be to be profitable and I think this will demand price adjustments in future. It appears that such adjustments will be more reasonable than those we have had in the past because we are on the road towards financial revery. Just to illustrate this: Sir, you will recall that last year this hon. House had to vote R70 million as a subsidy to Iscor. If certain things happen this year, we expect the losses to be less without a subsidy than they were then with a subsidy. That is a good sign. I do not want to be over-optimistic, Sir, but I do think the foundations have been laid for a successful future for Iscor.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mr. President, we are exporting steel, for example, at R80 per ton cheaper than the price on the local market. If hon. Senators consider the amount of steel that is exported they will understand how the profitability or otherwise of Iscor is affected in this specific connection. Unfortunately there is still a surplus of steel on the world market. Personally I think that had it not been for the new energy crisis which the industry is facing, the steel industry would have been on the road to recovery. As a result of this factor there will definitely be a slow-down. I trust, however, that we are at one that this wonderful corporation which has meant so much to the industrial development in South Africa over many years, should be placed on the road to prosperity and success. I thank hon. Senators as far as this is concerned.</p>
<p>I would have liked to avail myself of the friendly offer of the hon. Senator Swanepoel not to have this Bill committed but I gave an undertaking in the Other Place to effect a small amendment. I shall explain it in a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>In accordance with the stated policy of the hon. the Prime Minister, of rationalization of the State and Government service, recent investigations have brought to light that the existing functions with which the Fuel Research Institute has been charged in terms of the Fuel Research Institute and Coal Act, 1963 (Act No. 35 of 1963), can be subdivided and managed as efficiently by a number of other existing institutions that are well equipped to perform similar functions and are already engaged in or participating in these functions to a certain extent. These functions are the following&#x2014;</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) To study and investigate the fuel resources of the Republic (section 2(2)(a) of Act 35 of 1963).
<p>This task could be undertaken as well by the Geological Survey Division of the Department of Mining&#x2014;</p></li>
<li>(b) To undertake scientific and technical research on all matters relating to fuel in general or fuel by-products (section 2(2)(b) of Act 35 of 1963).
<p>The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is already undertaking certain fuel studies and can take over the Institute&#x2019;s functions in this regard, while the office of the State Mining Engineer can take over the Institute&#x2019;s research with regard to better methods of mining coal&#x2014;</p></li>
<li>(c) To undertake the grading of coal&#x2014; principally for export (section 2(2)(c) of Act 35 of 1963).</li>
</ol>
<p>The SABS could possibly integrate this function with its existing functions with regard to standardization.</p>
<p>†After discussion of the matter on 4 May 1979 by the relevant instances, it was decided that a recommendation be submitted to Government that the Institute be dissolved in its present form and that further negotiations be conducted to reallocate the functions of the Institute on the basis I have just enunciated.</p>
<p>As it will only be possible to finalize the necessary negotiations and arrangements in this regard during the Parliamentary recess the purpose of this Bill is merely to enable the Minister of Economic Affairs in the meantime to proceed with the allocation of the functions, duties and funds of the Institute and to arrange for the secondment to the instances concerned of the Institute&#x2019;s personnel for the performance of the relevant functions and duties.</p>
<p>As soon as these arrangements have been concluded and finalized a final Bill will be drafted for consideration by Parliament early in 1980.</p>
<p>In conclusion I wish to say that I fully realize that the private sector&#x2014;the coal industry in particular&#x2014;has a vested interest in the services rendered by the Institute as well as in the facilities available to the Institute in order to enable it to render these services. I therefore wish to put on record that the ultimate dissolution of the Institute will not amount to the termination of these services but that the steps that I have outlined are a serious attempt to establish a more efficient service for all concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House support this brief Bill. Although this legislation is very short and concise it is extremely important legislation to us in South Africa. The high price we have to pay for oil at the moment may perhaps in future, when one thinks back to this period, prove to have been a blessing and not as much a curse as one thinks at the moment. Circumstances are forcing us to devote our energies and abilities to finding alternatives materials that can be converted into fuel and to seeking alternative sources of fuel and energy. It is improbable that the present world supply of oil will be available in the same quantity for very many years to come. Some of the Arabian oil-producing countries have already indicated that if they want to prolong the life of their oilfields they will have to sell less oil on the world markets so that future generations can share in the riches which flow from that oil.</p>
<p>We in South Africa are fortunate, of course, in that we have large coal deposits but although we would like to, we will not be able to use coal for all the different forms of fuel we require. The result is that the fuel we can produce from coal will only meet some of our requirements, not all of them. Nevertheless we are very satisfied to see that the Government is giving its serious attention to this kind of research. One never knows what may in the years ahead or perhaps even during this year, one hopes, still be achieved with this kind of research. Even if in the end nothing much is achieved, I still believe it is worth our while to do this kind of research. When one comes to the end of the road one can at least say one has tried although one&#x2019;s efforts have not been successful.</p>
<p>In conclusion I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I have just looked at the legislation before me, at all the pieces of legislation concerned. Because the name of this department has been changed we shall in future have to effect a number of amendments to these laws. The designation &#x201C;Economic Affairs&#x201D; now falls away. The designation &#x201C;Commerce and Consumer Affairs&#x201D; replaces it. I wonder whether it is worth the trouble effecting the change. I think the designation &#x201C;Economic Affairs&#x201D; encompassed the whole idea, including commerce and industry. &#x201C;Commerce and Consumer Affairs&#x201D; sometimes encompasses economic affairs which fall outside its scope. I mention that in conclusion, Sir, merely as something to think about in future.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I rise merely to ask the hon. the Minister to explain something to me. This Fuel Research Institute has done very good work in the past. I should like the hon. the</p>
<p>Minister to tell us briefly what the Government&#x2019;s attitude is in respect of the manufacture of fuel from products produced by the agricultural sector.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I shall be very brief. I thank the hon. Senator for his co-operation.</p>
<p>I want to underline very clearly one remark made by the hon. Senator Swanepoel, and that is that although the world oil crisis has created many problems for the industrial countries and will cause the economic cards of the world to be reshuffled completely; and, secondly, will also affect us indirectly because we are an important industrial country in the world, this crisis has greatly encouraged us to become more and more independent as far as liquid fuel is concerned than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
<p>We in South Africa can be proud of the fact that we are world leaders in the production of liquid fuel from coal. I read an article in an American journal recently in which the writer said that the answer to America&#x2019;s liquid fuel problems was an answer that South Africa had already found. In this particular respect the people of Sasol have been pioneers and have done a tremendous job of work for South Africa. From the nature of things we have throughout the years been conducting research into the various sources of energy. That research has now become more urgent because while in the past it may often have been an academic exercise on the part of our institutions and universities, it has now become an applied exercise of necessity.</p>
<p>In reply to the question put by the hon. Senator Du Toit the Government&#x2019;s attitude in regard to the manufacture of liquid fuel from replaceable raw material, which includes agricultural products, is influenced by three specific factors. Firstly, whether it has been proved technologically feasible; secondly, whether the raw material is always available; and, thirdly, whether it is economical. I think that answers the hon. Senator&#x2019;s question. The Government will not prohibit any form of manufacture which complies with these specific requirements.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>As hon. Senators are aware, the Board of Trade and Industries, at my request, completed an investigation into the tariff policy and the tariff structure in respect of the provision of electricity in South Africa. The board&#x2019;s report No. 1889 was tabled by me on 4 April 1979.</p>
<p>The recommendations of the board, together with the comments of various bodies on those recommendations, are at present being studied and it is anticipated that they will be submitted to the Government during the recess for a final decision.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there are certain amendments to the Electricity Act, 1958, which are not contrary to the recommendations of the Board of Trade and Industries, and which are necessary for good administration of the legislation and for which provision is being made in this Bill. These provisions include the following:</p>
<p>Clause 1:</p>
<p>In clause 1 it is proposed that the present requirement of the Act that one member of the Electricity Supply Commission should be in the fulltime employment of the commission, be deleted. This complicates the effective composition of the commission.</p>
<p>Clause 2:</p>
<p>Clause 2 refers to section 4A of the Act. Under this section the commission has the power at present to supply electricity in large quantities to a foreign recipient at any point on the border. This refers to our neighbouring states. The proposed amendment means that any future agreement for the supply of electricity by the commission in this regard, is subject to prior consent by the responsible Minister.</p>
<p>†Clause 3:</p>
<p>One of the basic principles of the Companies Act, 1973, is that of publication of information for the benefit of interested persons, add in this particular case also for the benefit of creditors.</p>
<p>This clause provides that in addition to the balance sheet and income statement to be furnished by the commission it should now also furnish a statement of the source and application of its funds and that all these statements should as far as may be determined by the commission be in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1973.</p>
<p>Clause 4:</p>
<p>In clause 4 it is proposed that the present membership of the Electricity Control Board be increased from five to seven persons. In this regard I can only say that in the Government&#x2019;s opinion the board&#x2019;s membership should also include persons with the qualifications referred to in clause 4 for the proper performance of its important task.</p>

<p>Mr. President, we support this legislation. One of the best things this hon. Minister did at the time was to have the tariff policy of this specific corporation investigated. I say this because, just as in the case of the products of other corporations, this is also something that can have very far-reaching repercussions on our economy as far as the inflation spiral is concerned. As this legislation is aimed at promoting greater competency and efficiency, we support it.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
<p>I think hon. Senators will quite probably agree with me when I say that the legislation about to be considered by the House is one of the most important pieces of legislation which has ever been considered here. I think we must relate this legislation to an undertaking which was given by the hon. the Prime Minister when he assumed office as Prime Minister last year. In this connection it is important to note that this undertaking was given by the Prime Minister before the full circumstances of what is known today as the Information debacle were disclosed. Hon. Senators will remember that the hon. the Prime Minister pledged himself to a clean administration for South Africa as one of the highest national objectives which he had set for himself and South Africa. Hon. Senators will also remember that the hon. the Prime Minister pledged himself on the same occasion to orderly government in South Africa. I maintain today that there is a specific connection between clean administration of a country and orderly government. I believe that the one cannot exist without the other.</p>
<p>In view of this it was necessary, in addition to the existing mechanisms to ensure clean administration, to go one step further and create a new institution. In this respect I refer hon. Senators to the existing institutions relating in this particular sphere to the subject forming the basis of the Bill. In the first place we find the institution of the office of Auditor-General. As far as his functions are concerned, he is dependent in the first place on the Executive for his appointment. When the Executive has made this appointment, he functions quite independently of the Executive. In fact, after his appointment he is not responsible to the Executive, but in terms of his own legislation only to Parliament itself. So in respect of the duties conferred on him in terms of his own legislation, he is one of the mechanisms which is instituted to ensure that the Executive, as far as the appropriation of funds of the State is concerned, complies with the conditions which Parliament laid down when it approved such expenditure. Over the years this particular office, and the occupiers of that office, have built up a tradition of the highest Parliamentary integrity. I do not want to turn this discussion into a discussion of the Press, and I hope hon. Senators will follow my example in this particular respect, but the fact remains that in spite of all the upheaval &#x2026;</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>I shall have something to say about the Press.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>The hon. Senator may do so with pleasure. I prefer not to do it, but I do want to make a point in this connection. The institution of the Auditor-General was the institution which initially took the first step to disclose the irregularities in regard to the former Department of Information. What happened afterwards is history; I just want to make the point that this Parliament created the mechanisms to help ensure that we would keep the national administration as clean as possible. The Auditor-General could do that because he was specifically not responsible to the Executive, but to Parliament itself.</p>
<p>I now come to the second organization, viz. the Police who were appointed to do investigative work in connection with crime, whether that applies to the private sector or the public sector. In this particular connection the police, like other State departments, are subject to instructions and decisions of the Executive.</p>
<p>A third organization which is involved in the running of the country and its administration is the office of the Attorney-General. Let me say at once in terms of the debates which have taken place in recent months&#x2019; nobody would accept that Attorneys-General did not fall under the Executive.</p>
<p>If my fundamental statement of attitude is followed, then, it appears to me that because of the assurance and maintenance of clean national administration in a broader sense than the purely auditing function of the Auditor-General, another instrument must be called into being to help ensure that this worthy and estimable objective of clean administration can be achieved and maintained. As I see it&#x2014;and hon. Senators may differ with me here&#x2014;there are certain requirements or qualifications which must apply in such an institution.</p>
<p>To sum up I should like to mention the following, not as an exhaustive list of requirements, but as a list of important requirements. In the first place I would say that it must be independent of the executive. This would mean that although it owes its existence to the executive authority of the State President-in-Council, the body to which it must submit reports after its appointment is Parliament itself. This, of course, we can only ensure and maintain if the decision-making, or the institution where decisions are taken pursuant to that report, is Parliament itself. This implies an important thing: it implies that the parliamentary authority and the status of Parliament are elevated, and that is implicit in the legislation before us. But there is a second point which is important, and that is that there must be confidence in the institutions which must co-operate to ensure clean national administration.</p>
<p>I want to ask at once: How do we create general confidence in the general public in such an institution or such a post? I start by saying that the first requirement is the very fact that it must be independent in terms of its inquiry and in terms of the body to which it must report. I think the second important requirement to ensure confidence in this post and its incumbents are the requirements laid down for the incumbent of this post. And if you look at the legislation before you you will find the prescriptive provisions in respect of the qualifications of the person to occupy the post are in certain cases higher than those set for the Bench. A minimum academic qualification is specifically laid down, but secondly a minimum period of experience in the administration of justice is required. In other words, the second element for the creation of confidence is there. There is a third requirement which is important, Sir, and that is that this body must be seen to function.</p>

<p>Justice must be seen to be done.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#minister">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, that is a good remark. I agree with the hon. Senator. The fact that it is an age-old truth does not detract from the truth of the statement. Perhaps we should tell one another these old truths more often.</p>
<p>The third element is that it must be seen to function. If hon. Senators look at the Bill before them, they will see that the requirement of this office and this institution is that it must function in public. The Advocate-General will, like a court, have the right of discretion, in certain circumstances to act <i>in camera</i> and in others it is obliged to act <i>in camera.</i></p>
<p>There is a fourth element which is important and that is that the legislation which creates the institution must itself make provision for the institution to be protected against people that want to destroy it or bring it in contempt. That is why hon. Senators will find in the legislation they are considering that there is provision in respect of the protection of the incumbent of the post, in respect of the administration, the obligations or the functions entrusted to this office. The officials occupying the post will be entitled, as is the case with the supreme court, to summarily sentence any person who contravenes in this respect.</p>
<p>There is a further important element and that is to ensure confidence. And that, Mr. President, I want to say with great respect today, is a matter for the institution and the members who constitute that institution. That is a matter for hon. Senators in this House. We are making history, Mr. President, by creating this post and this Parliament is creating it. It is therefore the responsibility of this Parliament and its members, when discussing legislation which initiates a new convention in the administration of our country, to refrain from casting suspicion on this office before its birth, as it were. Sir, I would be failing in my duty if I did not express my disappointment that certain bodies and members of political parties have cast suspicion on this institution, before its birth, in the minds of the general public. In this particular respect, Sir, you will permit me to remark that the main object of the legislation, even in the initial form in which it was introduced in the Other Place, was to help ensure a clean administration. The provisions which later became the controversial provisions which were deleted from the Bill, tried to do no more than help achieve that main object.</p>
<p>I find it strange that there were hon. members who thought that to lay down a requirement that only the truth should be published was an offence. I find that strange. I hope this hon. House will not lend itself to such a point of view.</p>
<p>But I want to take it further, because I owe it to the hon. Senators in this House. In this connection I must tell you that because the Government was in earnest about creating this instrument, it was prepared to dispense with this provision which was used to cast suspicion on the legislation and the institution. I find it equally strange that in this particular case reasonableness on the part of the Government is being interpreted as weakness. The Government accepts that such a responsibility rests on itself and on any government in the democratic world. In the final instance it is responsible for the efficient and effective management of the country. It is responsible to ensure that the management and the administration are as clean as possible. It also accepts that there is a responsibility on the media of the country to be sensitive to the interests of the country in their reporting of allegations of irregularity or alleged irregularity. I myself have no axe to grind with the media as institutions <i>per se.</i> I think it is wrong to condemn the media and the Press simply because of the task they have to perform. It is also wrong that we should adopt the attitude that all the media are irresponsible, because that is not true. There are responsible media in the country which make just as big a contribution to the maintenance of democracy and its institutions as we do in this Highest House.</p>
<p>We must all take care that we do not achieve what people would like us to achieve, namely that the responsible media find themselves in the line of fire as a result of a common definition and condemnation of that type of media which South Africa cannot afford. We are in the process of applying a principle throughout, and for that I am grateful. If in the final instance we are to make this organization effective, it must be accessible to the man in the street. It must be a place where the man in the street can give information concerning what he knows about irregularities, malpractices, dishonesty or corruption.</p>
<p>If hon. Senators agree with me then in regard to the aims and the main objects of the legislation, then I ask that in our discussions of the Bill before us we should not be guided by the hysterical outbursts which have taken place in regard to this legislation for many weeks. Let us rather, in the calm atmosphere of this hon. House do what we are called upon to do as responsible people who also have a review function, namely to ensure that reason and rational argument shall triumph as opposed to those incidents elsewhere which have not always been very pleasant.</p>
<p>In a spirit of the Government&#x2019;s commitment to restrict malpractices to a minimum, because it can never be completely restricted, I ask hon. Senators to accept this legislation as an instrument for clean administration, because that is what it is intended to be.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the ancient Romans used to say on occasions <i>ave atque vale</i>, which means &#x201C;Hail and farewell&#x201D;. This afternoon we say farewell to the hon. the Minister in his capacity as Minister of Economic Affairs and we hail him in his new capacity as Minister of Transport Affairs. We express the wish that his activities in his new sphere will be in the interests of South Africa and to the greater good of South Africa.</p>
<p>*Mr. President, my approach towards this Bill and, in fact, to the whole matter, is determined by what is good for South Africa. I am not really concerned about what is good for the Government party, nor, in this case, about what is good for my side of the Senate. The question is what is good for South Africa, and this will be my approach in respect of this legislation. I trust that what I have to say will be accepted in that spirit.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, this legislation has had a long and fairly chequered history. We have in fact a Bill numbered 87, 87A, 87B, and 87C, so it has had a long history, and I must say that I am reasonably happy with the end of that history. In fact, Sir, I can say now that we on these benches will support the motion for the Second Reading. I do, however, want to make one or two remarks.</p>
<p>In the course of this long history things have happened that have done South Africa little good, just as the Information scandal which obviously was the basic reason for legislation of this sort, has done South Africa little good. We are all sorry about the Information scandal. I have said before, Mr. President, that I take no joy in it. I never have taken any joy in it. I realize very clearly, however, that this legislation is an almost logical necessity after what has happened.</p>
<p>The legislation contains, as the hon. the Minister in his skilful speech has outlined, two principles. The one is the appointment of an Advocate-General who will report to the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. I have pleasure in stressing that, as the hon. the Minister himself did, because you will know, Sir, that my standpoint in this House has always been that Parliament should be the ultimate controller in respect of the affairs of the Republic, and not the executive. The executive is responsible to Parliament.</p>

<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>I know the hon. the Minister accepts that and I say that very gladly. So here we have the first principle and that is the appointment of an officer who will report to Parliament after investigating any allegations made to him on affidavit in respect of the misapplication or the mismanagement, misappropriation or the dishonest usage of funds.</p>
<p>The second provision is designed to prevent speculative, unfair Press reporting with regard to the above matters&#x2014;that is as the Bill now stands. Unfortunately, that is not how it started.</p>
<p>But let me say that the immediate public reaction to the question of the appointment of an Advocate-General, of an officer of this sort, is a favourable reaction. I have spoken to my friends, and I have a few in many circles, and the general reaction among the people outside in all walks of life is that the appointment of an Advocate-General is to be publicly welcomed. That is the reaction. I am of the same opinion and I support the establishment of this office. I support it moreover in the shape in which it is being established. If one studies the legislation one will see that the conditions of appointment and dismissal of the incumbent of this post are precisely those that apply to the appointment of the Controller and Auditor-General. The establishment of this post and the appointment of an officer to it with the qualifications that are laid down in the Bill, are completely acceptable to me.</p>
<p>The second principle contained in the original Bill was quite truly designed to prevent speculative reporting, inaccurate reporting, but, in preventing that, the provisions of the original Bill would also have prevented responsible investigative reporting.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Senator accept the <i>bona fides</i> that this was consequential and not intentional?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#horak">
<from>Senator <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:</from>
<p>Yes, I accept that. But I must just sketch the history of this Bill. When I say that this Bill has done the image of South Africa little good, I am referring to it in its original form, because both in and outside South Africa the Government was immediately accused, and rightly so in terms of the original Bill, or seeking to muzzle the Press, of seeking to gag the Press. That second principle as embodied in the original Bill was a gagging principle. I accept that this was consequential, as the hon. the Minister has said, but there it was and it did us no good. In this respect I must blame the Government for hastily embodying in a piece of draft legislation provisions that appeared to the public both here and in the world outside as if the intent was to stop proper, responsible investigative reporting. However, Sir, I will not pursue that line much further.</p>
<p>I want to say a word or two about the Press. The hon. the Minister has already said something about the Press, and I want to agree with him that there are responsible journalists and responsible media and that there are irresponsible journalists and irresponsible media. This is so in the nature of things. But there is an incontrovertible fact, whether we like it or not, and that is that a modern democracy cannot function without a free Press, be it responsible or irresponsible. And I will say why, Sir. In the days of the Athenian democracy it was very easy for the leaders of the people to convene all the people, all the citizens by ringing the tocsin bell. The people would then come together in the public forum and the leaders would address them and acquaint them of the situation that had to be faced at the particular time, whatever that situation might have been. It was very simple because there was direct contact and communication between the representatives of the people and the people themselves.</p>
<p>In the early days of South African politics also our leaders would go out into the country and stand upon an ox-wagon and address the people. That, Sir, in the modern situation with the tremendous increase in the population is no longer possible. We here are still in a fairly fortunate position because we have constituencies of 16 000 or 17 000 people&#x2014; and I refer here to our members of the Other Place. But even with 16 000 or 17 000 people, no elected representative of those people in the constituency can maintain contact with them by himself. He needs a medium. And, of course, in countries where there are 100 000 or 500 000 people in a constituency the thing becomes impossible. The working of modern democracy is therefore dependent upon the existence of the media because otherwise there is no way in which the representative of the people can communicate his thoughts and report his actions to the people who elected him. Therefore, whether we like it or not, the media are a necessary evil or a necessary benefit, take it as you like. They are necessary, and that is the point. I must say that there is very often irresponsibility in the functioning of the media in other countries and in this country. To the extent that there is this irresponsibility, democracy itself suffers, because there is a distortion of what is really thought and said by the leaders and what the people are led to believe by the media that the leaders think and say. The more accurate and responsible the Press is, the better democracy functions. But you have to have a freely operating press, otherwise democracy does not work.</p>
<p>I have said that the original Bill did not do South Africa&#x2019;s image much good. I have said that the Press should be responsible. That is the ideal situation. I do not suppose that all of us are responsible all the time. I am not now making references to any of my colleagues!</p>
<p>This Bill went to a Select Committee and it emerged from that Select Committee in what is to me and my colleagues a much more acceptable form because the Bill as it stands leaves only the appointment of an Advocate-General. I believe this is a good thing and I have already said that I believe that the public outside believe it is a good thing.</p>
<p>The Bill has another provision which deals with the status of the Advocate-General in relation to the media and anybody else. This provision is embodied in clause 8. Clause 8 provides first of all that nobody shall insult, disparage or belittle the Advocate-General of an assistant to the Advocate-General. This is right. I do not believe that this official, this highly placed officer, should be placed in a position where he can lightly be insulted, disparaged or belittled.</p>

I think the clause is too wide. The word &#x201C;anticipate&#x201D; in that sense is well understood by us, but it is not well understood by everybody. This clause is the only remaining peg upon which the opposition to this Bill is being hung.

<p>No, Sir. I said my &#x201C;rivals&#x201D;. A rival is never in one&#x2019;s own company. I did not want to say my &#x201C;enemies&#x201D;, because that is a harsh word. This clause is the remaining target in this Bill because some people think, with some justification, that its terms are so wide that an innocent report about a matter which is being inquired into could be construed as an offence. Therefore, I shall move, in the Committee Stage, an amendment which I believe will clarify this matter.</p>

<p>Indeed, you are. I will not read my amendment now but will move it at the Committee Stage. I have given the hon. the Minister notice of what it is. He is being most co-operative and therefore I say, as I said earlier, <i>ave atque vale.</i> I will move the amendment at the Committee Stage, but I wish to say finally that it is a pity that this Bill first appeared in the form that it did, because it really then looked like a Bill which was aimed at muzzling the free Press. I have said that, fortunately or unfortunately, a free Press is essential to the working of a democracy and that the muzzling of a free Press actually strikes at the basis of democracy. I have said why. If you do that, you destroy the communication between the elected representatives of the people and the people themselves. You destroy it or you limit it, or you qualify it or you condition it. The Bill looked like that in its first form. I want to say that I am appreciative of the fact that it has now emerged differently. In fact, it will be even better when the hon. the Minister accepts my amendment. Therefore, and on behalf of my colleagues, I declare my support for the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

<p>I speak only as an ordinary, practical politician with many years service. I am one of the ordinary people to whom the hon. the Minister referred. I do not want to start a quarrel with the Press either, because I have always said there are three people one must not quarrel with in practical politics if one wants to survive. The one is a public servant who can put your file right at the bottom of the pile on his desk. The other is the private secretary to a Minister because they can prevent your representations reaching the Minister. The third person is a journalist because they can give you a very bad name in the newspapers.</p>

<speech by="#minister-of-transport-affairs">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Or say nothing about you. *Senator Dr. J. H. LOOCK: Yes, they ignore you to death or they finish you off with scandal. I was fairly intimately concerned with two newspapers, <i>Die</i> <i>Suiderstem</i> and <i>Die</i> <i>Landstem.</i> Anybody connected with <i>Die Landstem</i> knows a bit more about journalism than a person who has worked on an ordinary newspaper. I have a very high respect for and appreciation of the Press, therefore. I am pleased about the form of this Bill before the House, because I did not care too much for the first Bill either. Before I go any further with my speech, I should like to congratulate our President on the high office he now occupies. I want to do this in a personal capacity because 15 years ago I entered into a gentleman&#x2019;s agreement with the hon. President when I asked him to vote for me as Senator. Little did I dream 15 years ago that he would be my superior at the end of my career in the Upper House of Parliament. I fulfilled my part of the bargain and I take it that he will fulfil his. I told him yesterday that our previous two presidents took a few months before they were comfortable in that Chair, but as far as he is concerned he occupies the Chair as though the Chair was made for him. I hope he will spend a long and happy time here, perhaps longer than we think.</p>
<p>I should also like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his enhanced status as Minister of Transport Affairs. They say that many countries would have had far better governments if their people had not become too tired to govern, and our value in South Africa lies in the fact that our people do not get tired of governing. If there is one thing we can admire about this hon. Minister it is his boundless energy, and as long as we have Ministers like that in the Cabinet we shall not be too tired to govern the country. He likes helping to govern the country.</p>
<p>Now I want to say that this Government is not the only one involved in scandals. There are two ways of bringing out the downfall of a government; either by rejecting its policy or through financial scandals. There has never been a case in this Parliament in all the years I have sat here, and I have been here since 1935, where either a member of Parliament or a Minister or anyone else got away with a financial scandal. That redounds to the credit of the South African Parliament. You can get up to a lot of things in this hon. House in other respects &#x2026;</p>

<p>I just want to say that we are not the only Government which has had to contend with these malpractices. I have a cutting here from <i>The Argus.</i></p>

<p>So, we are a long way behind America as far as scandals are concerned, Watergate included. We have a good record. In the 30 years we have governed here, we have not had ten outstanding financial scandals in the House, that is, three for every ten years. That is a very small percentage. We know of all the cases.

<p>Yes, you know the history and you know about the cases. I happened to be involved in some of those matters, and I was intimately involved in some of them. We know about the days of the Kopersbond. And from 1948 the Opposition has tried continually to bring about our downfall through monetary and financial scandals. Many of these scandals were not uncovered by the Press. Many of these scandals were first brought to light by the NP. As far as the Agliotti scandal was concerned, I was the first man to say at a meeting of the executive committee that the Agliotti transaction was a scandal, because I am in the property business and I knew about it.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. J. H. LOOCK</person>:</from>
<p>The NP Government did not cover up these things. You know how many of the Ministers and Deputy Ministers were involved in this. It is not a case of their having done something wrong or stolen money, to put it that way. They were involved quite incidentally. Take a man like Dirkie Uys; he is out. He had nothing to do with the Agliotti scandal, but he was the Minister concerned. Take the case of Rall; take the case of Mr. Jan Haak who had to leave partly because of that. So this Government has shown over the years that it does not mind disclosing facts. And where people in high places have been involved, they have been dismissed. When this Information scandal became known, the first man who had to go was the Secretary of the Department and after that the Minister went. Recently we had the position, as a result of the Erasmus report, where even the State President resigned.</p>
<p>We do therefore have a record of good administration, but what we want to do through this Bill is to appoint an Advocate-General so that if one hears something, one can go to him. We have no objection to the Press publishing things, but then they must not publish untruths. That the Press was so concerned about the legislation was not entirely true either. I have <i>The Cape Times</i> here and it has a photograph of Mr. Eglin at a lunch time protest meeting in the Cape Town City Hall. It shows six people there waiting their turn to speak, and I can only see five in the audience. Everybody can see this, but it shows the enormous influence of the Press when it wants to distort something. I think there was more agitation against the Press than is symbolized in this photograph, but at the same time it shows how a newspaper can destroy its own people. The Minister himself can see from this that there was not all that much agitation, not even against the first Bill.</p>
<p>The only objection we have to the Press is that if they find out something like this and hang a label round a man&#x2019;s neck, then they hammer away at it, as they did with the Information scandal, until after the Minister has resigned and the Secretary of the department has resigned. They gnaw away at it <i>ad nauseam.</i> And there is something we are not blind to, Mr. President, viz. that these bodies seek out a certain section of the Press and that, of course, we must oppose, and we shall oppose it. A certain section of the Press seeks out destruction; they want to bring about the fall of the Government.</p>
<p>Financial scandals have been used by them since 1938 to try to unseat the Government They started with me. When I came to Parliament in 1949 they sent the brother of a former Cabinet Minister to me with an offer of R500 000 (£250 000), and I was asked to bribe five people in Parliament. I do not want to give the names here, but I could give you the names. At that time we only had a majority of five in Parliament. I had to organize things so that those five would not vote for the Government on some legislation or other, and in that way the Government would be defeated. Each of us would then take £50 000 (R100 000) and get out of politics. Then I said: &#x201C;No, I prefer sitting on the green benches.&#x201D; In those days I was not as keen on money as I am now. But if they were to make me an offer now I might consider it.</p>
<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that we must furnish proof of what had happened in the old governments. This is tangible evidence of what happened to be personally, i.e. that for R250 000 I had to bribe people. That is as much as Kallie Knoetze got for his fight in Mmabatho. Then I had to bring down the whole NP Government! Sir, I do not want to delve deeper into the past; after all, I lived through the war years. I know what happened to the sheep farms they bought up for the returned soldiers. I know who farmed on them and at what price they farmed on them, while the soldiers were still up north. That is why we lost the election at the time.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I do not want to go into these matters any further because just now I will have deviated too far from the clause. I have said I am not a legal man; I just wanted to say a few words to put the practical view of the practical people in politics. I think if the Advocate-General is appointed, and he stays in the Carlton Hotel for a week, he will have work to do.</p>

<p>Yes, my whole party! I do want to say, though, that I think some unfair things have been said about the Press today. I am no personal friend of the Press, or that kind of thing. But let us look back at the history of this matter. How many organizations raised their voices about the original legislation? I am very pleased that the Government saw fit to effect these amendments. I feel quite happy about them. Let us just see which organizations raised their voices about this matter. It was not only the Press, Sir. It was the Dutch Reformed Church, the ASB, the Railway trade unions, the Staff Association of the SABC&#x2014;that organization which is dominated by the Government, His Master&#x2019;s Voice. Even they spoke out against it [Interjections.] If the editor of <i>Die</i> <i>Vaderland</i> was still attached to <i>Die Vaderland</i> that newspaper would not have objected, but even <i>Die</i> <i>Vaderland</i> objected to the original legislation.</p>
<p>Everybody requested that the legislation should please be reconsidered. I want to say again that I am very pleased that the Government did so. What did Prof. Strauss of Unisa say? His words were&#x2014;</p>

<p>Oh, I beg your pardon. I am just thinking of everything that was said about the Press. I just want to stress that it was not only the Press. I think all right-thinking people&#x2014;and of course we had no objections from that side of the House&#x2014;in South Africa thought about it for the reasons which the hon. Senator Horak spelt out very clearly here. It did not do the image of South Africa any good. When we first heard the story of the Information scandal, I said in this House that there were two things that had improved the image of South Africa. In spite of the fact that none of us wanted this sort of thing&#x2014;I certainly find no joy in it&#x2014;the world outside could still say that South Africa still had a free Press, and secondly that the Bench, because of the actions of Mr. Justice Mostert, was still the most just and wonderful Bench in the world. That is why I say that we should not put all the blame on the Press. I know it was said in some sections that the Press and the public had become hysterical. I do not think that is really true. I think all the organizations I have mentioned pleaded for this legislation to be improved. Consequently I think it was very sensible of the Government to effect these amendments. Having received the assurance from the hon. the Minister, I shall most definitely vote for the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said&#x2014;and he could be right&#x2014;that we are making history today by accepting this legislation which establishes the post of Advocate-General. I just hope his appointment is no reflection of what we can expect in the future. I hope there will be no corruption. The other point I want to make very clear is that I hope it will never cast any reflection on our highly respected Public Service, because I think we have officials in this country who are absolutely trustworthy. Every now and then one finds a black sheep, but that was really an error of judgment on the part of the Cabinet of the former Government. They appointed a person over the heads of other people, and he is the major culprit. I think that all right-thinking people have the highest appreciation of the Public Service and I hope that in time the Advocate-General will have so little to do that we can discharge him from his post.</p>
<p>With those few words I should like to support the legislation.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#zijl">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">P. H. S. VAN ZIJL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President in the first place may I, together with the other speakers, congratulate you on the high office you occupy. I have often had the pleasure of seeing you in action in this House. It was a great privilege, and this is the first time you will have to listen to me from the Chair. That is also a privilege. I hope my contribution will meet with your approval.</p>
<p>May I also congratulate the hon. the Minister on the high office he now occupies. I know that his tracks are clearly visible, in the sunlight and the moonlight. We know those are good tracks and he will stay on the right road.</p>
<p>As the hon. the Minister said, the object of this legislation is a clean Government and a clean administration. That was how our hon. Prime Minister put it. Here we have the opportunity of preventing a recurrence of the problems we had in regard to the Information scandal. Had the Advocate-General already been in office, this scandal would never have assumed the proportions it did. This debate has taken place in such a sensible and calm atmosphere that I do not want to say anything to disturb this good spirit. But the fact remains that the slogan of some newspapers was: &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t go away.&#x201D; There was an editorial with that heading: &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t go away.&#x201D; Had there been an Advocate-General that situation of: &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t go away&#x201D; would not have occurred. It would have gone to the Advocate-General and through his investigation it would have been laid before the Speaker or the Leader of the House, as provided in the Act. It would then have gone to a select committee consisting of members of all parties. They would have thrashed out the matter. As the hon. the Minister said, it would then have been in the hands of Parliament, i.e. those who are really responsible for the administration of the country, and not with the executive authority where the hon. Senator Horak wanted it. In this I agree with him one hundred per cent. It belongs in Parliament. It would have ended up there.</p>
<p>The fact that this scandal assumed these enormous proportions and caused such damage, as other hon. Senators have mentioned here, is due to the fact that there was no other way of dealing with it on an objective and non-emotional basis. If it could have been done on that basis, this situation would never have arisen. The situation regarding the Press is a very old one. The conflict between the Press and the authorities has been going on for a long time in the history of South Africa. I happened to read that <i>The South African Commercial Advertiser</i> which was printed by a certain George Greig, the editors of which were Pringle and Fairburn, published 18 editions in 1824. The editions were so anti-administration that they were censored. Their press was closed down. Greig was deported. He went to Parliament in England and asked that his Press should be reinstated. The then Secretary of Colonial Affairs upheld Greig&#x2019;s appeal and he came back to South Africa and opened his press again. He had hardly started printing when he was banned again. The conflict between the Press and the authorities has been going on for a long time. It has happened repeatedly in our history.</p>
<p>How can one prevent such situations arising, as will in fact happen in future, if there is no such institution as the Advocate-General. It will make the relationship between the authorities and the Press much sounder, because it will take place at the level where an authorized body will deal with the allegations laid before it. The truth or otherwise of all the allegations made are then properly tested. It will go to Parliament where it will be tested once again, so that in all respects the public can be one hundred per cent satisfied that the complaint made has been dealt with properly. Then the Press will also be able to feel the responsibility for any publication they make, because their statements will be tested by the Advocate-General. Let us put it this way: Any Tom, Dick or Harry can come forward with a complaint now, but to prevent such wild allegations being made, it must be done by way of affidavits. There is also the protection that when a complaint is made, there must be substance to the complaint, which is also important. When a complaint is made, it must have substance.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister dealt very fully with all the aspects of the Act as such and what the intention of the Act would be. There is only one aim, viz. clean administration. There is not the slightest attempt to curb the Press. Where we had differences of opinion in regard to the original legislation, we have cleared up those differences of opinion. This is a sign of the sound democratic approach of the Government which proves that in the heat of the battle it can listen to what its critics have to say. Its ears were opened wide to listen to the justness of the good arguments which came from all sides. The hon. Senator Du Toit told us here where all the complaints came from. The fact that the Government lent an ear to the opinion of one and all is after all a sign of the sound approach and the <i>bona fide</i> sincere intentions which the Government has in regard to the matter and the object they want to achieve. It is fitting therefore that I should compliment the hon. the Minister on the mature way in which this legislation has been piloted through all its stages. This is once again a sign of how anxious the Government is to obtain the opinion of one and all, so that we can have unanimity here and feel that we are all on the right track. It is a great pleasure for me to support this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. President, in the first place I want to thank the hon. Senator Horak for his friendly farewell and also for his friendly reception. It was pleasant to come to this hon. House with my old responsibilities. In this connection I have only pleasant memories of my association with hon. Senators in this hon. House.</p>
<p>I also want to say thank you for two other things. Firstly, my thanks to hon. Senators for their support for this legislation in principle, and secondly for the pleasant atmosphere in which the debate took place.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Horak was quite right in saying that this legislation has something of a history, and some of the periods in the course of this history were less pleasant. But I want to tell the hon. Senator Du Toit at once that there is no one on this side of the House who does not deeply regret the incidents and the circumstances which led to the irregularities&#x2014;and I am stating it euphemistically&#x2014; connected with the now defunct Department of Information.</p>

<p>Yes, all of us regret them. We must not make the mistake of assuming that it was only the NP and the Government that has been harmed; South Africa has been harmed. Even though we differ as political parties, I have always assumed that all of us, at least as political parties, have the interests of South Africa at heart. I also assumed that although we might differ as to our methods of how we would best serve our country, we do not differ in our object that we want to achieve. This legislation has its origin in the spirit of the fact that what is important is the interests of South Africa.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I do not want to delay the Second Reading debate any further, apart from making a few fundamental remarks on the contributions of all the hon. Senators who have spoken here this afternoon. Firstly, put quite simply, the Bill at its commencement sought to establish an instrument which would effectively help, together with legislation which already exists, to ensure pure, honest and clean administration for our country. At the beginning it was felt necessary to include restrictions in regard to publication in the Bill, not as an object in itself, but in order to ensure that the main object would be achieved in a way which would not prejudice the country&#x2019;s interests, and which would ensure the publication of the full truth concerning alleged irregularities. I want to stress this&#x2014;would ensure the publication of the full truth. The reaction to the specific provisions dealing with publication or non-publication by the media and the Opposition&#x2014;a reaction with which I do not necessarily agree, but which I do not want to debate because it is no longer relevant&#x2014;was such, however, that suspicion was cast on the achievement of the main object of the legislation. And the main object would have miscarried if the Government had decided to go ahead with those provisions.</p>
<p>To sum up, I want to say that that was never the intention, and in order to achieve the main object of the Government it was decided to relinguish the restrictive measures to avoid even the appearance of wrong, as I have already explained to hon. Senators. But I must stress that the Government in this respect still accepts that we shall only be able to have an effective functioning of this instrument if there is general confidence in the office and the incumbent. I really do hope that the omission of these restrictive provisions will contribute to the creation of this confidence and that everyone, hon. Senators opposite and the media as well, will avoid themselves of this opportunity to help create confidence, and that no further suspicion will be cast on this measure, as happened in the Other Place this morning.</p>
<p>Regarding the omission of the provisions and the fact that reason has triumphed in this case, I want to stress that this does not detract from our objects. The Government is not relinquishing its standpoint, namely that all the media which claim to be free and to serve democracy have an obligation, and that is to verify the truthfullness of what they publish. Democracy can only be upheld by a free Press or a free media, with the qualification that freedom is not licence, and that freedom is not licentiousness, but that freedom implies responsibility. This applies to the media as much as it does to us, because restriction of our freedom is the protection of the freedom of others. The restriction on the freedom of the media is the recognition of the freedom of the subject they are writing about. If we agree with one another on this&#x2014;and I do not think we differ&#x2014;we as an institution and the media as an institution, because both have their origin in democracy itself, will co-operate with each other in future instead of opposing each other. Seen in that light, Mr. President, a lot of good has been born from the course of this legislation, and for this I am grateful and I think hon. Senators will share that view with me.</p>
<p>In this connection there is a second important point, viz. that the Government has accepted assurances from the media that they in their turn they will make efforts during the recess to ensure that they will achieve what we regard as a common objective, and that they will achieve it in consultation and discussions with the Government itself. I hope that those of us who put such enormous trust in the media will not be disappointed and will not have to resort to other steps. One of the most important rules in the code of the media is to ensure that the truth is published. Because if one takes liberties with the truth and does not put a high price on it, the function of dissemination of information, which is the responsibility of the media, is not fulfilled. And the function of education, for which the media is also responsible is not fulfilled either, for education has just one basis, Sir, and that is the search for truth. Without the truth there is no education or training. In my view we have come a long way to be able to have this common approach today.</p>
<p>†I accept that for democracy to survive the media have to survive, but for the survival of both the search for the truth is a prerequisite. I would like to stress this point. I do not believe that this Government or any government for that matter, is infallible. I do not even pretend that I am; but the Government and I, like other hon. members of this House, are committed to seek the truth, to seek what is best for this country and to avoid the misappropriation of public funds and corruption. This legislation is not intended as a slur on people in Government whether they be in the executive section of Government or in the administrative section of Government. However, it endorses one basic truth, viz. that people in public life are never lauded and should not expect to be lauded for attaining 99% success, but to be condemned for their 1% failures. This is the hazard of the job which does not make it very pleasant. Let me say as one man to other men, it is not pleasant for one&#x2019;s family either. We have to take care lest good men avoid public life because they are not prepared to accept this risk. There is a saying that when good men do nothing, rogues take over. We have to guard against this, all of us have to guard against this, including the media. I hope that when the test really comes we will all be weighed in the balance and not found to be wanting.</p>
<p>*I have already referred to what was said by the hon. Senator Du Toit and have replied to his inquiries, for he asked who had cast suspicion on the legislation under suspicion. I do not want to identify culprits now, except to say that suspicion was cast on this legislation before it was published. I think that with this I have replied to the question. I also want to thank the hon. Senator Van Zijl for his contribution. I agree with him that it is a natural action of governments and people not to expose their mistakes. However, because that is the duty of the media on the other hand, there will obviously be a conflict Our task is to see whether we can find a method of reconciling these two points of departure. So in this particular aspect this legislation constitutes a reconciliatory element I also want to thank the hon. Senator Dr. Loock for his contribution. One might not believe it, but the hon. Senator and I come from the same part of the world, only I have not made as many detours as he has done to get where we are today.</p>
<p>†When I listened to the hon. Senator this afternoon, I thought that this was a session for confession. I have some legal advice for the hon. Senator for which he need not pay. He indicated that if he were to receive that same offer again of R500 000 he might be tempted to take it. I want to tell him that it is also a crime to incite crime.</p>
<p>*I want to thank hon. Senators for their support for this measure. I have indicated that I shall accept the amendment of the hon. Senator Horak, and in this connection I just want to say that I shall move an amendment to clause 4 during the Committee Stage. At present the clause provides that &#x201C;any person who has reason to suspect&#x201D;, and I want to substitute for these words &#x201C;if any person has reasonable grounds to suspect&#x201D;. I did not accept the amendment in the Other Place, but after the Committee Stage had been taken, I thought about the matter again and decided that I would effect this amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>
<speech by="#minister-of-transport">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AFFAIRS</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">On page 6, in line 27, to omit &#x201C;reason&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;reasonable grounds&#x201D;.</block>
<p>We have tried to ensure that the requirements laid down for anybody who wants to go to the Advocate-General with allegations of irregularity or alleged irregularity, be limited. It has been argued that he should be required to have reasonable grounds for his suspicions. It is a question of terminology and I do not think there will be any objection to the substitution of the words as moved by me.</p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>

<block name="quote">On page 12, in line 15, after &#x201C;Advocate-General&#x201D;, to insert:</block>
<p>in a manner calculated to influence such proceedings or findings</p>
<p>The insertion of these words speaks for itself, but I would like to point out that it removes beyond any shadow of doubt the idea that there is any intention of curbing the Press. It will now only be an offence if the findings or the inquiry of the Advocate-General are anticipated with the intention of influencing them. As the hon. the Minister has indicated that he will accept the amendment, this side of the House will support the Third Reading.</p>

<summary>(Motion)</summary>
<speech by="#leader-of-the-house">
<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard">LEADER OF THE HOUSE</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
<block name="quote">That this House now suspend business until <recordedTime time="1979-06-22T21:00:00"/>21h00, provided that Mr. President may, if he thinks fit, accelerate or postpone the time for the resumption of business.</block>
<p>I should like to take the opportunity, while introducing this motion, of expressing my thanks to certain people. I want to start, Mr. President, and I know I am speaking on behalf of everyone in this House when I do so, by expressing our thanks and appreciation to the former President of the Senate, the hon. Senator Marais Viljoen, who now, of course, occupies the high office of State President. I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate too much on this part of my motion. As I said, I am certain that I am speaking on behalf of all hon. Senators because the hon. Marais Viljoen, ex-senator, is a man who occupied the office of president of this Senate with great distinction. I think we will always remember his friendliness and fairness, and it is a pleasure for me to be able to mention his name in this respect.</p>
<p>Then I want to thank you, Mr. President, even though you have only been with us a few days in this capacity, for having taken over here at short notice as it were. We wish you great joy and success in the year or two or three still remaining; I am not too sure how long this Senate will still continue, but no matter how long it may be, we wish you everything of the best.</p>
<p>Then it is also a great pleasure for me to thank our old friend, the hon. Senator Hardie Muller, Deputy President and Chairman of committees, once again for the distinguished way he has officiated here this session. We trust that things will go well for him and his wife and that they will have a good rest during the recess and return to us once again next January.</p>
<p>I should also like to mention the name of our friend, the hon. Senator Herman Oelrich, Leader of the official Opposition. The hon. Senator Oelrich is so well known in this Senate, and in fact in politics in the Republic, that I most certainly need not go into too much detail in regaid to him. I also want to thank him for the manner in which he has conducted himself and we wish him a very pleasant recess.</p>
<p>I want to thank our temporary chairmen. They are the hon. Senator Van Rensburg; the hon. Senator W. P. Gouws; the hon. Senator G. P. van den Berg; the hon. Senator W. C. Dempsey and the hon. Senator C. C. Henderson&#x2014;all the young Senators who conducted themselves so well here. We wish to thank them very much.</p>
<p>When we speak of the smooth functioning of the business in this Senate we must address a special word of thanks to our Chief Whips, viz. the hon. Senator Gouws behind me, who is well-known to all of you. Just as well known is the hon. Senator Horak sitting opposite me. These are two redoubtable politicians and I hope that they will be with us again next year, refreshed and in good health.</p>
<p>I also say thank you to the other Whips of the other parties who were always in their places to keep things functioning smoothly. We thank them very much as well.</p>
<p>†The hon. Senator Winchester is not here today, but we should like to thank him as well. I hope the hon. Senator Winchester will not mind my calling him a maverick Senator in this House, but he has certainly contributed to making this a somewhat colourful place at times. We thank him for his contribution as we do the hon. Senator Du Toit. The hon. Senator Du Toit is the Leader of the Independent Party in this House. He is on his own as is the hon. Senator Winchester, but be has shown he can hold his own and we are glad to have him here. We hope he too will have a very pleasant respite.</p>
<p>I also want to thank all the other hon. Senators. After all, this House would not be what it is if it were not for the hon. Senators who are members here, and I think I can say that despite all our differences at times among the parties, we are, after all, a club, a rather pleasant club, and I think we are all very honoured to be here and probably would not wish to be anywhere else.</p>
<p>*And then, Mr. President, a special word of thanks to our secretariat, to Mr. Victor, Mr. Venter and the other members of the secretariat who have rendered such dedicated service and who have been of such great assistance to us.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Sir, I really do not know how we would have managed had it not been for Mr. Victor and the friendly members of his secretariat Once again, thank you very much.</p>
<p>†To all the other members of the Parliamentary personnel we extend our warm appreciation, and I hope Mr. Victor will be good enough to convey this to them all. Perhaps I should mention especially the staff of Hansard. I think if there are people who really deserve a hearty vote of thanks it is the staff of Hansard who day after day sit here and record every single word that is spoken in this Place.</p>

<p>I think that must take some doing and with great respect to all the hon. Senators of this House I usually feel quite sorry for Hansard. That includes my own speeches! So we thank them very much indeed, Mr. President.</p>
<p>*Then, Sir, I want to say thank you to all the service officers who have been so helpful. They are an integral part of the organization of this Senate, and we have the highest appreciation for the way they carry out their duties. We also want to include the Police and the Security Services in this motion of thanks, and convey a special word of appreciation to them for the way they maintain law and order here and ensure the security of these Houses of Parliament and everyone connected with them.</p>
<p>*HON. SENATORS: Hear, hear!</p>

<speech by="#leader">
<from>The <person refersTo="hansard">LEADER OF THE HOUSE</person>:</from>
<p>Then, Mr. President, we have the Press, the SABC and the television service of South Africa. I suppose most of us at one time or another during the session become a little impatient with one or other newspaper. We probably feel we have not had the publicity we should have had for our brilliant contributions. But all these things come out in the wash, they balance out in the end and the Press and the broadcasting services and television services are a quite inseparable part of our whole organization and we see them in that light.</p>
<p>In general, Mr. President, I would merely say that it is an honour for me to be able to move this motion as Leader of the House. The session has been an interesting one; it has been a lively one at times. For me it has not been the most pleasant session, if I may be perfectly frank, but, after all, there is such a thing as the rough and tumble of politics and one has to take the rough with the smooth. I think the great merit in our parliamentary tradition is that one does not bear any personal animosity and these things eventually all fall into place, they take their rightful place and are seen in proper perspective.</p>
<p>I hope all hon. Senators will have a particularly happy, restful and healthy recess. I hope all of us will come back next year feeling refreshed, and full of vigour to meet the further duties that will be confronting us.</p>
<p>Precisely how long this distinguished Upper House will continue, I am not sure. I think our present expectation is that we will continue till the end of 1980. That is the plan; whether it will work out precisely on that date, is a matter that the future will have to tell. However that may be, I for one&#x2014;and I think I speak for all my hon. friends in this House&#x2014;feel honoured to be a member of this Upper House of the Parliament of South Africa. As long as we are here and as long as the Senate does exist, I am sure we would all like to continue as one basically happy family, I think. I think we would like to continue to do our very best not only for our respective parties in a democratic system but for our country.</p>
<p>*In that spirit, Mr. President, I say again that it has been my privilege to express these few words of thanks and to move this motion of thanks and appreciation.</p>

<speech by="#oelrich">
<from>*Senator <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I should like to associate myself with the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the House. On behalf of the official Opposition we should like to express our appreciation to all who contributed to the business of this House. This was perhaps one of the most difficult sessions many of us have experienced.</p>
<p>†Perhaps I might just interpose here, Sir, to say that I appreciate very much the spirit in which the Leader of the House has addressed us here when one considers everything that has taken place during this particular session. It is nice to know that he feels as we feel, namely, that whatever one does, whatever speech one may make, whatever attitude one may adopt, when we come to this particular hour of saying cheerio to each other, we do so in a very good spirit.</p>
<p>*As I said, Mr. President, this was probably one of the most difficult sessions I have ever experienced. On occasion harsher words were spoken than we are normally accustomed to in the peaceful atmosphere of this Upper House. But that does not prevent us expressing our recognition of those who deserve recognition. During this session we also had a change of President of the Senate. I think it would be fitting if we thanked our former President <i>in absentia</i> for his exemplary conduct at all times.</p>

<p>To the new President we also want to say thank you for what he has done in the few days he has been with us. We hope he will recover completely from the throat infection he contracted, and that he will have a good rest and will be able to resume his post next year with competence.</p>
<p>To the Leader of the House, who, as he himself admitted underwent a particularly busy and difficult time, we also want to wish a pleasant rest, knowing that although we sometimes differed with him very strongly, we are nevertheless able to part in a good spirit.</p>
<p>I want to repeat what he had to say about the secretariat and all the members of the staff who fall under them. We are all well aware of how much time they have to spend to ensure that everything functions smoothly. If any minor matter goes wrong, it causes a major disruption, and they are at all times aware of their responsibilities.</p>
<p>We wish to convey our sincere thanks to the catering services and the security policy who have protected us here and to everyone we see here every day. We appreciate what they do for us.</p>
<p>I want to associate myself as well with what the hon. the Leader of the House said about our Whips. We know we could not manage without them, although very often one would like to be rid of them! They perform an extremely important task for us in this Upper House, and we say thank you very much to them for the responsible task they perform and for their friendly co-operation and guidance.</p>
<p>To all hon. Senators I also want to say: Goodbye. Have a good rest and be assured of our good wishes when we say we hope we see you all again in good health next year.</p>
<p>I have purposely left one person to the last Over a drink last night someone asked me if I knew how old Hardie Muller was? I said, no, I did not know. He is not a woman and he will not mind if I say how old he is. To be able to make the contribution he makes, at the age of 80, in the way he did, is something to marvel at. [Interjections.] I may be a few months out; but that is what I was told. I admire him for being able to do what he does at his age; he is there at every stage we need him, and he does it with so much competence. I want to tell my friend that we appreciate what he does for us. We appreciate his feelings for his friends. I have never seen him angry. Many of my colleagues get angry&#x2014;so do I. I know that the hon. the Minister can also get angry. But I have never seen the hon. Senator Muller angry.</p>

If I have left anybody out, Mr. President, I assure them that I did not do so deliberately. We do not want to spend too much time on this. Once again my best wishes and many thanks to everyone who has helped us.</p>

<p>Mr. President, allow me a few minutes to convey my sincere thanks to the persons mentioned by both the hon. the Leader of the House and the hon. Senator Oelrich.</p>
<p>I associate myself fully with their remarks about our present State President. He spent a long time in the Chair you now occupy, Sir. I do not think it is necessary to elaborate on that. His presence here definitely contributed to maintaining the dignity of this House.</p>
<p>To you, Mr. President my congratulations once again. I hope that as you are now in a more peaceful atmosphere in which you will really have more time to relax, you will return in full and good health.</p>
<p>†I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to the Leader of the House for the courtesy he has shown to me as a one-man party. I very much appreciate the way in which he has always treated me and the assistance that he has always given me. The position of a one-man party could be very difficult if the Leader of the House was not of the disposition that he is.</p>
<p>*I should also like to express my appreciation to the Whips on both sides of the House who have always been so kind to me and have always helped to keep me informed of what was happening. I also want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for his kindness.</p>
<p>We are all grateful to Mr. Victor and his staff for the way they always help us with any problems we might have. From the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you to them. I also want to thank the service officers who are always so good and take so much trouble to do for us what they think we would like to have done. To the South African Police who do such good work, and for their friendliness to us, I also want to say thank you. We can surely say that the police we have here contribute greatly to improving the goodwill there should be between the public and the police. I am sure that they make a fine contribution in this respect and I have the highest appreciation for what they do.</p>
<p>To the Press and other media I also want to say thank you for the part they play here.</p>
<p>I should also like to express my appreciation to the hon. Senator Muller for the fine way in which he presides, particularly during this session when for a long period he had to act as President of this Senate. I can assure him that my party and I have the highest appreciation for the service he has performed.</p>
<p>Although we do not always agree with one another, I want to assure hon. Senators that I enjoy their company, even the hon. Senator Van Schoor who feels I must say something special about him.</p>
<p>It has been a pleasure for me to sit here in my second year of independence. As we say in English: &#x201C;I am the envy of most of my hon. co-Senators.&#x201D; I have enjoyed my stay here and I trust that when we do leave this hon. Upper House, we will leave it with no regrets.</p>

Senator Du Toit and to all the other hon. Senators for the very friendly way in which they have received me here. I should also like to associate myself with the good wishes to the Secretariat and to all the people here who make our lives comfortable, e.g. in regard to the serving of tea and all the other small things which make it possible for one to lead a pleasant life. We have the highest appreciation for all the work these officials do.</p>
<p>I want to express my special and sincere appreciation to the hon. Senator Muller who, after I had contracted a throat infection a few days ago, was so willing and kind and ready to take over my duties. I am not used to having other people do my job but this was a wonderful gesture of friendship.</p>
<p>I also want to thank the Secretary to Parliament for the assistance he has given me in connection with the formal duties of the Chair. My thanks too to the Chief Whip of the National Party and the Chief Whip of the Opposition who welcomed me in such a very friendly fashion here and made me feel as if I had been here for years.</p>
<p>†I should like to say that although hon. Senators differ in political affiliation in this hon. Senate, we all have one golden thread that binds us to one thing that we have in common, and that is a belief in the beauty and the goodness of South Africa and the belief that we can in some small way contribute something to the enhancement of community life in South Africa.</p>
<p>I should like to wish all the members of the Senate a very restful recess. I wish them a pleasant time and I hope that their health may be sustained. May they have spiritual rejuvenation and may they all come back next year entirely refreshed. Thank you very much.</p>

<li>(a) Compensation is paid in accordance with a prescribed tariff varying between 2,6c and 15,8c per kilometre, depending on the type of vehicle and the engine swept volume thereof.</li>
<li>(b) Compensation is paid where a member uses his private vehicle at his own discretion where no public and/or state-owned vehicles are available, or with the approval of his commanding officer if public and/or state-owned vehicles are available but the use thereof is not practicable, on condition that under the circumstances the most economic arrangements were made and the circumstances necessitating such action are clearly shown in his claim for compensation.</li>

<li>(3) Yes, but this was decided against because the purchase price and maintenance of motor cycles almost amount to the same as that of light motor vehicles.

<question by="#bozas" to="#minister of foreign affairs">
<num>25.</num>
<from>Senator A. BOZAS</from>
<p>asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs:</p>
<p>Whether the State has at any time (a) financed or (b) aided (i) the publishers of the magazines <i>To The Point</i> and <i>To The Point International</i> or (ii) any other firm or organization connected with these publications; if so, (aa) what amounts were involved in each year and (bb) what benefit accrued to the State.</p>
</question>
<answer by="#minister of foreign affairs" as="bozas">
<from>The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:</from>
<p>In general the reply is the same as that furnished to Question 2 of Friday, 23 February 1979, in the House of Assembly and which reads as follows:</p>
<p>If I have to reply to every question on the disbursement of special funds on individual projects, everything being done in terms of existing legislation risks exposure by a process of elimination. The practical effect of that would be that the objective of the legislation of this Parliament would be frustrated and its right of existence vitiated.</p>
<p>Since the Information issue has assumed such wide dimensions it is conceivable that doubt will have arisen on the part of the public over measures of control over disbursement of public funds for covert projects. The most important factor to allay concerns is effective accountability. A heavy onus would therefore rest on us to employ a method which would satisfy this requirement without harming the interests of the public which these projects are intended to promote.</p>
<p>You will recall that it was in response to a specific need that <i>inter alia</i> a Special Account for the Department of Foreign Affairs was established by Act No. 38 of 1967, with the full endorsement of the then Opposition. When it has been determined that a given project promotes the interests of South Africa and that proper measures have been taken to ensure that the project is administered without any form of misappropriation of official funds or irregularity it is difficult to understand why divulgence is insisted upon. In terms of the legislation which I have referred to, a system of control accounting and internal auditing has been established in conjunction with the Auditor-general and the Treasury. A proper procedure has been prescribed to regulate the authorization of all expenditures with precision. The regulations and discipline applied in the handling of public funds in the Special Account go even further than required by the Act.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that, as in the case of all other funds, Parliament&#x2019;s financial watchdog, the Auditor-general, currently has complete access to the disbursement of funds in the Special Account and of the Information Service.</p>
<p>The Government&#x2019;s contention is that it is precisely because of the covert nature of the projects that we should exercise even greater care to ensure that irregularities do not occur. You will agree that, where there is no evidence of financial abuse or irregularities in the administration of a project the Government should be granted the freedom of action to decide on the method of execution which, according to its judgement, will best promote the interests of the country.</p>
<p>In the evaluation of each project a distinction should be drawn between the project and its execution. Should successful implementation be dependent upon nondisclosure it would be not only irresponsible to expose projects but disclosure could be harmful to the interests of South Africa. It would be especially in conflict with our interests if disclosure could harm relations between South Africa and a foreign country or well disposed organizations and individuals in a foreign country.</p>
<p>The projects which have already been evaluated and approved by the Pretorius Committee, are nevertheless still being subjected periodically to the test of effectiveness. The principle of co-ordinated action has also now been extended to include participation by the National Security Council which sets guidelines. Where it is found that a given project could be supported openly without compromising its effectiveness it will be disclosed, as was the case with the Institute for Plural Societies at the University of Pretoria. Two further examples are the Institute of Strategic Studies at the University of Pretoria and the Centre for International Politics at the University of Potchefstroom. In both instances it was decided to proceed openly with financial support of these institutions should they wish such support to be continued.</p>
<p>In this spirit I wish to appeal to our media for co-operation. Should there be the slightest evidence or irregularity I would not expect such information to be suppressed. On the contrary, we have a Commission of Inquiry to whom such evidence could be directed. The Auditor-General is an established channel available to investigate such matters.</p>
<p>I also wish to add the reply I furnished to Question 14 of Friday 30 March 1979 in the House of Assembly:</p>
<p>In order to withstand the psychological campaign against the Republic it is necessary to analyse the onslaught on a continuing basis and to devise counter action.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the projects by the Pretorius Committee and the Information Service of South Africa has disclosed that the present projects do not serve our national interest in the most effective manner. I have therefore decided to terminate with effect from 1 April 1979 all confidential and sensitive projects of the former Department of Information which have not after reconsideration already been implemented on a new basis. In their place newly formulated counter measures which will serve South Africa&#x2019;s interests more appropriately will be instituted. In this process the services and expertise of new associates and proven experts and organizations will be utilized.</p>
<p>It is the Government&#x2019;s view not to desert those who are working for the interests of South Africa by divulging existing confidential associations. This applies also to projects which will be discontinued. I am prepared to give the Information-spokesmen of Opposition parties insight into the state of those projects in force on 31 March 1979.</p>

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE:</from>
<ol>
<li>(1)
<ol>
<li>(a)
<ol>
<li>(i) In terms of Proclamation 1332 of 1976, promulgated in <i>Government Gazette</i> 5242 of 6 August 1976 Lots 1 to 67 of Reserve 7A (Mangete) and Lots 1 to 12 of Reserve 9 (Emoyene) were designated for allocation to the descendants of the late John Dunn.</li>
<li>(ii) Lots 1, 3, 14, 41, 48, one fourth undivided share in Lot 29, one fifth undivided share in Lot 37 and one fourth undivided share in Lot 58, all of Reserve 7A (Mangete) as well as Lot 1 of Reserve 9 (Emoyene) have already been transferred to the interested parties.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>(b)
<ol>
<li>(i) Unknown. The Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is only concerned with the issue of deeds of grant in terms of Section 19 of the said Act.</li>
<li>(ii) Lots 2, 4 to 13, 15 to 28, three fourths&#x2019; undivided share in Lots 29 and 30 to 36, four fifths&#x2019; undivided share in Lots 37 and 38 to 40, 42 to 47, 49 to 57, three fourths&#x2019; undivided share in Lots 58 and 59 to 67 of Reserve 7A (Mangete) as well as Lots 2 to 12 of Reserve 9 (Emoyene) must still be transferred.</li>
</ol></li></ol></li>
<li>(2) Deeds of Grant can only be issued to persons who are still alive and to whom land has be allocated in terms of the Act or in the case of death to the living descendants of such a person. The latter must submit a sworn affidavit to the effect that they are the beneficiaries in terms of the Act. The responsibility to obtain these affidavits vest in the Chairman of the John Dunn Descendants&#x2019; Association as well as attorneys who act on behalf of such beneficiaries. Finalization of the matter is hampered by the fact that a large number of the descendants cannot easily be traced and it is therefore impossible to indicate at this stage when all transfers will be effected.</li>
