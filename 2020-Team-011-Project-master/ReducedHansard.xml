                        <p>Mr. Chairman, before the debate on this particular clause was adjourned, I had indicated the objection of this side of the House to the withdrawal of the war risk clause from any life policy at all. In discussions the hon. the Minister has indicated that this was perhaps not altogether fair on the particular companies who had entered into the group life cover on the basis that they could change the conditions of the policy at any time. Nonetheless, I think it is incumbent upon us to ensure that people who are doing their national service and guarding our country and our future should be covered and that they should know that they are covered. Therefore, I move the following amendments standing in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

                            <br/>may require an increased premium to cover any war risk on the life of any member of the group.
                        </block>
                        <p>The purport of these amendments is to ensure that the war risk cover remains, but it does give the company holding the group life cover the option of increasing the premium to cover any particular extra risk which it has not bargained for. I feel that this adequately safeguards the interests of both the company and the insured person. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept the amendments.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I have given careful consideration to these amendments and I am afraid I have some difficulties with them. I wish to say immediately that there is of course no question that there are types of cover available to ex-servicemen now and that many of them are in fact covered in some way or other. As I explained previously, we are not satisfied with the overall position. That is why the Registrar of Insurance has taken the initiative for some time now, in consultation with the Department of Defence and the insurance industry, to thrash out what we believe will be a very satisfactory insurance policy. They have made very good progress and we shall be in a position to announce this scheme quite soon. There is, therefore, no question about the importance of this matter to this side of the House.</p>
                        <p>As far as group policies are concerned, when we last discussed this a few days ago, I explained our difficulty. If there is a contract between an insured and an insurer in which it is stipulated that that policy can be amended or even cancelled, then it is not for the State 
                            <i>ex post facto</i> to interfere and to try to upset that contract. That would be completely wrong. That is one of the main difficulties we have in trying to change this.
                        </p>
                        <p>Coming to the amendments of the hon. Senator Bozas, it seems to me that what he has in mind is that sections 38 and 38A will apply to group policies except that the premium can be increased in respect of the war clause, as we call it. As I say, I have difficulties here. Apart from the necessity to alter premiums, to exclude group policies from sections 38 and 38A, my difficulties are really twofold. Firstly, section 38(5) provides that an insurer, who relies on the provisions of section 38(3) and in doing so does not meet a claim in respect of the war risk which may be excluded, namely, service outside the Republic or anywhere in an aircraft, shall refund the premiums paid to the member concerned. This treatment is obviously not possible in respect of group life policies where no reserves are accumulated out of the very nature of the policy unlike the case of normal life insurance policies. Secondly, section 38A contains in effect a similar provision in subsection (1) which compels insurers to pay out in cases where the military risk is excluded an amount at least equal to premiums paid. This provision also militates against the concept of group life policies where no reserves are accumulated and therefore cannot be given effect to.</p>
                        <p>I am quite sure that we do not differ in our approach, but the hon. Senator&#x2019;s amendments are impractical because in fact they give a quality to these policies which does not exist. It means therefore that the insurance company itself is not in a position to make these financial provisions.</p>
                        <p>Having taken full account of this interesting discussion my approach is that we should approve of the position as it is now being proposed and let us put this new policy into operation as soon as possible, which is our whole objective. I hope the hon. Senator will agree with me when I say that the proposed insurance policy while including certain qualities of group policies, will go further and will meet the requirements extremely well. I am sorry that I have these practical difficulties with the amendments.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the difficulties of the hon. the Minister but I come back to the position of the young man who has started work and has become interested in a group life policy. Because he has not been told otherwise, he is under the impression that his life is covered and so he does not take other precautions to cover his life. This is not only theory because I know what happens in practice. I wonder how many hon. Senators in this Chamber have read in detail the contract provisions of their life policies. I would say not even 20%, and this is the problem. The agent comes along and says: This is a group life policy which the company has negotiated. For this and that premium you can have your life covered. The person then just signs. He is totally unaware that the war risk clause can be excluded. He is totally unaware that the policy can be cancelled. During the Second Reading debate I said that some of these people are taken for king-size rides. I say this advisedly. Mr. Chairman, I feel if any company is going to opt out of the war risk clause, then they must give due and timeous notice to the person concerned. If the hon. the Minister is unable to accept the amendment&#x2014; he has indicated that he has difficulties and I appreciate them&#x2014;and the clause is going to go through as it is in the Bill, I ask him to ensure that the registrar issues instructions one way or another to all companies that if they are going to evade the war risk, they will have to give notice to that effect in writing by registered post to the particular person whose life is insured. At least then those people will know that their lives are not covered against war risk and will have to take appropriate action.</p>

                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I must add my voice to the plea to the hon. the Minister to consider this amendment put by the hon. Senator Bozas. The hon. the Minister conceded when we last debated this matter that the whole intention of the amendment to section 38 and the insertion of section 38A, was to provide for the protection of servicemen, of persons doing military service in the service of their country. I put it to the hon. the Minister that last year when we amended section 38, we did in fact interfere with the contractual relationship between an insurer and a person who had taken out insurance when we provided that there should be no increase in premium and that there should be no deletion of the war clause. But there was at that stage an interference in what was an existing contractual relationship in many cases.</p>
                        <p>I submit that what we are asking now is simply that that principle should be extended again. Let us look at the particular nature of the insurance policies we are considering. These are policies known as group life policies which are issued by certain firms to certain groups of persons who are connected in one way or another, generally through employment. Because of the advantage which the company has of being able to sell its policy to a large group of people and because of administrative savings, the insurer allows it at a lower premium. I do not believe that there is any other benefit which pertains to the persons who are insured, other than a financial one; it is a pecuniary benefit they derive in the form of lower premiums. That point was made very clearly by the hon. the Minister the other day, and let me say right away that we accept this. Therefore, the second part of the amendment moved by the hon. Senator Bozas to allow the insurer to put himself in a position where he should be compensated for the additional cover which he is now asked to take, means that there is in fact an interference in the contract which has been struck between the insurer and the insured.</p>

                        <p>No, not by the Government. What I said was that the amendment moved by the hon. Senator Bozas will in fact entail an interference in that contract between the insurer and the insured. We accept that; that is what we intend. But we believe that as long as you compensate the person whose interests are affected by the interference, that interference will be justified. Secondly, we believe that this interference is justified by the exceptional circumstances with which we are dealing, and those are the circumstances where a young person is in the service of his country, defending his country, in time of war.</p>
                        <p>Under those circumstances, Sir, I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister. If he has not had time to consider this amendment fully we will accept that situation and we will not press it now. But perhaps he will at least give us an undertaking that he will have another look at it, that he will ask his advisers to have a look at it in the light of the fact that while we are interfering with a contractual relationship in the amendment we are allowing the person whose interests are prejudiced to compensate or recompense himself for that prejudice by increasing the premiums. I ask the hon. the Minister to look at it again before he takes this Bill to the Other Place.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to meet the hon. Opposition on a matter like this because there is no difference in our approach. I can however assure the hon. Senator Bozas and the hon. Senator Webber that I do have serious practical difficulties. We have given considerable attention to this question from the moment we first saw the amendment. I have been in personal touch with the registrar and his office and they also looked at it very thoroughly this morning. I have since talked to them again. I would like to direct the attention of the hon. Senator Webber to the amendment effected last year, i.e. the insertion of section 38A. That did not, of course, interfere with any signed contract between an insurer and an insured. It would be wrong on the part of the Government unilaterally, after the event, to change a long-term insurance policy between an insured and an insurer by passing legislation subsequently to provide that a clause in that policy had to be changed.</p>

                        <p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? As I understood the amendment last year to section 38&#x2014;not section 38A; section 38A was a new section that was inserted&#x2014;it precluded an insurer from enforcing the no military service provision in an insurance policy contracted before 30 June 1978.</p>

                        <p>That was section 38 but section 38A gave the insurer the discretion, from that date onwards, to decide whether or not he would include the war risk clause. Some include it and some do not. What we are aiming at in the insurance policy that is now being fashioned is, in fact, to provide what will be compulsory insurance for these people on favourable terms. That is the whole object.</p>
                        <p>I am quite prepared to look at this again, Mr. Chairman. I am prepared to talk once again to my advisers, as the hon. Senator Webber calls them, and if I can find any way of amending this in the spirit of this proposal without arbitrarily trying to upset what is in fact a contract between the insurer and the insured, I will do it. I cannot give an absolute assurance but I will certainly look at it again and if that is possible in the light of further consideration, I will move the amendment in the Other Place. But that is as far as I can possibly go.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, let me say right at the outset that I do not expect a reply from the hon. the Minister, but I rise merely to place on record our attitude towards this particular clause. This is something which we welcome as a tremendous step forward; it is in line with other changes that have been brought about in Government thinking. We have the situation now for the first time where a Black member of a pension fund may obtain loans from that pension fund in order to provide a home for his family. Sir, we welcome this; we believe this is a step in the right direction and we hope that we will see a lot more of this type of legislation for which, I may add, we have been asking for a long time.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, this clause which amends section 18 of the Banks Act could almost be called a barometer of the economic climate of the country. I see the hon. the Minister nods. I assume that he has taken my point there. The hon. the Minister has the power either to stimulate the economy or, if it is running too hot, to cool it down, and this is the clause that he uses either by adding money into the economy or by taking it out.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that it is necessary right now for the hon. the Minister to increase this amount and, in actual fact, he has decreased it. There is in fact a surfeit of money in the Government coffers if we are to believe what we are told, but what is needed at the moment is encouragement to the private sector to get on with the business of developing the country. For that to happen it must have finance available. Finance must be available for development and that is precisely what the hon. the Minister intends with this amendment to subsection (1) of section 18.</p>
                        <p>The new subsection (2) to section 18 of Act 23 of 1965 proposes that&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">The Minister may from time to time by notice in the 
                            <i>Gazette</i> alter the percentages mentioned in subsection (1).
                        </block>
                        <p>I put it to the hon. the Minister that he has a responsibility to Parliament and Parliament has a responsibility to the banks and to the public of South Africa. Therefore I feel that we can justify the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s asking for this power to alter the percentages because of the system that we have in this country where Parliament disbands for six or seven months in the year and the executive is left to run the country. He is not unreasonable in asking for the power the alter this rate at any time. I believe, however, that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s power to do so should also be subject to the control of Parliament because, as I say, he has a responsibility to Parliament. We feel therefore that he should not have an unfettered power to increase the prescribed amount that banking institutions shall maintain in prescribed investments. We believe that he should be limited to the maximum amount which he has applied up to date, and that is the figure of 15% which stands in the Act at the moment.</p>
                        <p>We believe further that when the hon. the Minister exercises this discretionary power he should report to Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity. In this regard I submit that his reporting to Parliament is one thing but the opportunity of Parliament to debate the use of that discretionary power is another matter. It is for that reason that I wish to move amendment No (2) which stands in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">On page 22, after line 56, to add:
                            <br/>(3) Any alteration made under the provisions of subsection (2) before the date upon which Parliament meets for the first time for the dispatch of business in any session during which the Minister introduces the Appropriation Bill shall, unless Parliament otherwise provides, lapse thirty days after the end of the session during which the Minister introduced such Bill, but without detracting from the validity of such alteration before it has so lapsed.

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I would not like to say that the amendments moved by the hon. Senator Webber are unreasonable. I do not say so at all. I think the hon. Senator Webber has put his case perfectly reasonably, if I may say that too. Of course, the last thing that one wants to do here is to by-pass Parliament. That is not in my mind here at all. In the light of experience over many years, we want to see how we can devise these things so that they operate reasonably smoothly and with a certain flexibility that we have found to be extremely valuable. It is interesting that for instance the International Monetary Fund from time to time sends out missions to member countries to look at the economy. The IMF reserves the right to put out reports and recommendations to the governments of member countries from time to time, and that is what they have done to us. In last year&#x2019;s report, which in our opinion was an extremely valuable report, the International Monetary Fund in fact commented on the very little discretion a Minister of Finance has in South Africa to alter any financial ratios, taxes or whatever. They actually recommended that we should do something about it, even to the extent of giving the Minister of Finance powers to alter certain taxes. I was not prepared to accept that recommendation. Taxes, after all, are obligatory imposts imposed by Parliament on the population, and in my view one has to be very careful not to put the power to change those taxes too easily into a Minister&#x2019;s hands. All we did in that regard was to take the power to enable the Minister of Finance to alter loan levies between sessions of Parliament because that is not strictly a tax. A loan levy is really a loan which has to be repaid within a certain period at interest. It is true that it is a compulsory loan, but it is not a tax in the sense of a compulsory impost that one never sees again. I merely mention that because it is part of the philosophy.</p>
                        <p>In this particular case, the hon. Senator is quite right, this is an important issue because, after all, what would happen if a government were going to run wild and simply say to a pension fund or to insurers or banks: &#x201C;You have been making available so much of your investments to the Government in this way through prescribed investments, for instance 15%, but from tomorrow it will be 20%&#x201D;. That could cause havoc. But, obviously, that is the last thing we wish to do. All we are trying to do here is to introduce a certain measure of flexibility so that the Minister can, when changing conditions make it important to do so, take some of these steps quickly.</p>
                        <p>In the case of insurers and pension funds I have not tried to take these powers, the reason being that there we have an advisory committee that concentrates on long-term business which, of course, is the business that accumulates these huge funds, and the advisory committee has not made any move to advise me to do this. Until the advisory committee feels that in the case of insurance and pension funds, which are the very big ones, these steps should be taken, I am reluctant to raise the matter and that is why I have left well alone.</p>
                        <p>But the banks are in a rather different category and the registrar informs me that the banks have no objection to this. We have kept these ratios rather low and we want to continue to keep them low. In fact, we shall be confirming the reduction of last year if this Bill is passed and, obviously, unless conditions become extremely tight financially, I would certainly not wish to raise these percentages. In fact, it can only be to our advantage to reduce these ratios because it gives a bit more stimulation to the economy and it certainly means that one is leaving more money in the hands of the private sector, which is what I am very keen to do.</p>
                        <p>So I do not think there is any danger that we can go the wrong way in this respect, but all of us in the financial authority&#x2014;as we call it&#x2014;in Government feel that the time has arrived that where the banks are not concerned about this we should take the further discretion to be more flexible. The Minister should be given more flexibility and it is in that sense that we are doing this. I must say that we regard this as being of some importance in the general formulation of financial policy. It is certainly not an attempt on my part in any way to steer this outside Parliament. In fact there are many opportunities in Parliament in budget debates and on other occasions to raise a matter of this kind if there is any unease about it. I hope the hon. Senator will see it in that light. Without the trade or the industry itself approaching me, I certainly do not wish to interfere with the current position of the big savers, viz. the insurers and the pension funds, and that is why I have left them severely alone.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. the Minister for that clear and concise explanation of the attitude of the Government. Whilst we feel that these amendments are essential we are not going to press the issue, but I think a word of warning would be timely right now to the hon. the Minister. I am going to cite a particular case and I cannot recollect whether he was in fact the Minister of Finance at the time. There is, therefore, no question of a personal blame being attached.</p>
                        <p>From what he said just now, the hon. the Minister will appreciate the untold harm that can be done to the economy, to business and to business confidence within the Republic by the injudicious use of this power. I want to quote the example of Marshall Industrials, a firm which was large in Natal. The hon. the Minister will have a personal knowledge of this firm. This firm went into liquidation through liquidity problems which were created by the banks calling in certain overdraft facilities because the banks had been forced to do so by higher authority through the Reserve Bank, starting with the Minister of Finance. In that case we had the situation where 22 000 people were suddenly thrown out of employment. But the situation today is such that not only are all the shareholders going to get their money back but they are also going to get a dividend. There was nothing wrong with the company at all except for the one question of liquidity. Its liquidity problem was caused directly by action through the banks. That is the sort of example I just want to draw to the attention of the hon. the Minister and to say to him that a heavy responsibility rests on him. In the past it was on Parliament, but that responsibility now rests on him. I know that the country will be looking to him to exercise that responsibility judiciously.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I take the point but in fairness I would say that that situation in respect of Marshall Industrials did not arise as a result of prescribed investments. I would like to draw the hon. Senator Webber&#x2019;s attention to the fact that a similar kind of provision and approach, a very important one, exists in the case of the Reserve Bank in determining the liquid asset requirements of banks. That is not put before Parliament and the reason is that it is regarded as a highly technical financial matter in respect of which I think probably the whole financial world would feel the Reserve Bank is acting with absolute discretion and responsibility. I hope very much that the hon. Senator will agree that if it can be continued on this limited basis just for the banks, we can do so with equal responsibility on that score. I am glad the hon. Senator feels that he does not have to press this, but I wish to repeat that I certainly take the point the hon. Senator raised.</p>

                        <p>Yes. I wish to pose the following question to the hon. the Minister. Does the hon. the Minister believe that the principle that building societies should in fact become developers of land is a good one? I have no firm convictions in this regard except that the thought comes to mind that if building societies do become large-scale developers there will be less funds available for the normal borrower, viz. the private householder who wishes to build or buy. Building societies could justifiably say to them that they had used all their available funds for developing their own schemes. This thought worries me quite considerably and I would like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s opinion on it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I am very glad the hon. Senator raised that, because that is not the intention. Many building societies, as the hon. Senator knows, have their own property development companies. Provision for this is made in clause 32(b). This clause seeks to provide for special cases, viz. when a building society finds that there are arrears on loans affecting vacant land and that it has to buy back that land. The question then arises as to what to do with that vacant land. Many building societies have difficulties in disposing of these rather useless assets. Representations have been made for some time that in those cases where they are obliged to repossess land and they are not able to sell it, they should be allowed to build on it so that the opportunity of selling it will be so much better. It is in those restricted cases that we thought we ought to give in to their representations.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President I rise to raise a small matter with the hon. the Minister, a matter that I have in fact discussed with him from time to time. My purpose in raising the matter now is to have it placed on record so that people who do read Hansard can at least have a look at some of the things we might say about it and form their own opinion.</p>
                        <p>The matter refers to the special riot insurance cover which was agreed to earlier in the session. I should like to bring the difficulties that have been experienced in regard to the rating scale of this particular type of insurance publicly to the notice of the hon. the Minister. I have already done so privately. There is a special association handling this insurance, and it is composed mainly of insurance people from whom the hon. the Minister takes his advice. In raising the subject I intend no criticism of the hon. the Minister or the officials dealing with this matter.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty first arose when this association put out a list of rates and, in doing so, it unfortunately included a racial connotation. It talked about different rates for different areas, and specifically made it clear that there were special rates for African areas, Coloured areas, Indian areas and White areas. This caused a great deal of concern, particularly among the Indian community of Durban. As the hon. the Minister knows, there are very many Indian businesses in Durban. I think they certainly outnumber the number of White businesses there. They felt that this was an unnecessary introduction of an unfortunate political aspect; in other words, insurance was to be rated on race rather than on risk which is what should have been the case.</p>
                        <p>This point has been argued among the insurance community for some time, but it now transpires that while, for argument&#x2019;s sake, a White rate will be a particular percentage, the rate for a similar risk in a Black area will be five times that of the White rate, and in an Indian area three times that of the White rate. It might well be said that risks in these particular areas are greater than they are in the White areas and one would not argue that from an underwriting point of view, but where the problem arose was in regard to what in fact constituted a White area and what constituted a non-White area. The association decided that the best way to do this would be to follow the Group Areas Act. It made the point that if an area was classified for a particular group area in terms of the Group Areas Act, that would be the classification they would apply.</p>
                        <p>They have now issued a list which they say they have obtained from the Government setting out the various proclaimed group areas for rating purposes. As far as Natal is concerned, for the information of the hon. the Minister I should like to point out that they say Grey Street is an Indian group area. Now, the hon. the Minister will not mind if I quote from the letter he wrote to me. This was information given to him. He pointed out that an Indian property located in a White area would carry the White rate and, conversely, a White property located in an Indian area would carry the Indian rate. In his letter he stated specifically that Grey Street would carry the White rate. Of course, Mr. President, this is completely contrary to the information now passed on to all the insurance companies which puts Grey Street in an Indian area.</p>
                        <p>I want the hon. the Minister to appreciate that I am not quarrelling with him in any way in this matter. What I am trying to convey to him is that there is a good deal of confusion in regard to the rating of this type of insurance. I think it should be cleared up one way or the other. I am very happy with the letter the hon. the Minister wrote me. I hope that that is the way in which it will be done and I think this is the way in which it should in fact be done. One cannot just take a proclaimed group area and say that it will be subject to a certain rate because, when one looks at the list, one sees too that Kloof, Natal, is stated to be an Indian area. Well, it could be Indian and it could be White; Kloof is divided into different parts. Westville, for instance, has an Indian area and a White area. Obviously the instructions are most misleading and I think that this matter must be cleared up fairly rapidly.</p>
                        <p>There is another problem connected with this, Sir, and I have personal experience of it. If one rates this insurance incorrectly, one cannot cancel the coupon. The companies say that they cannot cancel the coupon, and the premium has to accompany the coupon itself. Many instances of incorrect rating are in fact taking place and all I can say to the hon. the Minister is that I do hope he can have this matter cleared up as quickly as possible because daily this type of insurance is being written and underwritten and in many cases there must be dozens of mistakes made almost daily, which are, in fact, very difficult to correct later.</p>
                        <p>As long as I have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that he will go further into this matter, I shall be content to leave it at that.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I think we have come to the end of what has been a very important debate during which we have discussed the various financial institutions. Although the title of the Bill seems innocuous, Financial Institutions Amendment Bill, I think the hon. the Minister will agree that it is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation he brings before Parliament annually.</p>
                        <p>We had our say during the Second Reading and during the Committee Stage and I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that we appreciate the fact that he has seen the point of view of this side of the House and he appreciates the problems we have put forward. I would welcome his further attention, as he has promised, particularly to the proposed amendments, to see whether something cannot in fact be done or some amendment moved in the Other Place to protect the war risk cover of those young people serving their country.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I should like to express my appreciation to the hon. Opposition for their positive attitude in regard to this measure. I agree with the hon. Senator Bozas that this is really an important measure; it contains amendments to at least five very important Acts, and I also regard it as a very important piece of legislation. I must say that it is very helpful to this side of the House, and therefore the Government if the Opposition adopts such a positive and constructive attitude, and I shall give careful consideration to the opinions that have been expressed here. In the one specific case, if it appears possible to do anything about it when we have reconsidered it, I shall raise it in the Other Place.</p>
                        <p>†As far as the hon. Senator Winchester is concerned, he has raised what is an important point affecting a new kind of insurance in our experience, i.e. riot cover, and the question of the rating as it affects different areas and different types of property. I shall certainly have that matter investigated very carefully. This association or new company is still very new and there is no doubt that in some respects they are still feeling their way. However, I fully agree with the hon. Senator that if there are anomalies which can be cleared up immediately then the sooner that is done the better. I shall have that investigated immediately, Mr. President, and I shall keep the hon. Senator informed.</p>

                        <p>There is another reason for this, Mr. President. I think you will agree, Sir, and I think the hon. House will agree, that there have been some almost earth-shattering events recently. One only has to look at the oil developments lately to realize the implications this could have for our economy and policy. I hope the House will bear with me when I try to give some idea of how we see these matters.</p>
                        <p>Since I introduced my budget in March this year there have been a number of new developments in the world economy as such which have important implications for South Africa and, of course, for our fiscal, monetary and other economic policies.</p>
                        <p>Some of these developments have been unfavourable from our point of view and some favourable. The most important of the unfavourable has been the substantial further increase in world oil prices, particularly on the free market. This increase, which has been accompanied in many countries by actual shortages of liquid fuels, has upset the world economic applecart and sent government economists in most countries back to the drawing boards. The truth is that world economic conditions and prospects have been materially altered by the latest energy crisis, and for most non-oil producing countries this has not been a change for the better.</p>
                        <p>The impact of the new oil situation on the world economy will be inflationary in one sense and deflationary in another. It will be inflationary in the sense that it is bound to exert a marked upward influence on costs and prices in virtually all countries. And it will be deflationary in the sense that it is likely to retard the growth of total real spending by business enterprises and consumers on other goods and services. For this reason it might well serve to slow down and shorten the current moderate cyclical economic upswing in the major industrial countries and to deepen the next recession. The change in the oil situation can therefore be said to have raised the spectre of what is sometimes called &#x201C;stagflation&#x201D; in the world once again.</p>
                        <p>As an important trading nation, South Africa is bound to be adversely affected by both these inflationary and deflationary influences as and when they materialize. The inflationary effects will be felt almost immediately. It is therefore only realistic to expect that the rate of inflation in South Africa in the months ahead will in all likelihood be higher that it would otherwise have been. As Minister of Finance, I am deeply concerned about this prospect. Inflation is an evil which does incalculable harm to the economy and which, as businessmen have increasingly discovered in recent years, does not even have the redeeming feature of being conducive to long run economic growth. With due regard to its other main economic objectives, the Government will therefore redouble its efforts to curb inflation and to mitigate its adverse effects wherever possible. I shall return to this point later.</p>
                        <p>The deflationary effects of the oil price increase will probably be felt by both the world as a whole and South Africa at a somewhat later stage. In the opinion of many experts, the United States is likely to move into a recessionary phase within the next six or twelve months, and in due course the present cyclical upswing in Western Europe should also peter out and be followed by the next downward phase. South Africa, of course, also has a business cycle, and it is well known that this cycle normally lags behind that of Western Europe by up to one year or more. This well established pattern of behaviour, together with the fact that the South African economy is at present in the middle of an upswing which, although moderate, is still gathering momentum, would suggest that our next cyclical downswing is still some way off and that the prospects for the year ahead remain very good.</p>
                        <p>This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that certain other recent developments in the world economy have been extremely favourable from our point of view and have served to strengthen the South African economy in certain fundamental aspects. The basic fact is that the changed oil situation in the world has understandably been accompanied by a changed gold and international currency situation, which has resulted in sharp increases in the prices of gold and certain other &#x201C;store of value&#x201D; commodities such as platinum. Moreover, these increases have occurred not only in terms of United States dollars but in terms of all currencies, including the German mark, the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.</p>
                        <p>What we have witnessed during recent months has, in fact, been a world wide depreciation of currencies against gold. This has not only greatly increased the value of South Africa&#x2019;s gold output but has also raised the value of our official gold reserves in terms of other currencies. Valued at the average market price of the last ten days of May minus 10%&#x2014;that is the official method of gold valuation used in South Africa during the past year&#x2014;the gold holdings of the Reserve Bank at the end of May 1979 amounted to nearly R2 billion, while the bank&#x2019;s gold and other foreign assets as a whole attained the record month-end figure of R2,6 billion.</p>
                        <p>South Africa is therefore in the fortunate position that, unlike many other non-oil-producing countries, it should not experience any significant deterioration in its balance of payments in 1979. On the contrary, despite the expected large increase in the oil import bill, our balance of payments should show another substantial surplus this year, both on current account and in the so-called &#x201C;basic balance&#x201D;, namely the current account plus long-term capital movements. In other words, what we lose on the swings we tend to gain on the roundabouts.</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, impossible to predict our future balance of payments behaviour with any accuracy in a world in which current payments surpluses and deficits are in the process of being reshuffled&#x2014;this is because the oil price increases are affecting some countries much more adversely than others. But the indications are that, in this &#x201C;reshuffling&#x201D;, South Africa, as a major producer of gold, platinum, diamonds and coal, should fare relatively well.</p>
                        <p>The recent behaviour of both the commercial rand and the financial rand clearly supports this conclusion. Since the institution of the new exchange rate system in South Africa towards the end of January this year, the commercial rand has shown an average effective appreciation against all other currencies of about 4%. During this same period the new financial rand has appreciated from about 64 United States cents to levels in excess of 90 cents during the past week, so that the discount on the financial rand has declined from about 46% to the vicinity of 20%. These movements clearly reflect increased foreign confidence and interest in the South African economy and a further strengthening of the underlying balance of payments position. To this must be added the fact that, after rising by R479 million during 1978, the net gold and other foreign reserves&#x2014;that will be the gross figure minus foreign liabilities&#x2014;increased by a further R313 million in the first quarter of 1979.</p>
                        <p>The recent gold developments, including the important monetary role assigned to gold in the new European Monetary System and the decision announced yesterday by the British Government to abolish controls on gold coins, provide further evidence of gold&#x2019;s underlying strength and continuing monetary significance. The views I expressed on this subject in Washington in 1975, after the announcement by the International Monetary Fund of the so-called new &#x201C;understanding&#x201D; on gold, as they called it, and which they said would finally demonetize gold out of the system, have now been completely vindicated.</p>
                        <p>As far as the price of gold is concerned, I wish to reiterate my view that it will in all probability continue to show large fluctuations but that in the long term it should remain on an upward trend. Our fiscal and monetary policies will, however, continue to be based on extremely conservative assumptions regarding the price of gold.</p>
                        <p>I turn now to the implications for our own fiscal and monetary policies of the recent world economic developments.</p>
                        <p>In any assessment of these implications, account must be taken not only of the various influences I have already mentioned, but also of the fact that the policy of financial discipline applied in South Africa during the past three years has resulted in an economic situation which is fundamentally sounder than that of 1975&#x2014;government spending, bank credit and the money supply as a whole are now under much better control and the current account of the balance of payments is showing a record surplus, whereas it showed a substantial deficit in 1975.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances the Government has decided not to deviate from its basic economic and financial policy of &#x201C;growth from strength&#x201D; as announced in the Budget Speech in March this year. Obviously certain sectors of the economy will be adversely affected by the increased prices and reduced supplies of liquid fuels and related products. However, certain other sectors, such as mining, should derive substantial net benefits from the recent developments. The oil problem confronting South Africa is therefore basically one of restructuring production and re-allocating resources. There will have to be marked changes in the patterns and methods of production. It is only realistic to accept that these unavoidable adjustments will take time and may have certain disruptive effects in the short term. On balance, however, we should still be able to attain the desired acceleration of the rate of real economic growth, and our fiscal and monetary policies remain directed towards that objective.</p>
                        <p>This does not mean, of course, that our fiscal and monetary policies will remain completely unchanged in every detail. On the contrary, as and when necessary, these policies will be modified in order to encourage the required restructuring of production and, wherever possible, to attempt to alleviate hardships caused by changes in relative prices and in the distribution of real income.</p>
                        <p>It stands to reason that, in the changed circumstances, the amount and composition of State revenue in the current fiscal year are likely to differ materially from the original Budget estimates. It is probable, for example, that more revenue will be obtained from the mining sector than could have been anticipated, and less from certain other sectors. During the course of the fiscal year there are also bound to be adjustments to the amount and composition of State expenditure, which will be reflected in due course in the additional estimates. Although it is too early to give any firm indications in this regard, these changes might include adjustments to certain subsidies with a view to cushioning some of the adverse secondary effects of the higher oil price. Excessive use of subsidies will, however, have to be avoided. This is not only because of the normal Budget constraints and the need to retain financial discipline, but also because subsidies will hide the real costs of liquid fuels and thereby reduce the incentive to users of these fuels to make the necessary adjustments in the national interest. The latter consideration applies particularly in the case of any subsidies on liquid fuels as such. For these reasons it is desirable that liquid fuel prices should at all times be realistic and market related.</p>
                        <p>Apart from possible steps to alleviate some of the effects of a higher rate of inflation, the need to curb the inflation rate itself will remain a basic consideration in the formulation of official economic policy. To this end, the rates of increase of money supply and government expenditures will be kept at appropriate levels and a high priority will be given to avoiding any re-emergence of demand inflation.</p>
                        <p>As I have emphasized before, however, our present inflation is manifestly not demand inflation. Like the inflation in the world as a whole, it no doubt has its roots in earlier demand inflation caused by excessive money creation and spending. But at present our problem is not one of &#x201C;too much money chasing too few goods&#x201D;. It is a problem of excessive cost increases stemming from such factors as higher fuel prices, unavoidable increases in administered prices, and wage and salary increases in excess of productivity in certain sectors.</p>
                        <p>It would therefore clearly be counter-productive to deviate from our policy of encouraging more rapid economic growth and the creation of more employment opportunities by attempting, through new restrictive fiscal and monetary measures, to reduce real investment and consumption. Such measures are not called for from a balance of payments point of view and would have little, if any, restraining effect on the rate of inflation. But they would reduce the rate of growth, increase unemployment and diminish foreign and domestic confidence in the South African economy.</p>
                        <p>While keeping the changing economic and financial situation under constant review and making such policy adjustments as may become necessary, we shall therefore persist with our basic official strategy of &#x201C;growth from strength&#x201D;. This strategy has already yielded favourable results, and I remain confident that our present economic upswing will continue and that our rate of real economic growth will accelerate further during the period ahead.</p>
                        <p>*Hon. Senators will remember that in my budget speech in the Other Place and on numerous other occasions I emphasized the importance of the work that was being done by the Priorities Committee in order to bring about a more orderly and controlled programme of spending by the public sector of South Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet Committee for Economic Policy decided on 19 August 1976 to establish an inter-departmental committee to inquire into and to make recommendations concerning the priorities that have to be followed in capital spending programmes for State Corporations and institutions, the S.A. Railways and Harbours and the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. The following persons were requested to serve on the committee&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Chairman&#x2014;the Secretary for Finance,
                            <br/>Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister,
                            <br/>General Manager of the South African Railways and Harbours,
                            <br/>Postmaster-General,
                            <br/>Secretary for Mines,
                            <br/>Secretary for Industries.
                        </block>
                        <p>Subsequently the Secretary to the Treasury was co-opted as a permanent member in view of the fact that the committee felt that, in order to make meaningful recommendations concerning the priorities in regard to capital projects by State Corporations and State institutions, it should also have regard to the major capital programmes of State departments themselves as well as those of the provinces. No clashes are envisaged between the functions of the Treasury and the Priorities Committee in view of the fact that the Treasury carries on normally with the task of determining the departmental estimates from year to year. The Priorities Committee will try to take a more long-term view and to have regard to the economy as a whole so that those projects which deserve a high priority can gradually be phased in to the extent as far as they fall within the capital resources of the country and do not exceed the amount allotted to the public sector.</p>
                        <p>During the period between 1974 and 1976 many of us were under the false impression that all our problems had been solved and that Government spending could practically go on unabated. We had to pay the price for that. We had a slow growth rate and a high inflation rate and drastic pruning measures had to be introduced, measures which often cut right down to the bone. Fortunately, we are over the worst and thanks to the co-operation that I received from all my colleagues, from the provinces, local authorities as well as State corporations and state institutions, we are today economically speaking in a much better position than we were then. It would therefore be unwise if we were once again to relax our discipline and drop our guard in respect of public spending. The reason that is advanced for such relaxation, for example, is that we are now suddenly expecting higher revenue from the gold mining industry and that that revenue can consequently be spent freely. It has been very difficult and has called for a great deal of sacrifice to reach the stage we have reached today as far as good growth prospects are concerned, and I intend keeping our economy basically sound and not yielding to any pressure. We simply cannot afford it. However, I should like to add that some of the projects on which we spent considerable amounts in the early years of this decade&#x2014;I have in mind particularly the Sishen-Saldanha railway line, the Saldanha Bay harbour, the Broodsnyersplaas-Ermelo railway line and the Richards Bay harbour complex&#x2014;have been excellent investments because those projects have established export capacity which is coming in very handy at the moment and which is earning the country millions of rands in foreign exchange. But then, other less essential projects should either have been delayed or postponed or even abandoned. By not doing so we made things difficult for ourselves.</p>
                        <p>It is interesting to note that South Africa is not the only country that has experienced these problems. The Australian Government of the mid-&#x2019;seventies made the same mistakes, only much more so, and it was the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser who, shortly after he came into power a few years ago, was able to put the matter in perspective when he said&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Over the past year or so the view has begun to develop that we can have it all without really having to pay for it. But one of the things we&#x2019;ve got to understand is that when politicians promise things, they are not promising anything of their own, because they have nothing of their own to give. They are promising something which is yours, and the more politicians promise, the less there s for you to meet your own needs or your family&#x2019;s needs; the less there is for industry, for investment, and to create jobs needed to improve the real wealth of Australia.</block>
                        <p>That was what Malcolm Fraser said.</p>
                        <p>I intend letting the Priorities Committee play an even more important role in future in the allocation of State funds. In the first instance it has to see to it that there is a gradual decline in the proportionate share of Government investment 
                            <i>ex</i> total investment to more reasonably long-term levels&#x2014;the ratio I have in mind is approximately 40%&#x2014; and secondly, it has to recommend which competing demands should be given priority. I have already received the second report of the committee in which the effect of SASOL III has been taken into account, and I can assure hon. Senators that the future does not appear very rosy. Naturally we have to give preference to strategic projects such as SASOL II and SASOL III as well as to UCOR. After that we have to ensure that the infrastructure keeps pace with the needs of the economy&#x2014;our railways, postal and communications systems, water, power and urban lines of communication, to mention only a few.
                        </p>
                        <p>Whatever savings can be effected on what is spent on national roads, more will have to be spent on urban transport. In view of prevailing circumstances private transport will become more expensive and public transport will have to carry a heavier burden. Only recently suggestions have been made to myself and my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Transport, in connection with the financing of suburban transport and commuter services. We shall attend to this shortly and we hope to come forward with a more co-ordinated plan. But somebody will have to pay for it. As far as power is concerned, huge amounts are required for Koeberg and the next two giant coal power stations which will have to come into operation in the late &#x2018;eighties. We cannot fall behind as far as the provision of water is concerned and we shall have to spend a great deal on our communications system in order to increase productivity and to introduce new and modern techniques. What remains? Precious little, and that will have to be drastically reduced in any case. I trust that as far as this is concerned I shall be able to depend on the full co-operation of all my colleagues, of the Opposition and of all other public sector persons and bodies.</p>

                    <speech by="#oelrich">
                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I should like in the first place to express our appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Finance for the copy of his speech which he sent to us. Secondly, I should like to apologize for the fact that our usual speaker on financial matters is unable to be here today.</p>
                        <p>I do not want to make exceptions, Sir, but I should like to mention certain matters which in the nature of things will come to the fore in my speech. The first point appears on page 13 of the speech of the hon. the Minister, as follows&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Obviously certain sectors of the economy will be adversely affected by the increased prices and reduced supplies of liquid fuels and related products. However, certain other sectors such as mining should derive substantial net benefits from the recent developments.</block>
                        <p>The difference is drawn here between the various sectors. Later in my speech I shall refer to the following point&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">On the contrary, as and when necessary, these policies will be modified in order to encourage the required restructuring of production and, wherever possible, to alleviate hardships&#x2014;I want to underline &#x201C;hardships&#x201D;&#x2014;caused by changes in relative prices and in the distribution of real income.</block>
                        <p>Mr. President, before I proceed with my prepared speech I should like to refer to page 32 where mention is made of the enormous amounts which are required for Koeberg. As you know, Sir, much has been written in recent times in our Press about the concern felt by the public regarding the construction of a nuclear power station on the West Coast of South Africa. I was particularly pleased to read in the supplement to 
                            <i>Die</i>
                            <i>Burger</i> of last Friday or Saturday a very interesting and enlightening article which stated precisely what this power station entailed. I should also like to recommend to my colleagues that they read this article because from time to time questions are put to us as public figures, and if hon. Senators can get a copy of that newspaper and make a study of that excellent exposition, they will all profit from it.
                        </p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, when the budget was discussed during the first week of May and discussions continued during the following week, we ran out of time before I could enter the debate. Consequently I was unable to make my contribution at that particular stage. In a sense that may be a good thing, because much of what I would have said at that stage, will now remain unsaid. I feel, Sir, that every hon. Senator worthy of that name should feel that they have done the image of this hon. House a tremendous disservice by deliberately staging a walk-out to prevent a certain motion from being properly discussed in this hon. House. Much of what I may have said then can now rather be left unsaid. Certain happenings since that particular time, that is about one month ago, have somewhat altered the position, but apparently a great deal more will have to happen before the country will be able to settle down to the formidable tasks facing it. And what concerns me very much indeed at this particular moment are the serious problems that will have to be dealt with on the economic front, in the light of the staggering -increases in oil products announced last week.</p>
                        <p>*Mr. President, I feel that the disruption of our economy as a result of the tremendous increase in fuel prices is one of the worst catastrophies that has befallen us in many years. We are dealing here with the most sensitive artery in the lifeblood of the whole South African economy. It affects every imaginable industry throughout the country. There is not a single branch of our entire economic set-up in the country that can exist without this vitally important commodity, viz. fuel.</p>
                        <p>I can remember a speech made in this Upper House during my first period of office as a Senator. That was in the period 1961-&#x2019;65 when the late Senator George Sutter, a frontbencher on this side of the House, made an earnest appeal to the Government to change its attitude in regard to its internationally unpopular race policy. While discussing the matter, he emphasized with feeling how vulnerable we were regarding our dependence on oil supplies. This has become increasingly obvious now. Sasol I, Sasol II and later Sasol III will bring a measure of relief. Much has been written and speculated as to the possibility of the manufacture of fuel from sugar-cane or other vegetable matter, but this question is still at the castles-in-the-air stage. Anything resulting from this is something for the future and not for the present. We must look at the situation we have today. We must look at the present state of affairs. It is essential that we apply fuel-saving measures. Priorities must also be allocated. This is something which calls for our serious attention and in this regard I should like to refer to a few matters. We must ensure that our economy continues to expand and does not collapse. We must also ensure that inflation does not get completely out of hand. What is especially important is that the food producer must be enabled to put the necessary products on the market at a price which will prevent hunger and misery among the masses.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>In this connection I am reminded of a news item I heard earlier this week on the radio in which it was pointed out that the production costs of maize rose by 17% in 1978, and that with the latest increase in fuel prices this percentage would rise in the coming year to more than 40%. This is going to create an impossible position. Where will the less privileged section of the population find the necessary money to feed themselves and their families? The general tendency recently seems to be for consumer subsidies to disappear. In the present circumstances this is impossible in my view. The lower-income groups will have to be cared for, otherwise there will be chaos. Steps could surely be taken to use some of the profits of the higher gold price to reintroduce consumer subsidies for the lower-income groups, or to provide that coloured fuel, which we had previously, would be made available at lower prices to food producers and food processing institutions who are dependent upon fuel. Attention could even be given to the idea of suspending that portion of the duty on fuel accruing to the State to facilitate the production of food at a more reasonable price for the population.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, this side of the House has for years maintained that consumer subsidies are necessary. We have pleaded for consumer subsidies to make it possible for the lower income groups to buy the necessary foodstuffs for their families over a period of years. I can recall in debate after debate over the years when we were discussing the problems in respect of the prices of agricultural commodities, that it was pointed out how the primary producer was finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet on the prices fixed by the various control boards for their products. We suggested that these prices should be increased and that consumer prices should be subsidized. This was the practice for many years as far as butter is concerned. It also applied to other agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize, until a few years ago when the Government decided that these subsidies should disappear. Whether the Government was influenced by the terrific outcry in the Press every time any one of the control boards announced an increase in the price of any one commodity I do not know. What I have noticed is that each increase in food price raises screaming headlines, but not a word is written when the production costs of producers increase. This only happens in the agricultural journals, but of course they are not as widely read by the general public as the daily Press. I mentioned the instance of what I heard over the radio only a few days ago about the increase in production costs of 17% in 1978 and which, because of the new fuel price, is expected to rise to over 40% in the coming year. I have gone to a lot of trouble to find a cutting of this news item in a newspaper, but without success.</p>
                        <p>I have made the suggestion that steps should be taken to meet this serious situation. For the life of me I cannot see that it would be unfair to claim that the public are entitled to some relief or other out of the increased gold prices. There certainly seems to be a correlation between the escalation in the price of oil and the higher prices paid for gold today. Where the consuming public has to pay so much more for all the oil products it requires, and whereas the State on the other hand is the beneficiary as far as the higher gold price is concerned, I sincerely feel that there is every justification for suggesting that the one increase should be used in the best possible manner to offset the other. To my mind no more deserving case can be made out for the food consuming members of our public, particularly the less affluent sections of the population including all pensioners who are finding the escalating cost of living a tremendous hardship.</p>
                        <p>One of South Africa&#x2019;s top industrialists, Dr. Anton Rupert, said quite a few years ago about our Black homelands and adjacent Black territories that if they do not eat, we will not sleep. I think we can confirm that and add that without oil, industry and commerce will grind to a halt. This would be terribly serious and a catastrophe. It would not only lead to massive unemployment, but to revolution and chaos on a large scale. This reminds one of the words of a former Prime Minister who maintained that if there was one thing that gave him sleepless nights it was the threat of large-scale unemployment amongst the masses in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>I admit that I have presented a very sombre picture of a situation which must be tackled in earnest and without delay. If one has to add another thought to the one I uttered just now about industry and commerce grinding to a halt if there are insufficient quantities of oil, it is that South Africa will then starve as a result of that because we will not be able to produce sufficient quantities of food. I wish to repeat that action is urgently needed. All possible measures to stimulate the economy must be employed without delay, otherwise we are in danger of scaring off investment capital, which will lead to unemployment and all the dangers that that may entail. Steps to lighten the onerous task of the primary producer must receive priority or we will face serious food shortages, not only in the Republic but also in our neighbouring territories, who for long months of every year are totally dependent upon us for food supplies.</p>
                        <p>We must realize that our very survival depends on positive action at an early date. Whatever steps the hon. the Minister of Finance can take to inject more money into the economy, must be done soon to have the maximum effect. Suggestions made earlier on during the budget speeches about an earlier repayment of the longest outstanding loan levy, for instance, would help a great deal. Other good suggestions followed and I want to stress again that in my view the situation in the Republic is extremely serious and requires immediate attention and drastic steps to avoid disaster befalling us.</p>
                        <p>Sir, these are not only my opinions but also those of people I have been talking to over the last couple of days who are very concerned indeed about this terrific hike in the price of our fuel supplies in South Africa. This is something that none of us can take the blame for; it is a world situation.</p>
                        <p>*I am grateful, Sir, that in his speech the hon. the Minister indicated that he was fully aware of certain of these problems. But I did feel that it was necessary for me once again to stress this one particular factor pertinently, this particular section of our industry in South Africa, because I think this is something which is extremely necessary. It is not necessary for me to repeat what I have already said this year regarding supplies to the farmer, the high capital costs involved, etc. I hope the hon. the Minister will kindly give his attention to this matter as he has done in the past.</p>
                    </speech>
                    <speech by="#visser">
                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. J. VISSER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want to associate myself with many of the things the hon. Senator Oelrich has said today. I can only agree with what he has said and later in my speech I shall return to some important points he has raised.</p>
                        <p>I want to start by congratulating the hon. the Minister on having been able in the past year to overcome many of the problems we have been experiencing, and on the success he has achieved with his policy of financial discipline and his policy of growth from strength. When I think of what he said, I can summarize it as follows: What are the priorities? The first priority is to ensure that we have a reasonably fast economic growth rate. That aim is still high on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s list, and he is quite correct, particularly in view of the fact that it is so essential to provide employment opportunities for our fast-growing population. That is one of our problems and in the years that lie ahead it will remain one of our great problems.</p>
                        <p>The second problem connected with it, especially as a result of the increased oil price and in respect of which we have not had any success yet, is the question of inflation. We must in all honesty admit, and I think the hon. the Minister has on occasion admitted it, that the one question in respect of which we have not yet achieved the necessary success is the question of inflation. We have not yet overcome that problem although it did appear some time ago as though we were having some success, even if to a small extent. But now, as result of the increased price of fuel we are realizing afresh how difficult it is to overcome this serious question, how to control it. During the past few years our enemy has been inflation and it remains our enemy number one together with enemy number two, namely the slow rate of our economic growth.</p>
                        <p>It is of particular importance for us to aim at two objectives: We shall have to encourage and achieve a fast economic growth rate and control the rate of inflation at the same time. That is no easy task, Sir, because the one often gives rise to the other. I want to say something that I have already said in the past in this hon. House and that is that we must try to solve one of the problems which we have not yet been able to overcome and which is contributing to this problem of inflation, namely, satisfactory productivity in the South African economy. Over the years I have on various occasions pleaded for that in this hon. House. This afternoon I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance something which I have already asked the hon. the Minister of Labour. We have often discussed this. Cannot we do something more positive? We must have an in-depth look at this matter and I suggest the appointment of a working committee.</p>
                        <p>The third point to which the hon. the Minister has referred is a serious problem&#x2014; we admit that this is very serious problem that has come into existence&#x2014;namely, the redistribution of income that is taking place. On the one hand we have the enormous rise in the price of gold which has assisted us to a large extent in paying the increased price for oil. It has meant increased foreign reserves to us but coupled with that we have the problem of the redistribution of income. The tendency is to give more to those who have and to make it more difficult for those who have not. That is the effect of the increased gold price on the one hand and the increase in the price of fuel on the other hand. This tendency can have a far-reaching effect on the income distribution pattern in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister has rightly referred to that and we shall even have to reconsider many of the things that we did not wish to do in the past, things which we perhaps regarded as evil. One of the questions referred to is the question to which the hon. Senator Oelrich has rightly referred, namely, the question of subsidizing the consumer in some way or other, directly or indirectly. I shall return to this at a later stage.</p>
                        <p>I think this question is one which most certainly deserves serious consideration and I am convinced that the time has arrived for the extremely efficient economists in his department to put their heads together and consult other economists and other branches of industry and departments to see what can be done about it.</p>
                        <p>I want to refer to one other point to which the hon. the Minister has also referred, namely that of a priorities committee. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this because I think it is an extremely wise step. However, I want to put this question to him: Does he not see his way clear to have the agricultural industry represented on that committee? I have a specific reason for asking this. There are three factors in our country and in any other country that produce wealth, namely, industry, agriculture and mining. The hon. the Minister mentioned two of these, namely industries and mining but he omitted agriculture. The agricultural industry is faced with many problems, particularly a shortage of water in certain parts of the country. And it is obvious that a large amount of money will have to be spent on the provision of water. I have in mind particularly the Kalahari with its tremendous potential for food production but which, due to an insufficient supply of water, cannot be developed properly.</p>
                        <p>That brings me to something which I have very seldom raised in this House, particularly on an occasion such as this, but which I have long since wanted to raise. However, for a number of years I have not had the opportunity of doing so and I want to raise it today. As I have said, Sir, there are three factors that produce wealth, two of which are doing fairly well. The mining industry is faring exceedingly well and the position of the industrial sector has improved. It did not suffer very greatly during the recession we have just experienced. Its position did, of course, deteriorate; profitability dropped last year from 21% to 19,6% on shareholder investment. But it remains a highly profitable industry and it is hopefully on the upswing. All the signs seem to indicate that the profits of the companies in South Africa will again be appreciably higher. There are daily reports in the newspapers of the big increases in the profits of big mining houses or large industrial concerns. That is right, that is fine, that is what we want. However, there is one industry of which I cannot say the same and that is the agricultural industry. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister of Finance is here because it is said that in any country the Minister of Finance is the second most powerful person and that is, in fact, the case. That is why it is so important that we have his sympathy, his goodwill and his ear&#x2014;if I may put it that way&#x2014;in respect of a matter which we think is of the utmost importance.</p>
                        <p>I want today to have a more serious look at the Government&#x2019;s priorities and agriculture. I want to say immediately that I am aware and deeply appreciative of what has been done for agriculture in the past. But at the same time I want to say that somewhere along the line there is a misconception. Unfortunately, a large section of the public has a wrong opinion about the agricultural industry. The broad public&#x2014;and perhaps many semi-public bodies if not public bodies&#x2014;have the wrong picture of the agricultural industry. It is not a good picture; we have to admit that. Let me say immediately the agricultural industry itself is largely to blame for this. The agricultural industry has not done enough to make the facts known; the industry has not done enough to collate the facts, to investigate them and to make them public.</p>
                        <p>I want to give hon. Senators a few facts today. I looked at the 1979-&#x2019;80 estimates of expenditure to find out what the Government was contributing to the various industrial sectors. I found that for this financial year the Government had budgeted for a total amount of R734 million in respect of the manufacturing industry&#x2014;that is current plus capital amounts. In respect of the mining industry the amount is R186 million and in respect of the agricultural industry it is R193 million. In other words, the amount in respect of the manufacturing industry is very much higher than in the case of the other two sectors together. Let me say immediately, Sir, that the manufacturing industry deserves it. I have no objection to that whatsoever. If more money had been available I think that even more could have been earmarked for that industry. If one expresses those figures in terms of a yardstick to which I know the Department of Finance attaches great importance, namely the ratio of those figures to the GDP, one gets the following figures: In respect of the manufacturing industry it was R34 million for every R1 million it contributed to the GDP; in respect of the mining industry it was R23 million and in respect of the agricultural industry it was R26 million. When one takes the current amounts the position remains more or less the same, except that the manufacturing industry compares slightly more favourably in that case, but one cannot exclude the capital amount. In the case of the current amounts the figure is R12,4 million for the manufactoring industry, R15,3 million for the agricultural industry and R21,5 million for the mining industry. One must take the totals, Sir, because financial assistance in the form of loans or capital is valuable assistance to the industry concerned. The conclusion is clear. The image of agriculture, namely, that it is very heavily subsidized by the State, is not a true and correct reflection of the actual position. I obtained these figures from the statements of the various Government Departments and re-arranged them in accordance with the department to which they belonged. I discussed the position with various people and no one differed from me. Then this question was put to me: &#x201C;What about the total capital resources that the State has in the Land Bank, etc.? Does that not perhaps favour the agricultural industry?&#x201D; I then found that the total amount spent by the State on the promotion of the manufacturing industry amounted to the sum of R5 503 million as at 28 February. That does not include guarantees. Hon. Senators will remember that provision was made in the Bill we have just passed for guarantees to public industrial corporations to an amount of nearly R300 million. This figure, therefore, is even higher; if the lastmentioned amount is added, the amount is R5 800 million.</p>
                        <p>In the case of agriculture, and here I am taking the Land Bank and the Agricultural Credit Board, the amount is only R2 293 million. From this point of view, therefore, Sir, the agricultural industry is once again not what people believe it to be; the State does not carry the industry to such a large extent; its bread is not buttered on both sides.</p>
                        <p>Something which we often take into account is direct subsidies. The hon. Senator Oelrich spoke about direct subsidies; he spoke about consumer subsidies. I think the Government has set aside an amount of approximately R124 million for that purpose this year. There was a time when we thought we would have to phase it out. We were justified in thinking that, Sir. But as a result of the redistribution of income with its resultant adverse implications and complications, there is no doubt that we shall have to take another look at this position.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister rightly mentioned this in his speech today. I think he was absolutely correct. It is often maintained that it is the agriculturist who gets those subsidies.</p>
                        <p>But he does not get them and it is not right to say that he does. The hon. the Minister has said this on occasion and I applaud him for it. According to the estimates for 1979-&#x2019;80 the manufacturing industry is being directly subsidized to the tune of approximately R119 million, agriculture to the tune of R39 million and mining to the tune of R25 million. In other words, mining gets the least and the manufacturing industry by far the most.</p>
                        <p>I myself have always been under a totally wrong impression. I thought it was true that agriculture was getting the major share of the subsidies but that is not the position. Sir, you will once again realize that the public has a wrong image of the agricultural industry. It is our fault; I do not blame anybody for it. We have never yet put all the facts to the public. If we did so the public would view the industry in a different light.</p>
                        <p>I should like to apply another yardstick that we cannot ignore and that is the following: Money is important; to generate wealth is important, but I say wealth is a privilege; It is not a right. But labour, the opportunity to work, is a right and not a privilege. Let us see what agriculture does in that respect. If one takes that as a basis, agriculture together with forestry&#x2014;in this case I have included forestry but not in the other cases&#x2014;provides work for 2,5 million people as against 1,3 million by the manufacturing industry and approximately 0,75 million by mining. That is the position today, Sir. While being grateful for what has been done, let me say at once that we should not look to agriculture and to mining to provide more work opportunities for our growing population because they are already more or less fully developed industries; they no longer have the growth potential. We have to look to our manufacturing industry. But then, just because agriculture is already providing employment for the vast majority of people, we should not take it for granted. In saying that I am not suggesting that anybody does take agriculture for granted, except the public. I am afraid, Sir, that a large section of the consumer public takes agriculture for granted and that is not right. The agricultural industry is by far the biggest single employer of labour of all branches of industry in South Africa. Let us express that in terms of another yardstick, namely, what the Government budgets for per employee in respect of these three branches of industry. These are interesting figures, Sir. At the moment, as far as the manufacturing industry is concerned, the Government budgets for an amount of R565 per employee; in the case of mining the amount is R266 per employee and in the case of agriculture the amount is R95 per employee. This is not the industry, therefore, that is being carried to the large extent to which the public believes it to be. If one expresses these figures in terms of direct subsidies per employee, what then is the position of the various industries? These are interesting figures, Sir. The manufacturing industry receives an amount of R91 per employee in direct subsidy, mining R35 and agriculture R15. This is an important yardstick, Sir. I say wealth is important but our greatest future task is to provide employment. Let us keep what we have because those are important avenues of employment.</p>
                        <p>We have said that the contribution by agriculture to the GDP is low. That is so. One of the main reasons why it is low is not only because its employees are unskilled or semi-skilled but also because the industry is not profitable. Let me make some comparisons. Take the returns in the manufacturing industry expressed in terms of shareholder interest as published in the statement of the Department of Finance. According to that statement the return in the case of commerce was 21,5% for the year 1977-&#x2019;78; in the case of the manufacturing industry the figure was somewhat lower, namely 19,6%&#x2014;it was higher the previous year&#x2014;and in the case of agriculture the figure was 3,4%, expressed in terms of available figures. The price of land has been adjusted and if I take only 60% of the land value, as estimated by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, then the percentage yield is nothing more than 5,5%. I have spoken to various economists and they agree that 60% is a reasonable percentage; they cannot find fault with that.</p>
                        <p>That being the position, Sir, do you realize what the problem of agriculture is? The problem is that of itself its margin of profit even in good years&#x2014;and agriculture has had very good years in the recent past&#x2014;is inadequate, and is even more than inadequate to allow it to make provision for the bad years. The moment times are bad, the man who lives on the breadline will find himself in difficulty. He manages while things go well but, as soon as times get hard, he has to be assisted, otherwise he will go under.</p>
                        <p>There is one point that I wish to stress in this hon. House today and that is that the profitability of the agricultural industry is not adequate enough to be healthy. It is untenably low. What is its position? We know that the Government does not play a major role in commerce, industry and mining when it comes to price determinations. The price of those products is mostly determined by the principle of supply and demand. But in the case of the agricultural industry the Government, indirectly and sometimes directly, determines more than 60% of its prices, be they minimum and/or fixed prices. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs said recently that the Government had a 64% control in this case. The contribution made by the South African agricultural industry to keep the cost of living low, particularly in the &#x2019;seventies, was out of all proportion to its ability to make that contribution. It was unable to do so but it did so nevertheless. But now that there are signs of lowering clouds such as drought conditions and other difficulties, the industry is experiencing problems. In no other industrial sphere in South Africa does one find that uncontrollable problem. It is a problem over which the farmer has no control. Nobody has any control over it. I am now talking about climatic circumstances such as droughts and so forth. In South Africa one can be sure of two things, Sir, namely death and drought. The lastmentioned occurs periodically. As I see the position, Sir, we are faced with the position today that if the drought conditions that still prevail in certain parts of the country continue into the second half of this year&#x2014;and that is very possible&#x2014; the agricultural industry will be faced with the most serious crisis it has ever experienced. Over a period of four years the debts of the farming community have increased by over 50%. I have all the figures here. The outstanding debts have doubled, and that is not because they are bad farmers. From the very nature of things there are bad farmers as well; but their invidious position is due mainly to the fact that their margin of profit is too low. The margin of profit is insufficient to enable them to make provision for difficult years and to enable them to withstand those difficult years.</p>
                        <p>I should like to bring a certain matter very strongly to the attention of the hon. the Minister of Finance and that is the boycott by housewives&#x2014;something which I do not understand&#x2014;-of agricultural products the moment prices are increased. When the price of manufactured goods is increased, nothing is said about it. The housewives accept that and say it is unavoidable. That is so and it is quite right. But the moment the price of agricultural products is increased, what does one hear then? Whatever the farmer does is not right, and the image the general public has of the farmer is one of someone who rides around in a luxury motorcar. Some of them do ride around in luxury motor-cars but there are many more people riding around in luxury motor-cars who are not farmers. The public says the bread of the farmer is buttered on both sides; that the farmer is never satisfied and is continually asking the Government for assistance. The farmers do not deserve the false image the public has of them.</p>
                        <p>The more successful those boycotts are, Sir, the more destructive their effect will be on the ability of the agricultural sector to produce food in future. The public did not want dairy produce prices to be increased and eventually the farmers said that they could not make ends meet. They then left the industry and today there are shortages. Today that action has had a boomerang effect on the consumer.</p>
                        <p>I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to do everything he can, to use his influence because we need him today more than ever before, to help us in correcting this incorrect image of the agricultural industry. We must do some soul-searching of our own. I am the last person to suggest that there is no fault to find with the agricultural industry. I want to admit immediately that agricultural industry also has its faults. One weakness in particular is the lack of adequate financial planning. That is a weakness in our farming industry. What do we expect of a farmer? He is a mechanic, he is a manager, he is a salesman. Many demands are made upon him, more demands than I could mention. If heavy demands are made of someone, one must realize that it is very difficult for that person to meet all those demands. It is not an easy task today to make a success of a large farming unit. To do so one must be more than fairly efficient. I make bold to say that generally speaking we have an efficient farming community in South Africa. However, I want to encourage them to be even more efficient and in particular to concentrate on financial planning. But if one&#x2019;s profit margin is not high enough one can plan as much as one likes but one will still be in difficulties. That is the problem.</p>
                        <p>I want to conclude by asking our agricultural unions, the agricultural industry as a whole and every member of the public&#x2014; every one of us will at some time or other feel the effect if the things that are wrong are not put right&#x2014;to assist in converting the wrong image of the agricultural industry into an image which it deserves on merit. Secondly, the State should have another in-depth look at all the facets of this branch of industry in order to ascertain what has to be done so as to increase its profitability. The intention is not to promote the interests of one industry over and above those of another. I know what the value of the manufacturing industry is. These three legs, these three wealth-producing industrial sectors, namely, agriculture, mining and the manufacturing industry, are like the three legs of a table. One cannot chop one leg off and think the table will remain upright. They are very much interdependent and are linked together. We know and appreciate what the State has done for the agricultural industry. But no one will hold it against me when I say that I think we should look afresh at the priorities in the Government&#x2019;s year-to-year budgeting, with special attention to the agricultural industry. I thank the hon. the Minister of Finance for that. I wish him, as well as his staff, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, Dr. De Loor who is sitting over there and who is his right-hand man, together with Dr. De Kock and the Reserve Bank, everything of the best and strength to cope with the extremely difficult and responsible task that awaits them in the coming year.

                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want to start by congratulating the hon. Senator Dr. Visser on his speech here this afternoon. He did a favour and rendered a service to the whole farming community of South Africa this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>†The hon. Senator Dr. Visser started by dealing with the other sectors of the economy and I will come back to those in a minute. He said that all sectors were doing well except agriculture. This speech of his could almost have been prompted by the contribution of my leader, the hon. Senator Oelrich, a little earlier, who also paid tribute to the farmers of the country. For once I find myself in a debate where I am following two speakers, one from either side of the House, who are totally 
                            <i>ad idem.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>However, I think there are a few points which must also be pointed out regarding the agricultural industry in this country. In the first place I believe that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser was totally correct when he said that in order to keep prices low, the agricultural industry was asked to carry a load which it can no longer bear. I must say to the hon. the Minister in all sincerity that I am sorry that he is sitting alone here this afternoon and that there were no other hon. members of the Cabinet here to listen to these two contributions by the two hon. Senators Oelrich and Visser. I believe there was a lot of good, sound common sense in what they said and if lessons can be learnt from what they have said, the whole of the country and the whole economy of the country can benefit from it.</p>
                        <p>Let me say right away that this statement by the hon. Senator Dr. Visser comes right back to the marketing system, to the marketing and pricing policy that has been applied throughout the previous years. He does not say it in a spirit of criticism, and at this stage I do not want to apportion the blame because I am not quite sure where it should lie, whether it lies with Government policy, with the policy of marketing boards or wherever it might lie. But the hon. Senator Dr. Visser and myself are 
                            <i>ad idem</i> here, and I hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will carry this message to his colleagues in the Cabinet, and say &#x201C;There is something wrong, please put it right&#x201D;, because they are the only ones who are in a position to do so. We cannot do it Neither the hon. Senator Dr. Visser nor myself nor anyone else in this hon. House can do it.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I must remind the hon. Senator Dr. Visser and the hon. the Minister that in the past we have asked for assistance for farmers. The hon. the Minister will remember that during the budget debate the NRP repeatedly asked for efforts to reduce the production or input costs of the agricultural sector. One of the things that he can do because it is in his power&#x2014;-and here I speak to the hon. the Minister personally&#x2014;is to reduce the levies and the duties that apply to input costs of the farmers. He knows that we have asked for that before, and I do not want to belabour that point now. Before I am tempted to turn this into an agricultural debate, Sir, I think I must turn back to other sectors of the economy.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser quitely rightly said at the beginning of his speech that we must stimulate growth, that this is the biggest problem in this country. I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree with him in that regard. He said that industry is faring better, that company profits have increased and that this is what he gathers from reports. Let me say to you. Sir, that he is quite correct. If one sits in an ivory tower and depends upon the financial reports which pertain only to the larger companies in this country, then one can only come to the conclusion that industry is doing better because company profits are increasing. But let me say to him right now that I believe that applies only to the larger companies in this country. Because when one gets down into the market-place and moves among the smaller men, one finds a completely different picture, and particularly in the commercial sector. One finds a picture not quite of gloom but one of optimism tempered by reality. There is optimism on the one hand as a result of the emergence of an economy which today, there is no doubt about it, is stronger than it was a year ago.</p>

                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Thank you, Sir. As I was saying, this optimism is tempered by concern for the prevailing realities. And those prevailing realities include the following points which I believe are the ones to which the hon. the Minister will have to pay attention.</p>
                        <p>The first one is the delay in the implementation of the main budget concessions. I think one of my colleagues in the Other Place dubbed this a mark time budget or a delayed action budget That money that will be in the hands of the taxpayer after the tax concessions reach him from July, is needed in their hands now. In fact, they needed it immediately the budget was announced. There is a decline in retail turnovers, with the exception again of the large chain stores. Three or four of them could be named but I don&#x2019;t think they should be named here. They are the only ones that have shown slight increases in turnover. But generally retail turnovers have gone down since Easter.</p>
                        <p>There is still a large unutilized manufacturing capacity and tied to that is the lack of incentive to invest. I want to deal more fully with that in a moment, Sir. There is continuing high unemployment; the inflation rate, I am sure, even causes concern to the hon. the Minister, there is a declining real and disposable income among the people of South Africa; and, of course, the escalating fuel prices cause the biggest concern of all.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the points that I have made, Sir, it is agreed in the market-place that the main emphasis must continue to be on economic growth by encouraging consumer spending, and it is only in that sector that we see the opportunity of creating growth in the economy. And it is this encouragement that will lead to the utilization of spare capacity, that will encourage investment and will provide the needed employment.</p>
                        <p>We have the economic situation in this country at the moment where the State has plenty of money. The gold bonanza, the general sales tax, other fiscal measures introduced by the hon. the Minister have resulted in the State not being short of money. For that reason we had a budget in March which announced concessions, concessions which, mainly, are only going to be felt from now on. But, Sir, those concessions have already been eaten up. They have already been eaten up by the increase in the inflation rate. At the moment the inflation rate stands at 12,7%, and the estimate of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs when he announced this last increase in the price of fuel was that this would add another 1,9% to the inflation rate. We are therefore now expecting an inflation rate of approximately 15%. We are well into the fire zone. We are in the danger zone. And I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister has seen the warning signs and that the Government is going to take the necessary steps to save the country from getting deep into that fire. And when we look at that figure, we should also look at the increase in the cost of foodstuffs. This was referred to by my friend, the hon. Senator Oelrich. We find that the April figure in regard to increases in the cost of foodstuffs compared with that of a year ago was 15,7%, and that was before the increases in the prices of administered foods such as maize, oilseed and dairy products that have been announced and also before the latest increase in the price of fuel. With that in mind it looks as if we are this year heading for an increase in the price of foodstuffs in the region of 20%. And the question must be asked: How are our people, particularly those who have fixed incomes and those in the lower income groups, going to exist under these circumstances?</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>The pensioners are of course included.</p>
                        <p>Sir, as I have said, it is necessary to stimulate consumer demand. That can only be done if they have a real increase in take-home pay&#x2014;if they have a real increase in their disposable income. For that reason I want to ask the hon. the Minister this afternoon to make certain concessions. He has the power. He does not have to come back to Parliament to get permission and in those cases where he has to get parliamentary approval he still has time to do so.</p>
                        <p>I believe the first thing he must do is to abolish the 7&#x00BD;% surcharge on import duty. This is multiplied in the market-place, as he knows, and by the time the consumer gets the article the surcharge is considerably more than 7&#x00BD;%. He must also abolish the 
                            <i>ad valorem</i> excise duty on those goods to which it still applies. That is the old sales duty, and this is also multiplied. With the advent of the general sales tax I do not believe that this is necessary any longer. And I would remind you, Sir, that the Government is not short of money. This will help to reduce the cost of living burden but in addition to that it is going to place in the hands of businessmen additional funds that are necessary because of the increased cost of stocks and necessary if they are to expand and develop.
                        </p>
                        <p>Again I believe that the hon. the Minister should immediately repay all outstanding loan levies and also drop the current levy on personal tax. This will place more money in the hands of the buying public, it will help consumer spending and it will help businessmen as well.</p>
                        <p>It is true that the hon. the Minister and his colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, have repeatedly tried to encourage growth and stimulate the economy of the country. They have spoken confidently of the growth in the economy. I believe that there are sectors&#x2014;and the hon. Senator Dr. Visser agrees with me&#x2014;that need further stimulation. They need more than just words from the hon. the Minister and his colleagues. They need something concrete that they can show as their way of also helping to stimulate this confidence. The first timid steps in the growth of South Africa have been taken.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Of course they were timid because businessmen were anxious about this. They were not too certain that they would not burn their fingers. That is the reason why all our financial institutions today are sitting sated with money. They are begging people to borrow money and to develop because they are sitting with more money than they know what to do with. That is why I say those were timid steps that were taken. Those people are going to withdraw unless the State will now put its money where its mouth is. This it can do by having regard to the points I suggested just now.</p>
                        <p>When we come to the poorer people, the pensioners and those with fixed incomes, and we find that the cost of living has gone up to 15,7%, I must add my voice to that of the hon. Senator Oelrich and ask the hon. the Minister to use his gold profits to subsidize the cost of basic foodstuffs. I know that there are millions of rands, including a special amount of R20 million, budgeted for subsidies to assist the consumer.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>It is an increase on the R50 million we have already provided.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>We had R50 million plus R20 million last year and we have R50 million plus R20 million this year. We will not argue about it, it is the same as last year. There is no further amount for subsidies than there was last year. With regard to pensioners I believe the time has come for the hon. the Minister to use the money he has to give the pensioners something now. They have to live between now and 1 October when they are to get an increase in their pensions and I do not believe that the Minister can be justified in withholding that increase any longer. I must ask him to give that to them now.</p>
                        <p>The last request I have to make of the hon. Minister in this regard is to rebate duties on food products and essential items. There are duties on food products besides the general sales tax and I am sure that the hon. the Minister can rebate those. I want to give him one example which affects the poorest sections of our economy, and that is the example of paraffin. I spoke about paraffin here earlier this session. With the advent of the levy of 6c the price of paraffin increased from 12c to 18c a litre. Do you know, Sir, that today paraffin sells for 33c a litre? When we think that that paraffin is used by the poorest sections of the economy for light, for cooking and for heating, I believe that this is one instance in particular where the hon. the Minister can talk to his colleagues and see whether there is a chance of relieving this tremendous burden of the poorer sections of our economy.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister and the hon. Senator Oelrich dealt with the high price of fuel and I think the time has come when we have to get this matter into perspective in South Africa. I believe we have to find out why we are in this position and why we are paying these tremendous prices for fuel.</p>
                        <p>World consumption is at the moment approximately 57 million barrels of crude oil per day. There is a shortfall which amounts to approximately 2 million barrels a day&#x2014;in other words, a 5% shortage. Therefore, I do not believe that our problem in South Africa is caused by a world shortage of fuel. Other countries in the world also have that problem of the 5% shortage for which they are bargaining with other countries.</p>
                        <p>I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that if it was only that 5% we were bargaining for and if it was only that 5% that we had to buy on the spot market our situation would not be as serious as it is today. The United States, the largest consumer which consumes about 70% of the daily consumption, is 5% short. There they are fighting over supplies, but that is because they are the largest consumer and 5% means a large amount short to them. But the United States of America, when it buys oil outside, is paying between 18 and 20 dollars a barrel. Europe, which is the second largest consumer, is also facing economic problems because of the increases in the price of fuel to Europe. What are those increases? Since Iran went out of production the price of market crude which in December was $12,81 has increased to $18,47. Market crude can still be purchased for that price. This is an increase of 50%. This is a tremendous increase and that is why the economists of these other countries are affected. But what is the position regarding South Africa?</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>I am coming to the Ayatollah. The Republic was dependent upon Iran for most of its supplies of oil. I can only assume that the contracts we had with Iran up to December when they were terminated, would have been at 12 to 14 dollars a barrel which was the ruling price at that time. That oil is no longer available to us. But what oil is available to us? This is where the crunch comes. There is an embargo in our regard by all the Opec countries, and we have therefore been forced to buy most of our oil on what is called the spot market The spot market is a market which originates in Rotterdam. Oil is offered there at between 34 and 36 dollars a barrel. This is what is reported but nobody can get any official figure of precisely what purchasers pay on that spot market. We do not know what the Republic is paying either. All that we can assume because of these tremendous increases we have had is that we are having to buy on the spot market. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has conceded that point. [Interjections.] I have to accept his word because I have no evidence to the contrary.</p>

                        <p>I am going to tell the hon. Senator what the argument is. This means that South Africa is paying for its oil not an increase of 50% but of 300%. We are now paying 300% more for our oil than we paid in December. Again the question has to be asked: Why? Why are we compelled to pay those prices? Is it for economic reasons? Is it because we cannot pay our debts? Is it because we do not have any money? Is it because we produce gold? I believe the answer to all these questions is no. I believe the answer to the question is because this is the price that we are paying for apartheid. This is the price of apartheid. It is the next instalment [Interjections.] We are the polecat of the world, as my friend says. This price that we are paying is the price we have to pay for the policy of the Government which is absolute anathema to other countries in the world, just as it is to many of us who oppose the Government in this country. I think the people of South Africa must know and understand that we are paying these high prices because of apartheid. The embargo against South Africa is not for any other reason but the internal policies of the Government When I say that this is a further instalment in the price of apartheid I must remind the Senate of the way in which we have had to disguise our exports. We have had to send cans to other countries to be labelled there so that they could sell them somewhere else. I have to remind the Senate of the arms embargo which is costing us five or six times what we should be paying for the defence of this country. [Interjections.] I do not know what that noise is all about.</p>

                        <p>I do not believe, notwithstanding the noise made by the hon. Senator, that the Government can claim credit for the increase in the price of gold. It has played a part, there is no doubt about it. The international gold marketing organization has also played a part, but I do not believe they can claim all the credit for this.</p>
                        <p>Sums have been done regarding the increase in the price of gold to show that the increase in the price of gold is commensurate with the increase in the price of oil. One can just imagine the situation South Africa would have been in if we had not been subject to the pressures of political embargoes, if we had been able to buy our fuel at the rate at which other countries in the world are importing oil. During May the European countries imported oil&#x2014;depending on the grade&#x2014;at prices ranging from $17 to $21 a barrel, but on the admission of these hon. Senators &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>It is impossible to talk against that noise, Sir. Hon. Senators here have conceded that we are not getting fuel at that price, or not very much of it, if we are getting any. We are being compelled to pay the spot prices which could be anything up to $36 a barrel. If we had our gold bonanza and fuel at the price of $18 to $21 a barrel, imagine then, Sir, what the economic state of this country would have been. Imagine then, Sir, the finance, the funds that would have been available for development, the very growth which the hon. the Minister wants, the growth that the hon. Senator Visser wants, the growth that we all want. How much of that could have been stimulated with our gold profits if we were paying a realistic price for our fuel? [Interjections.] Think of the confidence this would have instilled in the minds of investors in this country, investors both within the country and from outside the country, to invest in this country.</p>
                        <p>I must end, Sir, and I want to say this, that what South Africa needs now is a new Government. [Interjections.] It needs a Government which will move away from apartheid, a government that will leave apartheid alone and that will ensure freedom and justice for all our people in this country. [Interjections.] Then we would not be facing the situation that we face now of hardship, tremendous hardship, among our people locally.</p>
                        <p>There is one last word I want to address to the hon. the Minister on this point. There is one price which is more sensitive than all others, and that is the price of public transport, bus fares. This latest increase in the price of fuel, this levy of 15 cents a litre which has been imposed, means to one major carrier, a bus company transporting people daily, an increase of R2,5 million in their fuel bill. That is R2,5 million increase in their running expenses. That can only result in an increase in bus fares. The question of bus fares in the past has been a point of conflagration, a flash-point around which we have had riots, we have had strikes, we have had troubles within the country. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if it is not possible in view of the gold profits we have, in some way to alleviate that situation&#x2014;and this is my last demand of him this afternoon&#x2014;where the bus-users of this country can get some sort of rebate. Whether the dieseline is coloured, or the petrol the bus companies use, whatever system might be preferred, I think a case can be made out for a rebate of this particular levy in the interests of happiness, of stability and of peace within the country.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, in the first place I want to address a word of congratulation to our former President, the hon. Senator Marais Viljoen, 
                            <i>in absentia</i>, who has today been chosen as candidate for the State President. If one is a candidate for the NP, one can say one is a candidate for South Africa. I should like to congratulate him most heartily. It seems as if the older it becomes and the closer it comes to its demise, the more the Senate accomplishes. This will be the first time in the history of the Republic of South Africa that we have chosen a State President from the members of the Senate. We should like to congratulate him most warmly. I do not want to go into the financial problems of the country, as previous speakers have done. I just want to say that as long as Senator Horwood, our present Minister of Finance, is at the head of affairs and manages things as he is doing at the moment, the country does not have much to worry about for the future as far as our financial affairs are concerned.

I do not know if I have already mentioned this here, but a few days ago when he opened the new Exchange in Johannesburg when all the rich and important people of Johannesburg were present, he so impressed them that they said that if only he would change his name they would make him Minister of Finance of Israel, so satisfied were they with what he had done regarding the finances of this country.

                        </from>
                        <p>I do not want to talk so much about party politics but about the political position of South Africa apart from its economic position. I should like to connect my remarks in that respect to a letter which I read yesterday in one of the newspapers. It is a letter from an American in the death cell in America. The letter reads&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">As a prisoner on death row in the State of Texas, who watches with interest all proceedings having to do with the death penalty, I am amazed at the attitude of my President towards the subject. He will interfere along with his buddy, Andrew Young, in the internal affairs of South Africa when they execute a Black terrorist, but stand mute when a person is executed in this country. I am ashamed of my country&#x2019;s policy towards South Africa and want the people of your country to know that our politicians in power do not speak for the majority of the people of this country. Andrew Young is nothing more than a Black racist, a communist agitator, who has advocated the destruction of White society in order to advance the cause of the Black race, no doubt hoping to be the next President. In case you wonder, I believe the death penalty to be justified in some cases, therefore this letter is not one seeking sympathy for my own predicament. I do want the people of South Africa to know that even a person whom society has condemned can still feel insulted and embarrassed by his country&#x2019;s two-faced policy towards their own, which goes much further than an interference in the execution of a Black terrorist.</block>
                        <p>This is a man who writes a message to the people of South Africa from the death cell in America. He complains about the double standards according to which we are judged by his country and the world today. The question is: What really is the aim of the international community, both of the communist and the Western countries? Is it their intention to destroy South Africa, to destroy the White man in South Africa and to destroy the role of the White man in Africa? Are they doing it in respect of oil or in respect of trade or in what respect? We are at the crossroads today as far as the future of South Africa is concerned and as far as the future of the White man in Africa is concerned.</p>
                        <p>Twenty years ago I was in Ghana where a revolution is now in progress. I was there in the time of Nkrumah. At the entrance to their parliament there was a large white map on which there were only five black spots which were the then independent countries, viz. Egypt, Abyssinia, Ghana and one or two others. The idea was that that white map would become black. That was 20 years ago. Mr. President, in the past 20 years, 15 of which I have been in this Senate, I have seen how one after the other countries have fallen to Black domination. Rhodesia already has a Black government and South West Africa has a Black majority government, even if it is a temporary government. Only South Africa has a White Government. The question is: Can we survive? Just as the past 20 years has decided the future of the whole of Africa so the next 20 years will decide whether there is a place anywhere in Africa for the White man, a place where he can remain, a place where he can govern himself and where he will fit into the greater context in which he finds himself on this Black continent. That is where the policy of the NP comes in, Sir.</p>
                        <p>One of the reasons the international world wants to destroy us is because of international money power. The idea behind it is a unitary state in the world with a unitary government. At the moment UN is trying to bring about that unitary government That is their eventual aim. The reason why they are so opposed to South Africa is because we are not in favour of a unitary state; we are in favour of a multinational State. We acknowledge the diversity of nations. The international community wants to eliminate the diversity of nations so that they can promote their trade and can act in a world that has only one government. Europe is getting one government and UN is the other government. Russia wants to dominate the whole world. As Whites we see our way clear to live here under certain conditions. The first condition on which we can live somewhere in Africa, viz. here in South Africa, is that we must have an area where the White man can maintain his technology and his knowledge, his sovereignty and independence and where he can have a platform from which he can co-operate with the other nations of Africa and Southern Africa. That is the crux of the policy of the NP and that is the only policy which can assure us of a future as Whites. It makes no difference what party we belong to. When the day comes they will not ask who is a member of the NRP or who is a PFP member or who is an independent. They will ask who is White.</p>
                        <p>If we have an area in Africa over which we have sovereignty and where we have developed our own infrastructure, this cannot succeed. That was tried in the other colonies in Africa and did not work. That is the only way we can survive. That in short is our policy, but there are certain conditions attached to this. We as a White community will only be able to maintain ourselves in this South African part of the continent on certain conditions. The most important condition is that we must prove that we are responsible for the welfare of the non-Whites, not to oppress them but to help them. We have already shown this. We have the facts.</p>
                        <p>Here is the book which Dr. Jan Marais published. In this he draws a comparison between ourselves and the rest of Africa. He shows here what we do for the non-Whites. We do more for the non-Whites than the United Party and the hon. Senator Webber did over the years. [Interjections.] It is here that we must bring home to the non-Whites inside the Republic through our new information service, that they cannot continue to live in prosperity and enjoy their homes, wages and health services without the help of the White man. Senator Webber who complains about apartheid, does not understand this. He understands the caricature of apartheid and he is a product of the caricature of apartheid. Apartheid is not oppression. The NP concept of apartheid is multi-national development. That is what we are creating. [Interjections.]</p>

                        <p>The Government is showing by the action it is taking that it is prepared to do this. Once we have brought the homelands to independence and we can co-operate with them, we can spread our wings to co-operate with the rest of the states of Southern Africa. This is no new policy, Sir. This was the policy of Dr. Verwoerd. I was at the NP congress in Pretoria in 1959 when Dr. Verwoerd made his first speech that evening as Prime Minister of South Africa. I went to hear his views and his view was that we should follow the pattern of the British Commonwealth of Nations. That Commonwealth consisted of different nations, each retaining its own sovereignty but acting together as a unit. It is that pattern of the British Commonwealth of Nations that we have in mind for Southern Africa. The foundation has been laid. We are now helping Mozambique with its railways. If Mozambique wants to attack us, they can attack us from Mozambique, but they will not do so because it will harm their economy. We built the capital of Malawi; we transport Zambia&#x2019;s copper. I predict that the time will come when Angola will approach us in connection with water supplies and the technological development of their country because the Cubans cannot develop their country. We do business with the Congo, whether they admit it or not. I know that we do a great deal of trade with the Congo. We have the framework of co-operation but it is people like the hon. Senator Webber who pollute the whole world with the caricature image of our policy which they put to the world instead of putting the practical realities.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I withdraw it unreservedly. I have full confidence in the NP and in the way it governs. I have served for 30 years in the NP and I have never been sorry or ashamed that I joined this party. When I see the mess the Opposition have made of their party then I say: Thank the Lord, that I joined the National Party! [Interjections.]</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, in my view these are the problems confronting us today and in respect of which we must put our heads together. The hon. friends opposite must make their contributions because this is a problem that concerns the survival of the White man on the African continent. And that problem will be overcome within the foreseeable future. I am confident that we will be able to deal with it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, the only thing I agreed with, was when the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat, said right at the beginning of his speech that he congratulated our hon. colleague in this House, the hon. Senator Viljoen, on his nomination as State President. In that regard I agree entirely with him and I want to add my congratulations. He is probably the only State President who has ever called me his colleague. I am therefore more than doubly delighted by his nomination.</p>

                        <p>That may be so but the hon. Senator has a pleasant approach to a ridiculous policy. The other point is that the policy that he still propounds in the Chamber this afternoon, is one which I thought the National Party had long since abandoned. [Interjections.] I think he was talking of 20-30 years ago. He was talking about the preservation of the White race on this part of the Continent of Africa.</p>

                        <p>He does not make many speeches in this Chamber, worse luck, because I enjoy his speeches. They are always good for a smile and a laugh. However, I think his attitude and his defence of Nationalist Party policy was not the same policy that the hon. Senator Carr was referring to or which the hon. Senator Koch was referring to a little earlier. They were for instance shouting at the hon. Senator Webber whether he was going to talk apartheid policy at the South Coast election. They were getting quite agitated about it. I understood that that party had abandoned the apartheid policy. The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Pik Botha, is not prepared to &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I hope the hon. Senator Carr will go to the South Coast. It probably is the main function which he fulfils in that party and I think it is time he was accompanied by the hon. Senator Koch. They can then explain their policy down at the South Coast. However, I am most intrigued to know just what is the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy because that coming from the hon. Senator Dr. Loock is certainly not the same as that coming from other hon. Senators on the other side. They seem to have abandoned it from day to day. Or perhaps the hon. Senator Dr. Loock will tell me which part of the Nationalist Party he supports.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>We have our problems and I certainly will not dodge the problems that we have. The greatest problem that we have in South Africa is that for 30 years that party has been indoctrinating an electorate to accept a certain code which is going to be very difficult to change. They are going to find it harder than anybody else to change. That in fact is what happened at Randfontein. This is the problem of Randfontein. For 30 years they say one thing and then they come along and try to tell the people something else and find that they will not swallow it at Randfontein or anywhere else for that matter.</p>
                        <p>When we deal with the labour legislation that is coming forth within the next few days, I am going to talk about this particular aspect at much greater length, because I believe that this is one of the harms done to South Africa by those hon. members on the other side of the House.</p>
                        <p>I now want to come back to the hon. the Minister of Finance and say that South Africa has had a bad year, probably the worst year it has had in 20 or 30 years. Unfortunately, what is bad for South Africa is also bad for the Government of South Africa and for the people of South Africa, because they govern the country. Therefore, the mistakes that they make the people of South Africa are having to pay for. Mr. President, I don&#x2019;t intend to talk finance with the hon. the Minister this afternoon because there are other things that I believe need discussing at this late stage of the session. We have had the Information scandal. [Interjections.] I know that the hon. Senators on the other side and the hon. the Minister in particular would like to see the end of this particular scandal, and I agree with them.</p>
                        <p>Quite frankly, it bores me stiff. I am tired of the Information scandal. But it cannot end because there is still so much that has not been cleared up. The slate has not been wiped clean. And if hon. Ministers complain because the Opposition or a person like myself raises this matter at this stage, they must blame their own ranks because who brought the Information scandal to life in the last few weeks? None other than Dr. Connie Mulder and the former State President. No sooner has this scandal died down when somebody on the Nationalist side brings something new to light and the whole controversy is started all over again. Hon. Senators need not shrug their shoulders. If they want to kill off or wipe out the Information scandal then they had better see that we hear everything that there is to know about it so that we can get on with more important matters.</p>

                        <p>I am going to deal with some of those things right now. Mr. President, I do not want to leave any doubt in hon. Senators&#x2019; minds. I want to say that I am totally and completely unimpressed by the latest report of the Erasmus Commission. I was unimpressed by the first report, also by the second report which I thought was a farce, together with Gen. Van den Bergh, and I am even less impressed with the report that we have just had tabled.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>I will tell the hon. Senator why. And I hope the hon. Senator Dr. Loock will now have the political courage to agree with some of the things I am going to say. The Erasmus Commission&#x2019;s latest report is noted probably for the things it did not say rather than the things it did. There is a great deal that it seems to have left completely in the air. The commissioners have now gone back to their various jobs but in my view at no time in South Africa&#x2019;s history has a commission&#x2019;s report been so incomplete, left so many questions unanswered as this particular report. And I would also venture to say that the Erasmus Commission&#x2019;s report said a lot of things that need not have been said. For instance, it said things about people&#x2019;s private lives that I believe had nothing to do with the matter under investigation. But I want in fact to tax the hon. Senators&#x2019; opposite own particular loyalties in this regard, because when one looks at the first report of the Erasmus Commission one finds that it exonerated the former Prime Minister, later the State President. It exonerated him from any blame and completely cleared his name and his integrity. The final report of the Erasmus Commission blames the former Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster. It lays the blame squarely at his door, and yet not one shred of new evidence was produced from the time when the first report was published, which exonerated him, to the time when the final report was published which blames him. Not one shred of evidence was produced to change that finding. I want to challenge the few friends that I might have on the other side and also those who are not so friendly disposed towards me. I want to challenge every hon. Senator sitting on the other side to show me what they have done to defend their former colleague in the Cabinet. In fact, I feel ashamed, Sir, of politics in South Africa today. In the last few months two people who had reached high office in this country, Dr. Connie Mulder and the former Prime Minister and State President, Mr. Vorster, have been given all the blame for the Information scandal. Mr. Vorster served this country well under difficult circumstances, and I say this although I have no love for Mr. Vorster or his policies. Indeed, I opposed them completely. But I admired the way in which he tried to do his job. However, I opposed him openly, Mr. President. These hon. Senators supported him openly, and sometimes they became very emotional about it, but not one of them has had the courage to get up and say what they think about the treatment meted out to Mr. Vorster in this last report of the Erasmus Commission. [Interjections.] I believe that the attitude of hon. Senators opposite probably gives politics in South Africa a nasty overtone, a nasty name, because they do not have the courage to get up and defend their former colleague, and a colleague, as I have said, who according to the first report was found to be completely innocent of any wrongdoing, and yet was found guilty in the third report although no new evidence had been produced. [Interjections.] That hon. Senator is an attorney and should know better than I do &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>What sort of comment is that from the hon. Senator opposite?</p>
                        <p>This is certainly one aspect that has disturbed me very deeply, and it brings me to the next point. It seems to me that all the reports of the Erasmus Commission have at no stage implied that the people concerned, these two gentlemen I have mentioned, had enriched or benefited themselves in any way. I don&#x2019;t think that anybody has made that suggestion at any stage. That does not come into it. But, Sir, they are paying the price for their wrongdoings or for allowing things to happen or for covering up things that did happen.</p>
                        <p>However, I want now to put this question to the hon. the Minister of Finance. I have not dealt with him in regard to this report and I do not intend to deal with his role as stated in these reports. But I want to ask him something a tittle different in regard to this report. Does the hon. the Minister of Finance accept joint Cabinet responsibility? The hon. the Minister knows exactly what I mean by that, and what is meant by that right through the world in democratic societies. In any other democracy in the world, what has happened here in South Africa would have brought about the resignation of the government.</p>
                        <p>It would have brought about the resignation of people completely innocent of any knowledge of wrongdoing in the Government as well. We had the most senior and probably the best western leader in the world resign as Chancellor of West Germany, Willie Brandt, because they found a spy on his staff. Willie Brandt had nothing to do with the spy on his staff, but he felt compelled to resign. Members of Cabinets in other countries have also resigned because they felt duty bound to resign under circumstances similar to these. But in this country they go on regardless of what has been said. Here the Prime Minister and a senior Cabinet Minister, if not the most senior Cabinet Minister, are forced out of office because of something that took place, but nobody else in the Cabinet takes responsibility or offers his resignation. I believe that is a bad mark against democracy and the democratic system in South Africa. I am not questioning the role of the hon. the Minister of Finance as set out in these reports, but I want to ask him as a member of the Cabinet at the time whether he believes in joint Cabinet responsibility. If he does not, where are we going in South Africa? What responsibility does the executive accept?</p>

                        <p>Mr. President there would be no argument if they agreed with me. What I am saying to the hon. the Minister of Finance, is that I believe he is duty bound to accept joint responsibility in this regard. I believe there is no other way of doing it in a democratic society.</p>
                        <p>I wish to express one final thought on the report of the Erasmus Commission. I do not expect the hon. the Minister to reply to it because he did not compile the report. Dr. Connie Mulder put this very well in 
                            <i>The Citizen.</i> Why was the purchase of 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> with State money condemned and yet the purchase of 
                            <i>To The Point</i> was not condemned? Dr. Mulder suggests that there can be no explanation for this. The two issues are identical. The newspaper was a daily financed by the Government out of public funds, while 
                            <i>To The Point</i> was a weekly supported by the Government out of public funds. That is the only difference between them. But the commission decided that 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> was improper, but that 
                            <i>To The Point</i> was perfectly in order. How can the ordinary man in the street then be expected to accept the commission&#x2019;s findings? They certainly do not make any sense.
                        </p>
                        <p>I believe that the Government has had a bad year for other reasons. Not many weeks ago people in South Africa and our friends outside South Africa &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>A few weeks ago people in South Africa and our friends outside South Africa were greatly encouraged by the publication of the reports of the Riekert en Wiehahn Commissions. A good many complimentary things were said about South Africa in regard to these two reports and a great deal of hope was engendered by them among South Africans and among our friends overseas. But what happened? After receiving these two reports, the Government hesitantly published a White Paper in which it seemed to accept most of the recommendations. But then suddenly there were conferences and differences of opinion with people like Paulus, and then we had the Randfontein by-election. The moment that happened, the Government ducked out of carrying out the recommendations as contained in these two reports because of its abject fear.</p>
                        <p>That is why I say again that the Government lacks the courage to carry out bold policies, and it is only bold policies which will get us out and keep us out of trouble. You see, Sir, when it comes to formulating a policy which conflicts with their race philosophy, then that policy becomes stone dead, and the hon. Senators on the other side must know it. I wonder how much power the hon. the Minister has as a senior member of the Cabinet to implement policy which is in contradiction to the Nationalist philosophy. I do not believe he would have any power at all. He might also find himself on the outside looking in if he tried to implement such a policy.</p>
                        <p>These two reports which gave so much encouragement to the average South African have become nothing more than a damp squib, a wet sponge, a slap in the face, because the Government has failed to tackle the problems facing us. More than this, though, Sir, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that South Africa also had a bad year, because democracy died more in this session which is now coming to an end, than in any other session since 1910. Democracy sustained severe wounds during the last few weeks of this session. More restrictions are being placed on the press. In the last days we have had &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>No, Mr. President, if you will forgive me, there have already been five Bills passed through this House which restricted the Press, and I am not including those still to come. I say that in this session we have again damaged democracy. We have had the statements by the Commissioner of Police as reported in the press yesterday warning policemen not to complain publicly to the Press about their poor conditions of pay. [Interjections.] The police have been told not to complain about their poor conditions. Who must they complain to? Who is going to listen to them? [Interjections.] The hon. Senator does not understand. I am saying this is democracy which is continually being undermined, and democracy suffered more in this session than it has suffered since 1910. If we go on like this, within a couple of years there will be no democracy in South Africa. We will have truly joined all the other African states, the banana republics which we are beginning to ape in almost everything we do and say.</p>
                        <p>This is why I am concerned about this session which is now coming to an end. I have sat in this Chamber and in the Other Place for a total of something like 14 sessions, and I have never known one where more controls, more restrictions have been slowly placed on the Statute Book. This is the sort of thing that is going on. [Interjections.] Hon. Senators opposite talk about the dangers to South Africa, the dangers implied in certain suggestions which have been made. But, Sir, there is no greater danger to South Africa than the attitude of the hon. Senators opposite. The hon. Senator Dr. Loock spoke of the White man&#x2019;s place on the Southern continent. The White man will have no place anywhere in Africa if the attitude of the NP is allowed to continue. They do not seem to have learned the lesson of South West Africa. Only this week South West Africa dealt with a Bill to scrap apartheid and race discrimination. South West Africa has been akin to us for so many years, and this week it took the bold step because it knew there was no other course. Our friends, our kith and kin in Rhodesia have done the same. If we do not start to look at our problems, we will not escape the Rhodesian situation or the South West African situation. [Interjections.] This is what we are trying to prevent in South Africa.</p>

We can condemn the outside world, we can condemn the United Nations&#x2014;I believe justly so&#x2014;but then we give them ammunition because we practise double standards all the time. Sir, if we want to preserve ourselves in South Africa we have to start looking at the role that we are playing. [Time expired.]</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I do not know whether the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat makes these outlandish statements just to attract the attention of the Press or the world outside. Some of the things he says are extremely irresponsible and they indicate an extreme lack of knowledge of the subject on which he professes to be speaking. I shall refer to only a few of them because I have not much time at my disposal. I want to say to that hon. Senator that his view of the international situation of South Africa is so narrow that we on this side of the House gain the impression that all he reads is the 
                            <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, instead of broadening his knowledge by reading 
                            <i>To The Point</i> as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>That hon. Senator made a comparison which I want to put right. He said that 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> and 
                            <i>To The Point</i> were identical as far as the Government&#x2019;s involvement was concerned. I want to say immediately that that hon. Senator is either terribly illinformed or quite unable to grasp what the difference is.

The Government has done everything in its power to put that in its right perspective. In the other instance, the Government recognized that in some way it had aided another magazine which was a nonpolitical party magazine and which was putting the case of South Africa&#x2014;which unfortunately sometimes includes that hon. Senator as well&#x2014;and defending this country against some of the most heinous lies that are told in the world about South Africa. The sooner that hon. Senator learns to appreciate that he is part of South Africa, that what we are doing in South Africa today is to defend ourselves against a very unfair situation in the world and that we need to defend ourselves, the sooner will he be happier in the political atmosphere in which he finds himself.

                        <p>I want to deal with a point made by the hon. Senator Webber. That hon. Senator started to speak about the prices that we have to pay in this country for oil. He spoke with a great deal of authority but I am afraid that his authoritative sources must have been sucked out of his thumb because what he said was utter rubbish. I have never heard such trash in my life, Sir. He said two things. Firstly, he said that we are paying 300% more than any other country for our oil and secondly, he said that the reason why we were paying more was because we practise apartheid.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>There is absolutely no truth in either of those two statements. [Interjections.] The factual situation is that the world is not 5% short of oil but only something like 3,9%. America has, in fact, done a great deal to secure her oil supplies amidst the shortage that exists in the world today. But because of her financial might and because of her economic pull, she has been able to do some things which have also been condemned by Western Europe. To try to isolate South Africa as if she were the scapegoat of some kind of world plot and to try to isolate us as if we were doing a government to government trade in the purchasing of oil, is to show the misinformation which that hon. Senator must carry around with him. We do not buy at government to government level. We have international companies operating within this country who secure the oil for this country through the normal channels through which they have secured that oil in the years gone by. Because of certain problems winch have arisen in Iran, they do experience difficulty in buying market crude.</p>
                        <p>If that hon. Senator knows anything about oil he will realize that marker crude is a certain kind of crude mix and that certain kind of crude mix sometimes becomes unavailable because it comes from a certain Arabian country and it is called by another name, namely &#x201C;Arabian light&#x201D;. For that reason, when we get a heavy crude into this country we do experience certain shortages within certain spectrums of what comes out of a barrel of oil. That is the truth of the matter, Sir.</p>
                        <p>It is quite true that when shortages arise people have recourse to the spot market. The fact that spot market prices are high is because the oil there is bid for by the world. And they do not say: &#x201C;Who is that bidding? We are going to make the price to you 40 dollars,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Who is that bidding? We are going to make the price to you 20 dollars.&#x201D; It is bid for on the open market. To suggest that South Africa has to pay a premium price because it is practising apartheid is a heinous lie and I refute it.</p>
                        <p>I want to ask that hon. Senator, if he has more information than I have on that subject whether he will please produce it because then at least he will be producing something in the interests of South Africa. [Interjections.]</p>
                        <p>I want to say a few things to the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat. He said the National Party was in fact identifying itself as if it were South Africa. To a very large extent that is the truth. We in the National Party do identify ourselves as South Africans. That hon. Senator and the members of his party because of their behaviour and because of what they say identify themselves very often as being people who are not South Africans in their outlook.</p>
                        <p>Under the worst possible political circumstances we fought an election in Randfontein. What position could have been worse for a party than the circumstances under which we had to go to Randfontein to fight the election? What could have been worse? After a scandal which included a lot of unsubstantiated remarks on the part of a lot of people, including those hon. Senators, we had to fight that election. Despite the fact that the report was released before the election took place, despite everything, that party whom that hon. Senator represents bit the dust, to put it lightly. Their candidate lost his deposit.</p>

He was a very successful publisher in Holland and that man decided eight years ago that South Africa was getting a raw deal in the world. He said to himself: &#x201C;I do not believe everything that I hear about South Africa.&#x201D; He obtained certain information via the wide publishing contacts he had in the world. This is a man who should not be underrated. He is a personal friend of possibly a future President of the United States. He has very influential contacts, and yet certain newspapers in this country have maligned him by insinuating that he is a bad person. And that is a bad characteristic of some newspapers. Without saying it outright, they insinuate that a man&#x2019;s character is in fact open to question. I have never met this person in the company of my brother. I have met him socially with others and I must admit that I was ashamed to see him and his wife leaving South Africa in tears. They came to South Africa with the intention of doing something for this country, and what happened? They left here feeling disgraced, like criminals, all because they believed in what South Africa was trying to do. In their eyes it was right.

                        <p>There is nothing in the Erasmus report about him. Do not show your ignorance any further.</p>
                        <p>For some time now I have wanted to put it on record that I was aggrieved as a South African to see the treatment meted out to these people by some newspapers. How many more people in the outside world who are friendily disposed towards our country and want to assist us will not be frightened away by such treatment? Those two hon. Senators who make so many Interjections when one attacks them because they feel so guilty, should ask themselves whether they are in fact serving a purpose in the political situation in South Africa. Are they in fact serving this country and contributing towards its welfare because at this moment in time we need people who can contribute towards the welfare of South Africa. We are South Africans and have no other place to go to. We want the best for everybody in this country.</p>
                        <p>Those hon. Senators try to create the impression that apartheid is some kind of oppressive measure. They make it out to be something that is intended to separate and keep nations apart, as if we were building fences between cattle. That, however, is a heinous lie because the Government has stated repeatedly what it is trying to do by means of apartheid. With the co-operation of all the national groups the Government is trying to bring about self-expression for these nations. It is trying to establish nations in South Africa without bloodshed. But when independence is achieved by a state in South Africa it is not recognized by the United Nations who then have something else to rant about. [Interjections.]</p>
                        <p>That hon. Senator should ask himself whether he is on the right track because his idea of apartheid is vastly different to that held by this side of the House. I do not know whether he ever listens to what is said by this side of the House or whether he ever reads a magazine or anything else that sets out intelligently the aims and objects of apartheid. If he did he certainly would not behave in this manner. [Interjections.]</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I was in a very privileged position because I was in fact the chairman of an investigating committee. Despite the fact that a few inducements were held out to me&#x2014;in other words, I was promised a certain job should I decide to join a certain party&#x2014;and despite the fact that on the Saturday I had to decide which party I should join on the following Monday, I still decided to join the NP. This should indicate to the hon. Senator that there must have been a very strong conviction on my part that dissuaded me from accepting the inducements and prompted me to join the NP. I did this because of my firm conviction that this is the only party which in fact can do the job that lies ahead for South Africa. Despite the fact that we have had to walk a rough road and have had to surmount a few obstacles, I am still convinced that the path ahead for South Africa will be safe in the hands of the National Party. I have absolutely no confidence in the direction in which the hon. Senator Winchester or the hon. Senator Webber is going. I am sorry that when they make a speech they cannot do so in the same moderate terms as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this House. When he speaks about the fuel problem or any other problem he does so with a certain amount of responsibility, but I am afraid that the two hon. Senators whom I have mentioned do not follow his example.</p>
                        <p>I want to mention one other thing to the hon. Leader of the Opposition because I think be referred in a responsible way to the rise in the price of fuel. Nobody in South Africa does not regret the rise in the price of fuel. Of course the price of fuel has gone up, but South Africa is only one of many countries where this has happened. First of all, therefore, let us be assured that we are not out of step with the rest of the world in that regard.</p>
                    </speech>
                    <speech by="#winchester">
                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>The price here is one of the highest in the world.</p>
                    </speech>
                    <speech by="#poorter">
                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Secondly, what are we using the money for that we are obtaining from the levy on the price of fuel? We are not using this money in an irresponsible way. We are using this money to swell a fund and to establish the means which will enable us to procure supplies of fuel in the future. There are also certain advantages in the escalating price of fuel, and I do not want anybody, especially the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, to underestimate the influence of an increase in the price of fuel.</p>
                        <p>There are two kinds of price predictions in the world. One has what we call a medium price prediction and a high price prediction. When one refers to a medium price prediction, one is referring to the amount of energy that one can get out of the ground, because it is covered by a type of price umbrella. If one gives it a higher price prediction, one has a greater recovery potential In the one case it is considered that if one has a medium price prediction, one can only get 75% of the energy out of the earth. If one has a high price prediction, one can get nearly 100% energy out of the earth. It is therefore understandable that when we increase the price of petrol in South Africa, we extend the possibility of developing energy from other sources over a very wide range in South Africa. If we want to survive the year 2020 it is absolutely essential that we should start planning now for our future energy requirements.</p>
                        <p>In the short time at my disposal I would like to give hon. Senators just a hint of the type of development we will have to undertake. I would like to relate the amount of solar energy that we will have to extract in the next 45 years to the amount of electricity we are using today. I want to say that the amount of electricity that we are using today will have to be derived from solar energy within the next 45 years in order to keep up with development. I say this because energy is as closely linked to the development of a country and its economy as a baby is linked to milk. It is absolutely essential that we relate the energy requirements of our country to those of our economic expansion.</p>
                        <p>It is no secret to anybody that economically we have to expand in a big way in the future, and that expansion will depend on the amount of energy we will be able to obtain from the earth. Fortunately for South Africa we have a great deal of energy potential under the earths crust, and I know that under the direction of this hon. Minister of Finance we will utilize it fully. I want to commend the hon. the Minister, Sir, because under difficult circumstances he has ensured that South Africa has come out on top. Even the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged that we have money in this country. The hon. Senator Webber also said that we have plenty of money. But we do not have plenty of money in this country by accident. We have it because of the thorough planning and through the conviction of a Minister of Finance who knows what he is doing, who sees his policies through, who, irrespective of the political consequences, says &#x201C;This is the best for this country&#x201D;&#x2014;not the best for the NP&#x2014;and in fact sees that this policy is carried out. And that hon. Senator can still drive a motor-car, can still be happy and sleep well at night because he has an hon. Minister of Finance who looks after his interests as well.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">A. BOZAS</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, before the debate was adjourned yesterday, the hon. Senator Dr. Loock had given us a long story and had said that he was the core of the Nationalist Party. When my car starts overheating I look at the cooling system. I usually find that the radiator is at fault and I recore it. I suggest it is time that the Nationalist Party had a recore. [Interjections.]</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Poorter dealt with certain matters and raised the question why the Press and the hon. Senator Winchester had likened 
                            <i>To The Point</i> to 
                            <i>The Citizen.</i> The hon. Senator Winchester said both were wrong and he wanted to know the reason why. It is quite clear that both these publications were handled by the company known as South Africa Today. They had common directors, etc. Let us be frank and admit that both of them were financed from secret funds, one to the tune of about R32 million and the other to the tune of about R14 million. As far as I am concerned they can therefore be put into the same category.
                        </p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Poorter also questioned the loyalty of members of the Opposition to South Africa. I want to say that many members on the Opposition benches showed their loyalty during 1939 to 1945, and I question where some of the members sitting opposite were at that stage. I do not think the hon. Senator should cast aspersions in this regard.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Poorter also questioned the statement made by my colleague, the hon. Senator Webber, that we were paying 300% more for oil. I think there was a misunderstanding on the part of the hon. Senator Poorter because what my colleague sought to convey was that the price of oil in South Africa to the motorist has gone up by approximately 300% and not that we were paying 300% more for our oil. What the hon. Senator Webber did say was that South Africa was having to pay approximately twice the OPEC price because we were having to buy on the spot market. [Interjections.] I will answer that, the hon. Senator must just be patient. He said that the reason why we were paying twice the OPEC price was because of apartheid. Let us analyse this statement. Because of its policies, South Africa has been made either the scapegoat or the polecat of the world&#x2014;call it what you will. We have been barred from the sportsfields and from all sorts of international consultative bodies and we are having to pay premium prices for our oil.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Of course I can prove it. To suggest otherwise is merely trying to evade the issue. Let us face facts. We are being castigated and boycotted by the Arab nations as far as the supply of oil is concerned, so there can be no question about it. [Interjections.] If the hon. Senator says &#x201C;Rubbish&#x201D; I suggest that he finds himself a bin and throws himself into it!</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator said: &#x201C;We in the National Party do identify ourselves as South Africans.&#x201D; I have said before and I say again that where hon. Senators opposite make a mistake is that they refer to the national interest when they mean the Nationalist interest. The sooner they change that, the better.</p>
                        <p>As far as Dr. Jussen is concerned, it is with regret that I have to say that it is because of his association with the company known as South Africa Today that he has been criticized and castigated by the Press and other people. I think he is a true friend of South Africa, but having become involved with secret funds and secret organizations, the odium has stuck and I am afraid it is going to take a long time for him to live it down.</p>
                        <p>I think it is quite clear that the problems in South Africa today revolve around two crises, viz. an energy crisis and a crisis of confidence. I will deal with these in the course of my speech.</p>
                        <p>I think that we must accept that we have an energy crisis. We all admit it and we have analysed the reasons for it. It is going to be difficult to overcome this oil shortage. After all, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has told us that we are having to pay more than 200% more than the OPEC price for our oil on the spot market. This fact has been denied by the hon. Senator Poorter. Be that as it may, I think the hon. Senator Poorter has made valuable contributions on a few occasions to debates of this nature in that he has pointed out the various reasons why one cannot get more than a certain amount of diesel out of a barrel of oil. He also indicated the need to convert to solar energy. I have pleaded with the hon. the Minister before and I plead with him again that in order to help overcome the energy crisis, low cost loans or some type of subsidy should be made available to enable big consumers of energy to convert to electricity or solar heating or both. This is an important aspect.</p>
                        <p>I also want to point out that in terms of Government policy non-Whites are housed very far from their places of employment. We find the Blacks living far out and generally speaking the Coloured people and the Indian people living far away from the industrial areas or the commercial areas in the towns which are their places of employment. That being the case, they have no option but to use public transport or they use their own transport, because they are usually too far away to walk to their place of employment and I therefore plead for sympathy to be shown by the Government in regard to the costs incurred by these people in getting to and from work.</p>
                        <p>The transport subsidies paid up to now are nowhere near adequate because the passenger bus services are already labouring under the increases announced just over a month ago, and since then we have had the increase of 15 cents per litre&#x2014;post Randfontein. There is this problem, Sir, and I would like to appeal once again to the hon. the Minister to see what he can do about an increase in the transport subsidy.</p>
                        <p>I also want to deal very briefly with the question of the plight of the farmers. Earlier this session I referred to the difficulties facing the farmers. These difficulties have been compounded by the terrific increases in the price of fuel that have hit the country over the past few months. Our costs of production have increased alarmingly and I want to pay tribute to the hon. Senator Oelrich, the hon. Senator Dr. Visser and the hon. Senator Webber who underlined the problems of the farming community.</p>
                        <p>I must appeal to the hon. the Minister to take a realistic view of this and go to his Cabinet colleagues and tell them that the time when they expected to be able to keep the farmer a pauper is past. We have now got to pay the farmer a realistic price for his produce &#x2026;</p>

The days of cheap food, I am afraid, are over, because so many of the inputs of the farming community are heavily taxed. I want to ask hon. Senators to go out and tell the people that there is no such thing as a subsidy for a farmer. The Government is not subsidizing the farmer, Sir, not by any means; they are subsidizing the consumer in an indirect way.</p>
                        <p>I say let us rather pay the farmer the price for his produce and subsidize the consumer. Let us not call them farming subsidies because they are not farmers&#x2019; subsidies by any manner or means.</p>

                        <p>They are food subsidies to the consumer. The farming community are the backbone of this country. If they are taken away we will collapse, because if we cannot feed the people we can never develop economically or commercially or in any other way.</p>
                        <p>Having said that, Sir, I would say that the one problem facing us is that of inflation. It is running away again, partly through no fault of our own, but, Sir, the one way to fight inflation is to increase productivity. That does not necessarily mean we must work harder but it means we must work more objectively; we must work with our brains and not with our brawn. I think that the concessions that have been made in the budget in respect of reductions in income tax should go a long way towards encouraging people to work harder. But it is necessary for us to impress on the people that the country as a whole must help in the fight against inflation. If they all come forward and we have better productivity, then we will be able to lay the inflation ghost which has hindered us for so many years.</p>
                        <p>But here the industrialist, the entrepreneur, is still concerned about the long-term aspects. His confidence in the short-term has been revived but he is still rather concerned from the long-term view because he does not know to what extent we are prepared to accept in full the recommendations of the Riekert and Wiehahn Commissions. We have before us amendments to the Industrial Conciliation Act but as far as entrepreneurs are concerned they do not go far enough. The legislation before us certainly does not go as far as the White Paper led us to believe it would go. There is this crisis of confidence among the industrial community as to whether we are going to go far enough or whether we are going to let the right wing of the NP rule the country and so forestall any attempt at progress in the future.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I think you will agree with me that in the course of the debate which has taken up no more than a single day of the Senate&#x2019;s time, we have had a number of not only interesting but important contributions from both sides of the House. I think some very valuable suggestions and arguments have been put forward. The hon. Senators Oelrich, Webber and Bozas of the Official Opposition, and the hon. Senator Winchester, and on this side of the House the hon. Senators Dr. Visser, Dr. Loock and Comdt. Poorter&#x2014;I hope I have not left anybody out&#x2014;have all made contributions which stamp this debate, in my humble opinion, as a valuable one in this House. It is very pleasant to see this, particularly when everyone is under some pressure of work towards the end of a longish session, and I think the Senate has done very well.</p>
                        <p>I want to refer to some aspects of the debate. Obviously I cannot refer to all. If I do not get round to dealing with all the hon. Senators who have advanced arguments and aired points of view which really deserve comment, I trust they will forgive me.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Bozas&#x2014;to start with the last speaker&#x2014;is more convincing when he talks on economics and finance than when he talks on party politics, if I may say so in the nicest way. He referred to the statement by the hon. Senator Webber to the effect that South Africa is paying these unduly high prices for oil today because of the policy of apartheid. Now, Sir, let us be quite clear. It is not because of the policy of apartheid or separate development, as I much prefer to call it, that this position has arisen. It is no doubt perhaps to some extent due to the fact that this side of the House and the Government have refused to hand over our birth-right to the Marxists and the terrorists.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I do not want to get into any political arguments but I put that with respect to the hon. Senator Bozas. Perhaps on another occasion, if there is such an occasion, he might like to come back to that particular point that he raised in his speech. But I leave it at. that The fact of the matter is that we are having to pay very high prices for oil. It is true that the whole world is paying substantially more for oil. Not all countries are paying the same price, obviously, but I doubt if there is any country worth mentioning today that is not being very detrimentally affected by this very serious problem, namely the so-called hike in liquid fuel prices. It is an extremely serious matter. As I tried to say in my speech yesterday, I believe that we have at least tried to put ourselves in the position of having a basically strong economy to withstand these slings and arrows of outrageous fortune because of our basic financial strength. Let us make it perfectly clear, the Government cannot take all the credit for that position. We have had a very substantial increase in the price of gold and that is something which has also benefited us substantially.</p>
                        <p>*Mr. President, a feature of this debate, and quite rightly so, has been the emphasis on our farming industry, agriculture, and the problems which without doubt they have encountered recently.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Oelrich made a positive contribution in this regard. I agree with him. Broadly speaking his approach is quite right.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser in my view made a very convincing speech, mostly in connection with problems in the sphere of agriculture.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Webber also referred to this, as did other hon. Senators. I think right at the end the hon. Senator Bozas also referred to it briefly.</p>
                        <p>If I understood the hon. Senator Oelrich correctly, he made the statement, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, that we must seriously consider paying food subsidies out of gold profits&#x2014;to make subsidies on fuel or petrol available for the food industry.

                        <p>Good. I accept that. He also pleaded in general that there should be no decrease in subsidies as a whole. I say again categorically that I have great sympathy with the farming industry at the present moment because there are pressing problems.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Decidedly not. I think if one considers and analyses the recent budget and the steps which are now under consideration&#x2014;-and not only in the latest budget but in fact the last few budgets&#x2014;one sees very clearly that this Government adopts a very definite attitude towards the farming community. Once again I want to stress that my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, and I set up a working committee earlier this year. In my view it is a very effective committee although it has not been active very long. The committee is under the chairmanship of Dr. Jacobs, the General Manager of the Reserve Bank, and is a very representative body consisting of representatives of the agricultural industry, the co-operatives, the Land Bank itself, the Reserve Bank, Finance, Treasury and so on. That committee has already given us a report and we took immediate steps in the light of that first report to provide a measure of relief. The Jacobs Committee is now engaged in a more penetrating and important inquiry. This is in connection with the long-term problems of the farming industry. We expect that report in the near future and we shall give preference to it. We shall also definitely try to take further steps to help the agricultural industry in the present circumstances. I mention this again. I think I have also said this on a previous occasion in this House.</p>
                        <p>When we talk of subsidies, we must basically and in principle be very careful. Subsidies can be justified, of course, under certain circumstances and at the moment there are subsidies which I have absolutely no intention of terminating. But I do think we must be careful in general because it is a fact that subsidies do tend to distort real costs in the economy as a whole. As we say in English, subsidies can be so disruptive of the market or price system. I should therefore just like to issue this general warning, Mr. President. We must remember that subsidies are not the ideal solution to economic problems but, where grave problems do arise, especially in sectors which have themselves not been the cause of the problems, one has sometimes to resort to extraordinary measures. I should like to point out again that we raised the bread subsidy in the budget from R50 million to R70 million. In my view this is proof of the serious view the Government takes of the situation.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Oelrich spoke of the possibility of subsidies on fuel as an alternative. In this respect I should like to warn again that we must be careful. How wise is it to introduce subsidies of this sort? Subsidies on fuel are very difficult to administer, as has also been found in other countries. Once again it is subsidies which will distort the real cost of food. That is one of the problems which it will create and, of course, the rich as well as the poor will benefit.</p>
                        <p>The additional gold mining revenue as a result of the higher gold price has at this stage largely been earmarked to meet unavoidable increases in expenditure. Certain important increases only became effective after the budget, in the short period from 31 March. One thinks of Sasol and again of the oil problem, which means that we have had to take a lot more money out of the Treasury than we planned for two months ago.</p>
                        <p>I am merely mentioning these aspects, but it makes no difference to my general approach that there are definitely problems in the agricultural sector.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>I realize it full well, Sir, because I come up against it daily and also through representations addressed to me. In co-operation with the Jacobs Committee we are trying to find really effective methods to bring about&#x2014;I shall not necessarily call them solutions but hopefully they will be solutions&#x2014;significant relief in important spheres of the agricultural industry.</p>
                        <p>While the hon. Senator Dr. Visser was talking about agriculture he referred to the Priorities Committee. I think he pleaded for representation of the agricultural departments on the Priorities Committee. I have nothing against that. The Priorities Committee is a fairly small technical committee on which very senior officials serve under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Finance, as I said yesterday. Provision has also been made for that committee to co-opt members. As a result of the speech of the hon. Senator Dr. Visser this committee will probably reconsider the matter, and as far as I am concerned there is no problem as far as representation of the agricultural industry on that committee is concerned.</p>
                        <p>†The hon. Senator Webber made various suggestions to me in regard to concessions. He talked about the possibility of abolishing the rest of the surcharge on imports which is now 7&#x00BD;%. You may remember, Mr. President, that it was originally 15%, and was imposed as a revenue measure. We have up to now managed to have it in two phases. That is something we constantly bear in mind and I can assure the House, as I have said before, that if the state of our public finances is such that we can do without it, it is something I would personally rather welcome because it is not the sort of measure one particularly wants to see. But it certainly was important to find that revenue at the time.</p>
                        <p>He also pleaded for the abolition of the excise duties which have taken the place of the remaining old sales duties. Again it is, of course, a question of the needs of the fiscus where we have to meet all sorts of heavy requirements. The House knows that apart from the very substantial escalation in the cost of defence and security, there is also the need to step up the consolidation of the homelands programme. In addition, there is the very heavy commitment as a result of the big extensions to Sasol II, where we have to find R3 300 million in a matter of two or three years. There is, of course, the further problem posed by the latest very big oil price increase. All these things are extremely costly to the country and one has to bear that in mind. But by and large there is no doubt that we would like to see some of these concessions being made. I think we have made very substantial concessions this year in the budget. If we can go further under rather difficult conditions we certainly will not hesitate to do so. The hon. Senator Oelrich correctly said that if the price of gold continues as it is we ought certainly to increase the income from gold mining taxation, but I would ask the House to bear in mind that at the same time costs for the gold mining industry as for other industries are rising significantly, which affects the profitability and tax productivity of the mines. It is also true that some of these mines are looking for ways and means of developing and, as the House knows, they can write off substantial capital development costs against revenue. We must bear that in mind, because that would reduce what would otherwise be higher profits. These are some of the things we have to bear in mind when we look at this particular issue.</p>
                        <p>*I shall not keep the House long, but I should like to refer again to agriculture. I think that the hon. Senators Oelrich and Dr. Visser spoke very persuasively in this regard. They made certain statements and used arguments which were very interesting. I have absolutely no intention of criticizing their approach but I should like to comment on certain of the statements that have been made. This applies particularly in the case of the hon. Senator Dr. Visser because we must try to put things in perspective so that we can deal with them in a positive and constructive way and really help the farming community. I must repeat that broadly speaking we all agree that our farmers are experiencing problems. Any form of assistance which is given, especially systematic and planned assistance, must be provided against the background of the Jacobs Committee&#x2019;s report which we expect to have shortly. I am pleased that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser is here again. He may not have heard me say that I was particularly impressed with his speech. I agree with him completely when he pleaded for effective assistance for our farming community; not so much assistance but that our policy should be such that we can derive the greatest benefit from this very important sector for the whole country and population. I should, however, like to put the matter in perspective and come to certain conclusions.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser included the State&#x2019;s capital expenditure in respect of State corporations as aid to the industrial sector. Although this does indirectly assist the industrial sector, it is perhaps not quite correct to assess the position in that way. In the same way one would then have to include expenditure on dams, for instance, which are to the advantage of agriculture and are owned by the State, in agricultural expenditure. It is just a question of what they call comparing comparables.</p>
                        <p>Agriculture without doubt is the greatest work provider, as the hon. Senator Dr. Visser quite rightly pointed out. But I do feel it should also be pointed out that in the main it is the less skilled labour in the country that is so employed.</p>

                        <p>Yes, I agree that in itself it is important, but I just want to point out that seen in that light labour utilization and productivity per labourer in the agricultural industry is probably lower than in the industrial sphere as a whole where more skilled or highly skilled labour is used. If one looks at it from that angle, one can perhaps say that the industrial sector makes a larger contribution per labourer than does agriculture. If one wants to take it further, one could possibly say that in that connection the industrial sector makes a larger contribution to the living standard of the Black man. I should not like to take this matter too far, however, because one speaks of skilled and unskilled labour and there can be circumstances in which the unskilled labour may be more productive than the skilled. What I really do want to say is that with totally different types of workers it is not really fair to express the State&#x2019;s contribution per worker as the hon. Senator has done. But I do repeat that it is a good thing the hon. Senator did so because it resulted in our taking a very close look at these things and making a very thorough analysis.</p>

                        <p>As far as the current figures are concerned, I shall accept them, but as far as dams are concerned, there is, of course, the question of the purpose for which the dams are used.

                        <p>As far as the low profitability of the farming industry is concerned, this is true in many branches of the industry. But I think the problem is more involved than that. A rise in prices which will give a higher return to the farmer causes a rise in land prices immediately. Because the return in the case of the farming industry is determined by market-related agricultural land prices, the return will automatically decline again, even with an increased price.</p>
                        <p>I think hon. Senators will agree with me on that. It is generally conceded today, I think, that the value of agricultural land has not kept pace with its productive value, and this of course complicates the estimate of a rate of return. I think that is a major problem as far as agriculture is concerned, viz. to estimate precisely what the actual rate of return is. That is one of the reasons.</p>
                        <p>Further, Sir, it is in fact true that the prices of the majority of agricultural products are indirectly controlled. This matter was raised during the debate. In my view price control was not introduced to prejudice the farmer but rather for his benefit. I think in any case that was the main motive. Price control gives the farmer greater price stability. If there were no price control and a control board system, the farmer&#x2019;s income would be subject to great fluctuations.</p>

                        <p>Yes, that is so. I am sure that if we made a survey among farmers today they would vote for the retention of the existing control board system. I am speaking in general here. I just want to say that it is interesting to note that the real net farming income per farming unit from 1972 to 1978 rose by an average annual rate of 3,8%. The real income per capita for the whole population rose by approximately 1%, but the real income per White worker actually declined somewhat in that period. I think the figure is in the region of ,5%, and one could say that it has remained more or less constant. I want to repeat that I concede that adjustments will have to be made in agriculture but they must not be disruptive. They should rather enable the farmer to make a living as an entrepreneur in a free market in a capitalist country. I want to repeat: The solution, as far as I can see, does not lie in large-scale subsidies to the farmer. In this way the cost of production is disturbed and the costs are not brought home where they belong. A price adjustment of products with an accompanying food subsidy to the consumer would be more justified. I think this is where we are all in complete agreement. This method is recommended, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, by the World Bank and has been repeated in one of its latest publications.
                        </p>
                        <p>I should like to say once again that I have the greatest appreciation for the manner in which this very important aspect of our economy has been raised and dealt with in this debate. I do not want the hon. Senator Dr. Visser to feel that I am critical of his approach. That is definitely not the case. I agree with him. I am merely trying to analyse the arguments and get a balance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, when we have had the opportunity to put the studies now being made available to us to an authoritative committee whose recommendations we shall consider immediately and do the best we can, I trust that this hon. Senate will feel that the Government has once more shown how much in earnest it is in the steps it takes to stress the importance of the agricultural industry in South Africa. This is absolutely important because fundamentally, a country which cannot produce its own food today is at a great disadvantage. To put it the other way: The country that can produce its own food today has a very great advantage which it must utilize. I feel that South Africa is almost under an obligation to help its neighbouring states in Africa in the provision of food because it seems to me that they are unable to produce food on a scale sufficient to meet their own needs. I think South Africa will also derive great benefit from this for its own producers.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased that the debate has dealt mostly with the question of agriculture. I might just say that I myself grew up on a farm. It was not a mealie farm or a cattle farm, and so I did not have to contend with the hon. Senator Du Toit and his red meat problems. We had a wine farm.</p>

                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>Sir, the basic purpose of the Bill is to consolidate and supersede the Black Education Act, 1953, and the Black Special Education Act, 1964, and at the same time to bring the legislation into line with corresponding legislation of other departments of education. Consequently the basic objects of the superseding legislation amount to an attempt to establish the framework within which the department may meaningfully plan and extend the overall development of education for Blacks in order to meet the overall training requirements.</p>
                        <p>An aspect which also deserves mention is that there is and will be continuous liaison with other departments of education to ensure that the standards, on the lower levels, will be the same as is at the moment. The case on the Senior Certificate level at which the examination standards of the JMC or the Department of National Education are complied with.</p>
                        <p>I should like to make a few observations, Mr. President, on the Black Education Act and advance the reasons why it is deemed necessary and why I am pleased that it has now become possible for it to be superseded.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the Act was basically intended to make provision for the transfer of Black education from the provinces to the central Government. This process has been completed and the Act has consequently become redundant.</p>
                        <p>In the second place the education which was taken over from the provinces at the time, i.e. circa 1953 was for the most part subsidized or State-aided education. Only the teachers&#x2019; training schools, the trade and technical schools and certain senior secondary schools functioned as Government schools. However, other education remained State-aided. In reality the department did have control over the standard of education and professional control over the tuition, but was dependent on other bodies when it came to the establishment and provision of the necessary facilities. I am afraid that because of that system backlogs have been built up, backlogs which we have been fortunate enough to identify. We have also made provision to catch up on these backlogs.</p>
                        <p>In the third place the development of the Black states has been accelerated with the result that control over education, mainly community school education, has been transferred to the governments of those States and there has been a gradual shift in the emphasis in the educational system which has remained in what is known as the White area. There are continual discussions with the departments in those particular areas without encroaching on the autonomy of those countries but with a view to greater co-ordination. In this connection I can tell hon. Senators that I myself have had discussions with the chief ministers and the ministers of education, together with senior officials of my departments and I trust that we shall continue to have such discussions regularly.</p>
                        <p>If there is any misunderstanding in regard to the 1953 Act dealing with Black education, I should like to remove it. I think a misunderstanding arose because it was thought that that legislation placed a ceiling on the development of the Black child which was, in fact, not the case. With the limited means at our disposal in those days it was necessary, as was stated then, to benefit the greatest number of children with the available funds. This amounted to the fact that a very large number of students left school at a very low level to the detriment not only of the child itself and its future but to the detriment of our country as a whole. I do want to say, however, Sir, that no stumbling-block was placed in the way of those children who wanted to study further and in this respect we have had regular discussions with the leaders of the Black education departments. Hon. Senators will know about the African Teachers&#x2019; Association of South Africa, ATASA, with whom we have discussed these problems regularly and whom we also consulted in connection with this particular legislation.</p>
                        <p>Sir, I just want to say a few words about the formulation of policy in general. In the first place, in accordance with certain provision of the National Education Policy Act of 1967 certain principles are laid down within which policy has to be formulated. I want to refer to the first one, namely clause 3(a) which provides for the Christian character of schools. This is in conformity with the relevant clauses in the Act to which I have just referred. In the second place provision is made for the observance of the accepted educationally sound principle which is accepted by the Organization of African Unity, by Unesco, other bodies and by individual States, namely, the necessity for mother-tongue education at the lower levels at least. Hon. Senators will notice that the Bill contains certain proviso&#x2019;s which stipulate prior consultation with the parents as a prerequisite.</p>
                        <p>A third principle is compulsory school attendance and free tuition. This has been laid down as a principle for ultimate attainment. At a later stage I shall say a few words in this connection.</p>
                        <p>I also want to say a few words in connection with the Council for Education and Training. That is the body we envisage which will be composed of Black people, leaders in the educational field, people who naturally will be best able to determine what the needs are of the children of the various national groups. It is anticipated that this council will form an important link at all times between the community, the educational staff and the department. Seven subcommittees of the council are to be appointed and that will mean that the Black people will have a say across a very wide front in the formation of the education policy in general.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I think it is necessary for me to say a few words in connection with community schools. I do not know whether everybody is aware of the fact that inherent in the term &#x201C;community schools&#x201D; is the concept that in the past the Black people themselves built their own schools and that those schools were more or less financed by themselves in that provision was made in a housing scheme for the erection of school buildings and that a certain portion of the rental paid by the parents was used to cover such building costs. Provision is made in this new Bill for the department to make funds available and consequently there can be general planning as regards the need for a wide range of amenities which I trust we shall soon be able to provide&#x2014;some have already been provided&#x2014; and make available to an even greater extent. Furthermore, in the past the parents used to pay an education levy and that levy was used mostly for repairing and renovating schools and buildings etc. The idea is that the parents will continue to pay this levy but I am pleased to say that it has been agreed that in future this education levy will be used in consultation with school committees and other bodies of the various schools in order to provide essential sporting facilities which, I think we all agree, are necessary for the total development of the child in his youth.</p>
                        <p>I think I should say a word or two about the Teachers&#x2019; Council, namely the ATASA to which I have already referred and which has on occasion expressed itself in favour of such an Educational Council but expressed a different view at a later stage. With due regard for their attitude which they maintained throughout the discussions and with due regard for the opinion of those people who were not in complete agreement, this Bill was published for comment. Provision is now made in clause 31, pursuant to those representations, that the Minister may appoint such a council. In other words, this is an enabling clause and not a mandatory clause. When the required number of people ask for it, the provision for its establishment will at least be there.</p>
                        <p>A word or two about compulsory school attendance. In this connection I want to make a few brief observations. Compulsory school attendance places an obligation on both parents and children. I may say that we have not yet reached the stage and that we shall most probably not reach it soon when we shall be able to make school attendance compulsory throughout the country. The reasons are obvious. In the first place, the necessary facilities are lacking and in the second place we do not have the teachers with the necessary training, especially at secondary school level. We hope to overcome this within the foreseeable future. Then we have the position also that there are thousands and thousands of school children, on the platteland of South Africa in particular, who have not even had the privilege of enjoying primary school training at the lowest primary level. In this connection, after discussions with the official representatives of the Department of Agriculture on the South African Agricultural</p>
                        <p>Union and the Transvaal Agricultural Union, we come to an agreement and accepted their suggestion that to an increasing extent not only primary education be offered but that provision also be made for secondary education for Black children who come from the farms. That will enable the parents to send their children to school from their homes. That will take place after proper consultation, very circumspectly and in co-operation with the farmers themselves. The idea is also&#x2014;and in this connection regulations will be promulgated at a later stage&#x2014; that the farmers, the farming community&#x2014;I want to pay tribute to them for the important role they have played in the past, often without acknowledgment, in providing educational facilities for Black children&#x2014;will be compensated in a more realistic manner, even if it is to be by way of subsidies or the hiring of buildings etc. so that they can assist in educating the children of their farm workers.</p>
                        <p>Provision is also being made in the Act for the establishment of nursery schools. It is not necessary for me at this stage to refer to the absolute necessity for these schools, especially in view of the countless number of Black mothers who work. This legislation provides for the establishment of nursery schools as well and I trust that we shall soon be able to start with them.</p>
                        <p>As far as school health services are concerned, I should like to express my gratitude to the Department of Health for already having started to provide these services. Provision is made in this legislation that the health services to be provided for Black children are to be similar to those provided for White children. I have no doubt that because of the dedication of the officials of the Department of Health and those of my own department this service will develop into something worthwhile and will be to the benefit of the children of our Black people.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I just want to say that if this Bill is passed, the education of Blacks, as far as legislation is concerned&#x2014;and I emphasize this&#x2014;will be on a par with that provided by other education departments. From the nature of things an Act can make provision for something but an Act does not provide the wherewithal to make it possible. It will only be possible, therefore, to provide this through the goodwill of the people of South Africa. In this regard I include the goodwill of the Black people who should remember that it takes one match to set fire to a classroom but that that means that 40 children will be deprived of their education. It requires a large number of bricks to build one classroom and a lot of timber to put up one roof. A great deal of building work will have to be done in order to provide this necessary service for South Africa. This legislation makes it possible and I believe that this legislation heralds a new era which will be to the benefit of the Black children. And whatever is to the benefit of the Black children and the Black people is also to the benefit of the Whites and the future of South Africa.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, after listening to the hon. the Minister delivering his introductory speech and ending up with such a note of hope and emotional fervour, really reminds me of how a father rejoices at the return of a prodigal son. To compare the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude with debates we have had in the past is almost to compare day with night. I can name just one point in particular. The hon. the Minister mentioned how many children had been educated over recent years to a very low standard of education, how few had emerged at a higher level and how this factor had adversely affected not only the Black people but the economy of South Africa as a whole. I raised that issue pertinently on many occasions with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor and I was ridiculed, not only by the hon. the Minister but by those very hon. gentlemen sitting on the opposite benches. I was ridiculed and told I knew nothing about it. I do not want to over-emphasize this aspect. We on this side of the House are only too delighted that at last the Government in the person of the hon. the Minister of Education and Training have seen the light and are now doing something about it.</p>
                        <p>In previous debates with this hon. the Minister where he has expressed worthy sentiments, I have also pointed out to him that expressed sentiments in themselves were of little value and that action was in fact what was necessary. This Bill at last appears to correct a wrong direction which was taken 26 years ago which has caused years of frustration, recent social upheaval and violence for which South Africa has paid a very high price over the years. This Bill would appear at last to be correcting the mistake which was made so many years ago. The tragedy is that it would appear that this Government only responds to the bludgeon. They respond to the bludgeon of blood, tears and lost treasure before they at last learn their lesson and do something statesmanlike and what we on these benches have tried to point out to them as being the correct course for so long. We on these benches are very pleased indeed that the hon. the Minister has brought this Bill before the House, this Bill which seeks to update education for Black people, a sphere which has been so sensitive in the relations between Black and White in South Africa for so long, particularly over recent years.</p>
                        <p>We are also very pleased to note that this Bill emerges, as it is on our desks today, as a result of consultation at all levels. It was originally published for information in the 
                            <i>Gazette</i> in November of last year. Arising from that publication many representations were made to the hon. the Minister from all sources&#x2014;from the Black people, from agriculture, from industry and from every person concerned with Black education in South Africa, which of course applies to every individual and every organization in our country. After that publication a new Bill was printed incorporating some of the recommendations arising from the original publication. Then the hon. the Minister, to his credit, submitted the Bill to a Select Committee before Second Reading, and the Bill emerged from that Select Committee again with further improvements which are embodied in the amendments incorporated in the Bill. We on this side of the House are therefore prepared to accept this Bill, not simply because we participated in a meaningful way in its formulation but particularly because the Black people participated in the formulation of this Bill in a really meaningful way. It is to be hoped now that the Black parents of South Africa will feel that they have a worthwhile educational instrument. I would support the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s appeal in this respect that all the Black children and their parents will participate and co-operate to the maximum extent possible in its implementation so that they may enjoy the full benefits which may be derived from this measure. It is quite clear in so far as the Bill itself is concerned, that the education which will emerge as a product of the Bill is equal in all respects to and in a few minor respects even better than the education which emerges as a result of Acts applying to the other population groups of South Africa. We believe that this Bill has been updated and as far as it is possible to provide in legislation, it should provide an educational system equal to any educations system for the other peoples of this land.
                        </p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister mentioned various points. There is provision, for instance, for the vernacular up to Standard II and thereafter for parental choice to be introduced so that the parents may choose what medium of instruction they feel is best for their children. This we believe is correct and is a philosophy which we have propounded for a very long time indeed.</p>
                        <p>There is also recognition in the Bill of the desirability of compulsory general education for Black children. We on this side of the House have promoted this idea although we fully recognize the practical difficulties involved, the financial implications, the problems of providing the necessary teachers, buildings and all the other concomitant problems. These are problems to which the hon. the Minister will have to pay urgent attention if indeed he wishes to provide this compulsory education at the earliest possible date.</p>
                        <p>Therefore we come again to the point that it is action and not words that is required. I have stated that the Bill indicates action on the part of the hon. the Minister. It does to that extent but the Bill as such is again a compilation of words. Those words will be meaningless unless they are accompanied by adequate finance to implement the intentions provided for in the Bill. We are perfectly aware that over the years since 1953 quite inadequate sums have been provided for Black education. The proportion of the budget directed to Black education over recent years has improved materially. I notice from the current budget that an amount of R182 million has been made available which is an increase over last year of R38 million.</p>
                        <p>However, when one views what appears to be a very substantial sum, in relation to the problem and in relation to the number of people who have to be educated, when we have a figure almost of millions of children at school every year, then one realizes how inadequate the sum in fact is and that it is the duty of the hon. the Minister to persuade the hon. the Minister of Finance to direct very much larger sums every year to education for the Black people of this country. An increase of R38 million in one year is substantial in itself but again, related to the need, it is a very inadequate sum indeed. Accordingly I urge the hon. the Minister to accord a very much higher priority to Black education in the future and to raise the budgetary provisions annually by a very much higher percentage than has been done on this occasion. The hon. the Minister and I have both made our appeal to the Black people to participate and to co-operate and not to destroy that which is for their own benefit as unhappily has happened in the past. But an even greater duty lies upon the hon. the Minister and this Government to provide the means so that these people will believe and accept that the hon. the Minister and the Government are really sincere in their desire to provide an adequate education for them. We are aware that it is absolutely necessary to provide schools, teachers and facilities so that the Black people may be educated to take their rightful place as worthy citizens in South Africa and in their own independent states for which the Government, at this stage at any rate, has also to provide substantial sums. Not only is this necessary for the sake of the Black people themselves&#x2014;and we all recognize today that they have a right to this&#x2014;-but it is also necessary in order to enable them to make their rightful contribution to the society and economy of South Africa as a whole. I am glad that the hon. the Minister keeps nodding his head. It is very pleasant to be in accord with a Minister of Education for Black people after so many years of being at loggerheads and contradicting each other; of not even being able to talk to each other on the same level but talking past each other on every occasion.</p>

We have vast natural resources in the form of minerals, in the agricultural sphere and in many others, but the greatest resource of all of any nation is its human resources. We can see this everywhere. The most prosperous nations in the world today, and of the past, are those which with minimal natural physical resources have developed their human resources to the maximum. And I only have to think of Japan and Hong Kong in particular, as examples.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>And Taiwan. Indeed, there are many such countries.</p>
                        <p>I have already referred to the appeal made by the hon. the Minister, which I support. But I would also like to warn the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and I do not believe that he himself will be guilty of what I wish to warn against&#x2014;lest at any stage in the implementation of this Bill, at any stage in the administration of Black education, ideological considerations should intervene. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that no ideological considerations and no taint of discrimination appears within the sphere for which he is responsible. We are aware that over the years his predecessors with their ideological approach to education and other matters relating to the Black people, caused some of the members of the administrative machine to become tainted with this ideology. If there are any of those people in his department who still suffer from that taint, this hon. Minister must ensure that they are made aware that they may not allow ideological considerations to appear on any occasion at all or they will have to pay the price. I believe the hon. the Minister is in duty bound to take a very firm line should there be any evidence among any of his officials of that tendency. And one cannot blame these people because they suffered so long under the régime of previous Ministers who were motivated by ideological instead of humanitarian and practical considerations.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. President, I believe that we are able to support this Bill as a whole. As far as certain aspects are concerned I have sounded a warning to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister is a midwife to this child and I believe that it will be stillborn or it will be a crippled, handicapped youth with all the psychological hangups of such people if the hon. the Minister does not heed my warning.</p>
                        <p>There is only one clause to which we have an objection, and that is clause 2. This arises not because we have no faith in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s control as such. However, clause 2 provides that all final control in education rests in the hands of the Minister of Education and Training. We on this side of the House believe that education is a matter which should be left in the hands of the various race groups concerned, the different communities, and that the only function of a central authority is that of a co-ordinating nature. We believe that each community has a right and a duty to control its own educational matters and that the central authority should only co-ordinate as between the various groups.</p>
                        <p>I am of course aware that under the existing situation it is not possible for the hon. the Minister to provide that system. Our approach to the constitutional make-up of South Africa is substantially different, although here again it would appear that the Select Committee to which my hon. colleague has been appointed, makes provision for including our point of view to some extent at least. But at this stage of course no provision has been made for that new dispensation and we will raise our objection to this clause at the Committee Stage.</p>
                        <p>In other respects we are glad to support a Bill which shows so much improvement over its predecessors and which in the educational field holds out hope that the Black people of South Africa will find satisfaction in the belief, we trust, that their children will enjoy a standard of education at all levels, from the pre-primary to the secondary, equal to the education of all the other peoples in our country.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I have pleasure in congratulating the hon. the Minister on the promotion&#x2014;if one can call it promotion&#x2014;he has received this afternoon. I hope that he will devote his powers, energy and all his experience with great success, and, as we know him, with much dedication to the portfolio now entrusted to him. We wish him health and strength and assure him of our complete support in this department too when he sets out on his new road.</p>
                        <p>I am grateful to be able to say that it is a pleasure for me to agree in principle with what the hon. Senator Henderson had to say. That does not often happen in the House, but in such matters of common nature I am pleased that we have general agreement. I also want to thank him for the constructive contribution he made in regard to the Bill as a whole. I also want to tell him that I appreciate the fact that he not only spoke constructively on the Bill as such but that he also appreciated the attitude and the approach of the hon. the Minister in regard to the handling of a sensitive matter like this.</p>
                        <p>I do not think it is up to me to reply to his objection to clause 2. I think the hon. the Minister will reply to that, or perhaps we can hear more at the Committee Stage about the objection which the hon. Senator and his side of the House have to this. It was good listening to him speaking in such a calm fashion on this matter. He made a contribution from which one could learn in many respects.</p>
                        <p>I have a special appreciation for the concluding remarks of the hon. the Minister when he drew the attention of the House and the country in particular to the fact that this Bill is enabling legislation which enable him to put education for Blacks on the level on which they want it, but that its implementation will depend largely on goodwill and the approach to the provisions of the legislation. We take this opportunity of saying in all modesty to the world, for what it is worth&#x2014;I do not think they listen to us very often but that makes no difference&#x2014;that we can only do as much as we are able to. We cannot do more than we are able to. It is no good putting an Act on the Statute Book when we do not have the means&#x2014;and now I am not referring only to money&#x2014;to implement its provisions. Those means also include the available human material for carrying out the work. Teaching is the maternal profession to all other professions, it makes no difference what colour people are. But we cannot leave it in the hands of untrained people who are unable to do this educational work properly. It will take time before the trained staff and other facilities such as buildings and the infrastructure are established to do the work and implement this measure. I repeat therefore that I noted with great appreciation the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s concluding remarks.</p>
                        <p>I should like to express my personal and I think also this side of the House&#x2019;s appreciation that the principle of mother-tongue education has been embodied in this measure. I had experience of this in 1949 when I had the privilege of being a member of the Transvaal Provincial Council. I participated at the time in a rather unpleasant struggle in the council in regard to a delicate and important matter, i.e. mother-tongue education. I therefore personally really do appreciate the fact that it has been embodied in this Bill. We on this side can do no more than express our gratitude to the Select Committee which considered this Bill. We have noted the amendments and I think we owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister referred to another matter for which I should like to express my thanks. I know I speak for a lot of people when I thank him for his words of appreciation to the many farmers who have built schools on their farms. This has often happened under difficult circumstances, and many farmers possibly did not always have the necessary scientific knowledge, but the goodwill was there. Schools were built and an attempt was made to offer educational opportunities to the Black children on the farms. We are grateful that the hon. the Minister referred to this and, if necessary, I think we want to doubly record the fact that we are grateful for the work that has been done.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I should like to make an appeal on this occasion that in the process of the training and the education of Black children an appreciation and sense of values will be inculcated into them and their parents. The desire to retain what has been put at their disposal must also be engendered in them. Even though facilities do not always comply with the ideals we set, that is what we must strive for. In this connection I think I may well quote a few lines from a poem by A. G. Visser, namely&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">As jy nie het wat jy bemin nie,

                        </block>
                        <p>Let us inculcate this idea in everybody, without any accompanying reproach, so that we do not burn what we have but build upon what has been given with goodwill. The simple fact that this side of the House will not vote against this Bill testifies to the fact that we support the provisions contained therein.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the hon. Senator Van den Berg and I agree with much of what he said. The tone of his remarks was very welcome. However, the hon. Senator referred to mother-tongue education and in this regard I cannot let certain things be said go unanswered. The reputation of the Nationalist Party in regard to mother-tongue education was a very scandalous one, particularly in the Transvaal. The hon. Senator, whose experience in politics is probably longer than mine, will recall the arguments and the rows that went on in the Transvaal province in particular in regard to this question of mother-tongue education. If I remember rightly, a present Minister of the Cabinet, Mr. Marais Steyn, used to wax very eloquent about this matter in a place called Vereeniging where the Transvaal Provincial Council actually changed the law because the parents of a particular school rejected the policy of the province. [Interjections.] I think therefore that the hon. Senator should recall some of the history of his own party in regard to mother-tongue education.</p>
                        <p>But I am not in a quarrelsome mood this afternoon by any manner of means. I do not accept the Bill before us, not for any hard or bitter reasons but for a reason I will explain to the hon. the Minister in a moment.</p>
                        <p>I want to say at the outset that I think the Bill has very many encouraging aspects. I agree with the hon. the Minister that it does herald a new era in the field of Black education. But not the least of the encouraging aspects in regard to the legislation before us is, I believe, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own personality and integrity in matters of this sort. I think that the success of legislation of the nature we are dealing with will to a very large extent depend on the person of the Minister. [Interjections.] I am dealing with the matter in front of me and the matter in front of me at the moment tells me that I can expect great things of the hon. the Minister in this very difficult field.</p>

                        <p>The hon. Senator may think that, but I believe that if a person such as myself can heap praise on a Minister it is better than when it comes from hon. Senators opposite who, every time they get up to speak, do nothing else but spend 10 minutes praising and &#x201C;dankie-ing&#x201D; the Minister. At least I very seldom do it, but when I do do it, it is worth a lot more than when those hon. Senators do it.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the difficulty with legislation of this nature is that it is not altogether in the hands of the Minister who controls the portfolio at the time. Its success also depends largely on the extent to which the Cabinet supports that particular Minister. It is no good the Minister in dealing with the legislation before us wanting to do certain things if he does not get the support of his Cabinet colleagues. They may, for example, block any extra finance that he might need. This is therefore a question for the whole Nationalist. Party Cabinet and all the hon. Senators on the other side who only too seldom apply their minds to matters of this nature. [Interjections.] I cannot hear the hon. Senator Van Schoor. Perhaps he was not educated under this particular Bill.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>I did not say that. I am blamed for many things, Mr. President, but you cannot blame me for that one. The greatest drawback of this legislation, as I see it, is that it entrenches the belief in separation. It is in the spirit of the separation of education, separate legislation in regard to other matters, the separation of labour and the separation of everything we deal with in South Africa. Sir, I believe that this is the problem confronting us today. We have this sort of legislation, good legislation, which takes us a good deal further than we have been in the past, but which cripples itself, handicaps itself, because it is still hidebound by this philosophy that things must be separated. I believe this is the major flaw in the Bill and I believe it could become a fatal flaw in the education system of South Africa as it has become in other things. I am sorry to have to say that to my mind this is the greatest disappointment to me in what otherwise would have been good legislation.</p>
                        <p>There is no question but that we are moving away from apartheid in small matters. We are moving away from it in minor details but the major principles are still being entrenched; they are being entrenched in new legislation and I believe that some day we will come to regret this.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister concluded his speech by saying that Black education is beneficial not only to the Blacks but also to the Whites and to South Africa as a whole. I could not agree with him more, but then I ask, why does he chain it? Why does he shackle it with measures of this nature so that we are always seen to be operating separately? I do not understand the logic of the thinking that does this to us.</p>
                        <p>You know, Sir, in the Army, in our front lines&#x2014;we might say in the front lines against apartheid or in the defence of apartheid&#x2014;our soldiers are serving together; they are living together and, unfortunately, dying together in some cases. But apartheid, separation, is a thing of the past; it does not exist any more, and rightly so. There is no separate command in the Army; we do not have a separate command for the Africans in the Army or a separate command for the Coloureds or the Indians. It is one unified command; it would never work any other way. I do not understand why it cannot work in regard to education, because no matter what one might say about defence and anything else in South Africa, there can be no doubt that the education of the people of South Africa, all the people of South Africa, is South Africa&#x2019;s greatest and best defence. I do not believe anybody would dispute that. That is why I say to the hon. the Minister that I am disappointed that he should still find, wittingly or unwittingly, that he has to shackle this legislation, good legislation, to this major flaw which can destroy us.</p>
                        <p>The NRP are supporting this legislation because they believe that each ethnic group should control its own affairs. I am not quarrelling with that principle but where I do draw a line is, that I do not believe one can control one&#x2019;s own affairs unless one can control the pursestrings that go with it. While the Whites of South Africa govern, they control the purse strings in South Africa, and no matter how much independence one gives to other groups, other nationalities, other ethnic groups, no matter how much independence there is in the field of education or in any other field, while one controls the pursestrings one controls one&#x2019;s destiny. It might well be said that the Africans will now control their destiny to a larger extent but that argument is somewhat destroyed by clause 2 which the hon. Senator Henderson also had some qualms about. But even ignoring that, Mr. President, if one does not control the pursestrings one does not finally control one&#x2019;s affairs. I believe that this will in fact bring politics more deeply into Black education. Unfortunately it has caused problems in the past, and I believe that it will cause problems again because here where we have had the opportunity to move away from the things that caused the problem in the past, we have in fact entrenched it once more in this new legislation. I see that, Sir, as a great disappointment, a major disappointment, and I must say that I am very sorry that the hon. the Minister did not take this opportunity to correct this state of affairs.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister accepts that changes are necessary, and I accept that he is a hundred per cent sincere when he makes that statement. But he says that these things cannot be accomplished overnight. I do not quarrel too much with that either, except that I would say to him that they must be tackled as though they had to be complished overnight. That is the problem. One cannot sit back and say: I cannot do this now; it is a long-term project, this question of compulsory free education&#x2014;which is the ideal of the hon. the Minister and everybody else&#x2014; but it cannot be done overnight. I believe that we must say that it has got to be done overnight, and then we will find that we will come close to getting it done in that period, because this is the only way to approach it.</p>
                        <p>You know, Sir, when it comes to matters of this sort it seems that we are able to find money when it is absolutely necessary. The price of oil has just been increased beyond our imagination of a year ago. But suddenly we can find the money. We had to find it and we did find it. Our Defence budget has been increased many times over the past few years, and rightly so, but, Sir, we found the money because we had to. I am saying to the hon. the Minister that we have got to find the money. It seems to be an awe-inspiring task that we are faced with, but there is no alternative, Mr. President. We have to find the money to bring about the better education of our Black people a lot quicker than probably any of us think is possible.</p>
                        <p>As I said just now, this is our greatest defence&#x2014; the proper education of the mass of our people. I say, therefore, that we must get our priorities right. The hon. Senator Henderson mentioned them. Let us get our priorities right because at the moment they are nowhere near correct.</p>
                        <p>I want to quote to the hon. the Minister, for the record, a question that I asked in 1977, and he probably knows this. This was just two years ago, and two years ago we spent R554 million on educating 918 000 White pupils. We spent R114 million on educating 650 000 Coloureds. We spent R44 million on educating 187 000 Indians. But we spent R152 million on educating 3 898 000 African students. If one does the obvious little sum, it works out that we were spending R600-odd on educating a White student and no more than R40 on educating an African student. That was the figure two years ago. One might say that it has improved since then. In fact, the Government likes to say that the situation has improved considerably since then, but let us look at the figure at present. The hon. Senator Henderson mentioned the total amount spent. We are now spending something like R700 a year on a White child and R70 on an African child. This is Government spending on education. In other words, two years ago the gap between what we spent on an African and a White child was R560; that gap, despite the increase, has now widened to R630. What sort of argument is it then when the Government says that it is now spending more on Black education, or that it is increasing the amount percentagewise, than it is spending on White education? That is perfectly true, but the gap widens nevertheless because the percentages are not big enough. I am sure the hon. the Minister knows this, but this is the point which must be brought home to the public of South Africa. For the peace and the well-being and the future of South Africa we are going to have to pay. We are going to have to pay in guns or we are going to have to pay in education and I say we must pay in education because it will save us in the long run from having to pay in guns. This is what our future will depend on. I am not throwing anything at the hon. the Minister; I am not trying to put any heat into the debate. What I am trying to get across is the urgency of the matter that is before us. I know the hon. the Minister believes it is urgent and if he wants me to help him to let the public know how urgent it is I shall be only too happy to do so. But, Sir, we must get our priorities right&#x2014;the Government must get them right. We must spend more money on education; we must spend more money on Black education until it hurts, because in the long run that will be our only security.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister says he is not prepared to lower the standard of White education by using the money earmarked for White educations for Black education. I do not quarrel with that, Sir; I think he is quite right. One does not lower the standard of Whites to uplift the standard of Blacks. That would be ridiculous, but one must uplift the standard of Blacks. The hon. the Minister agrees. It is going to cost more money and I say let us find the money. Let us find the money even if it hurts because in the long term this will mean our survival. It is true that the whole system of education is changing. In the case of White education, for instance, there are fewer private schools today than there were ten years ago. In my own experience the number of Catholic schools is decreasing rapidly. Unfortunately, this seems to be the trend because the costs are too high. So the pattern of education is changing and the private schools are disappearing to a greater extent than ever before. I believe this is unfortunate because education is losing a special aspect which is necessary. In the case of African education my records show that in 1962 there were 780 private schools, mission schools, church schools, etc. with 90 000 pupils. In other words, they were playing a very major role in the field of African education. But in 1972, ten years later, the number of such schools had dropped to almost half&#x2014;to 503 to be exact&#x2014;but they still had 85 000 pupils. In other words, the private schools, the Black church schools were also feeling the economic pinch and were unable to carry on just as the White schools are feeling the pinch today. This is a change in our education pattern which is, I believe, to be regretted, and it is something to which the department of the hon. the Minister should pay greater attention. It may mean increased subsidies to church or religious schools, but this must be done because they play an important part in education.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, no matter how unfair it might seem, under our present system of education it will always be said that the Government is discriminating against Black education because Black education, while it remains separate, will be seen to be discriminatory. If the hon. the Minister were to say to me that he is not discriminating I would agree with him, but the message will come across loud and clear that everything that goes wrong in Black education&#x2014;and things sometimes go wrong beyond the control of human beings&#x2014;will be seen to have gone wrong because it is separated. That is a tragedy that should be avoided. We experienced it in Soweto. No matter how hard one tries, people will say that because it is separate it is being discriminated against This is why I do not understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s ready acceptance that Black education in South Africa must be separated. There should be one controlling body for education. The education of all the population groups should be controlled by one body, so that if something goes wrong in respect of one section, if a particular section of the community is not working as well as it should, it will not be seen as discrimination. Today it will be and it will continue to be seen as discrimination. As I have said, even with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own charisma and compassion for this particular subject he will not be able to avoid that accusation. It will stick. I say: never mind the political mistakes the Government makes, but this is a mistake that is embodied in this Bill.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister has told us about the amount of consultation that has taken place. That is correct and he should be congratulated on it but I want to quote some of the reports in regard to that consultation. The biggest complaint of the Transvaal United African Teachers&#x2019; Association was, in fact, that the Bill provided for separate bodies for education on a racial basis. That was one; time does not permit me to quote them all. The hon. the Minister knows the reports to which I am referring. They objected to separate teachers&#x2019; councils in very responsible language. I do not think the hon. the Minister could object to the language that they used to express their objections. The Federal Council of Transvaal African School Boards resolved unanimously that the draft Education and Training Bill be rejected totally in principle in favour of the implementation of a unitary education system. In other words, they make the same point. Those are the African people themselves. But the White people are making a similar appeal&#x2014;not politicians, not people like myself who, you may say, Sir, has an axe to grind and can see very little right in the Government anyway. That is probably true, I see very little that is right with them. But the people who reject this Bill are not politicians like myself. The Durban Chamber of Commerce objects to this Bill. I have argued with them politically on many occasions because I do not think their thinking is right politically. They say there should be one body controlling education in South Africa. Assocom says there should be one body for education in South Africa and they are not politicians, Sir. So I say to the hon. the Minister that I like his Bill; there is much about it that I like, but I believe he has ruined it by insisting that we should be separated at all costs in things like education which is a very important matter.</p>
                        <p>Before I resume my seat, I should like to put one question to the hon. the Minister because my time is limited. I should like to refer him to clause 40. I shall be as brief as I can. The marginal note states: &#x201C;Unauthorized persons may not visit certain schools or enter school grounds or school premises.&#x201D; I want to say immediately to the hon. the Minister that obviously one cannot have every Tom, Dick and Harry walking into a school. So I accept straightaway that there must be some control. However, clause 40(d) says&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">A parent or guardian in connection with the education of his child, or for the purpose of attending a sports meeting, concert or any other event of the school in which his child has an interest.</block>
                        <p>The way this paragraph reads, it would seem that the parent or guardian can attend the school in which his child is but he would seem to be prohibited, as I read the provision, from going to another school where his child may perhaps be engaged in a concert or sporting event. This is how it reads but I shall be very pleased to hear from the hon. the Minister that that interpretation is not correct. I am quite sure that that is not what is meant by the paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Clause 40(f) read&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Members of the community who at the request &#x2026;</block>
                        <p>This has now been changed to read&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">&#x2026; who at the invitation of the principal attend a particular school activity.</block>
                        <p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister what he means by &#x201C;a member of the community&#x201D; in this respect. Say, for instance, I belong to the St. John Ambulance Brigade and my organization wants to go and give a lecture at a particular school on the Red Cross or something of that nature. We are not members of that community, if one assumes that it is the African community to which reference is made here. It would seem to me that we would have to get permission from the school principal. That is perfectly correct; obviously one cannot go into a school just like that. But lower down it says &#x201C;certain people&#x201D;&#x2014;and I am talking about that type of person&#x2014;&#x201C;may not enter a school without the written permission of the Secretary&#x201D;. Bearing in mind the type of person who should be allowed to enter a school, the type of person whose presence may be to the benefit of the school, the school principal should surely be the person to decide who should or should not come into his school. If one has to write to the Secretary it could be a very involved process. I am confident in my own mind that the school principal is not going to allow the wrong sort of people to come into his school. This is obviously what the hon. the Minister is trying to prevent. This is what I am trying to prevent. I do not want those sort of people in the schools but I do believe that the way it is framed at the moment it might preclude or it might make it difficult for an organization such as a drama society or the St. John Ambulance Brigade or some such other body to pursue its activities at a school. I believe those decisions should be left to the principal of the school.</p>
                        <p>With those few remarks I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I shall oppose this legislation, not because I do not think it is good legislation; I do; but, unfortunately for me, it embodies something which my philosophy tells me is bad in practice, which is in fact dangerous to and not good for the wellbeing of the future of South Africa. I would like to see one controlling body for all education, and I am sorry the hon. the Minister has not taken the opportunity to effect that change in this case. On the other hand, I believe that his attitude to the problem, his attitude to the subject is a very welcome one and a very healthy one. However, because my objections are so strong I shall have to oppose the Bill before us.</p>

I am pleased that the hon. the Minister took over the portfolio at the time he did. I really do think he is the right man for this portfolio and I say this from personal observation over a number of years. It is a pity that at this stage, when he is performing such constructive work in this connection, he has to do something else. It is not in our hands, but I just want to say that I appreciate &#x2026;</p>

                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>An hon. Senator says now that he is taking over White education. I am absolutely sure that he will do that too to the best of his ability. His attitude in this connection, in this important portfolio, has always given me pleasure.</p>
                        <p>I should like to raise a few matters in this connection. In the first place I want to say that I was pleased to hear the hon. the Minister say that the education levy will remain but that it will be spent in another way, viz. for sports facilities for the Black child. It is a fact that with a healthy body one acquires a healthy mind. I am also very pleased that the parents of these children are being asked to contribute to this facility. One can of course say that the things one gets for nothing one does not appreciate as much as the things one works for.</p>
                        <p>The other point on which I can fortunately agree with the hon. Senator G. P. van den Berg&#x2014;and I hope he feels now that he is on the right road&#x2014;is in regard to the contribution the farming community makes to the education of Black children on farms. In that regard I am very pleased to see that we will also be given the opportunity of getting secondary education in the rural areas. I think of a previous argument we had in this hon. House when former hon. Ministers stood firm by the decision that primary school education could be given in the rural areas but that the children on farms should be sent to their homelands to receive their secondary education there. I am very pleased that there has been this change in attitude.</p>
                        <p>I do not want to cross swords with Senators on this side of the House who have had so much to say about spending more and more on Black education. I agree one hundred per cent with that. I think we must spend as much as we possibly can. That is in the interests of everybody in the country. But we must also take care that we do not put everything on a plate for them. In this regard I should like to refer to a very important point. In my area we have two black spots which over the years have unfortunately become the orphans of the department. I speak of the black spots Leeufontein and Braklaagte in the Marico district. I mentioned this as a good example when we had this burning down of schools in the Black urban areas. The department has withdrawn its assistance there over the years. But that community built its own classrooms. Under the guidance of their headman, Chief Sibagodi, they now have schools there which accommodate more than 1 000 children. These are buildings they have erected themselves. During those riots not one single window pane was broken in that school and not a single classroom was burned.</p>
                        <p>The second point I want to put to the hon. the Minister refers to the removal of those people. I have already brought this to the attention of his successor. I feel that when those people are removed we must take care that facilities, particularly as far as their schools are concerned, are established in the region where they are to be resettled. I do not know what the position will be and how much compensation etc. they will get for the school buildings which they have erected with their own money. I make this appeal therefore, and I have already brought this to the attention of Dr. Hartzenberg, because it will make the removal that much easier. I think in any event it will take place without any bad feelings if the facilities which they have enjoyed here are also established for them there, especially in the field of education. I should like to support this legislation. I think it is a step in the right direction. The hon. the Minister said in his final remarks that we were now entering a new era in Black education. He is man enough to admit that we may perhaps not have done sufficient in the past and that there were weaknesses. I agree with him one hundred per cent that this investment in Black education is not only to the advantage of the Black man and the Black child but also of the whole of South Africa. I should like to support him completely in this Bill. There may be weaknesses. There may be things we do not really like. But in general it will be worthwhile if we all give our full support to this matter.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I find it difficult to thank everybody for their kind words, but when I say thank you, it comes from my heart.</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to what has been said about my going to another department, I myself find it something of a &#x2026; well, I really cannot call it a disappointment because I am going to a department where I really want to serve. But I should also have liked to remain longer in this department. I can only testify to the large measure of goodwill that I have encountered from the officials in the department, from my colleagues on this side of the House, both here and in the Other Place, and also from the people from whom I differ politically and we make no secret about it. I also knew that if I was straight with them, I should always have the necessary respect from them in return. I should like by way of a farewell to ask hon. Senators on both sides of the House to give this department and its officials who do a particularly difficult job of work the support which I do not think they always receive. There were a few remarks which I know were not ill-meant. There was one which I think was made by the hon. Senator Henderson.</p>
                        <p>†If I remember correctly, the hon. Senator Henderson mentioned people suffering under a &#x201C;taint&#x201D;. I hope that it was not meant in an unfriendly manner.</p>

                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>I accept that it was not said in an unfriendly way towards officials in my department because I want to state without fear of contradiction that I have never seen so much devotion to a thankless task at times, as I have seen in the Department of Education for Blacks. Both White and Black people have under very trying circumstances at times, fulfilled a mammoth task over many years.</p>
                        <p>*I should like to ask for that goodwill on behalf of South Africa. Mr. President, I believe in the policy of the NP. It is no use fighting about it today because I think that the policy of the NP in relation to the development of the independent homelands is also the right policy for South Africa. We may differ on this but in the first place I want to point out that we can build the most wonderful railway lines, erect the most luxurious buildings and have the finest homes for Ministers and the best parliamentary buildings in the country but for that policy to succeed, if the people are not trained to govern the country, the policy of this side of the House is doomed. So if there are still people who are under the wrong impression that what we spend on the Black people is really contrary to the policy of the NP, I want to say with the greatest emphasis that such people do not understand the policy of the NP. They are trying to wreck the policy and the success that the NP has achieved. To educate people in our own country and in our neighbouring states to govern themselves at every level where expertise is necessary&#x2014;in the commercial field and in a proper public service where corruption and other things will not prevail&#x2014;is a prerequisite for an infrastructure of any sort. The education and the training that is necessary and the character-forming of the Black people, just as with the White people, are necessary for the policy of the NP to succeed. And we on this side of the House must consider this as what we are earnestly striving for for South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President I also think it is one&#x2019;s Christian duty not to begrudge others what one claims for oneself. It is easy to say that the people must look after themselves. I was formerly a minister of religion and I know that somewhere the Bible says&#x2014;perhaps the hon. Senator on my right can tell us where it appears&#x2014;that if a man comes to you and tells you that he is hungry, and you say to him: &#x201C;Go away and feed yourself&#x201D; or if a man comes to you and says he is naked and you say to him: &#x201C;Go away and get warm,&#x201D; then you are like a Pharisee; then you have done nothing and less than nothing for him. These people are our responsibility; they have been given to us and we have a duty to help them to develop to their full potential. Sir, I think we shall reap the benefit if we work together in this direction.</p>
                        <p>I have no doubt that this legislation is the foundation on which we can build. It offers guidelines in terms of which we must work and I am convinced that it can serve as a means to achieve that objective.</p>
                        <p>†But I would like to remind the hon. Senator Henderson&#x2014;and I plead with him to accept this&#x2014;that Rome was not built in a day. The hon. Senator Winchester apologized for having to leave, but I would like to say the same to him: Rome was not built in a day. But I agree with both hon. Senators. I think we should at all times realize that merely getting blueprints and five year plans or ten year plans will not get us anywhere. He who has to walk a thousand miles has to take the first step. If we cannot build 7 000 class-rooms this year, then at least let us not make it imperative that next year we will need 7 700, because we did not even build 700 or 7 for that matter. What can be done today should not be left for tomorrow. I think within the framework of this Bill so many things can be achieved.</p>
                        <p>I was asked by both the hon. Senator Winchester and the hon. Senator Henderson about the financial aspect. Sir, I would like to assure the hon. House that it was not merely a matter of getting an Act on the Statute Book that we concerned ourselves with over the past months. And once again I have to pay tribute to the officials of my department and others who worked with us, even bodies such as the Urban Foundation and other people who interest themselves in the field of education for Blacks. Because we did not merely leave it at framing a Bill that has to become an Act. There is the greatest understanding on the part of the Cabinet as a whole for the urgency of this matter which we are at present discussing.</p>
                        <p>*I am grateful that I can say something here today which I was not able to say in the Other Place when the Third Reading was discussed. Representations and the same argument advanced by the hon. Senator Henderson were put to me in the Other Place by the hon. member for Durban Central as to how we would obtain the necessary funds. I can say today that the Cabinet agreed at its penultimate meeting that through other people who help us, we can obtain loans on foreign markets at low rates of interests, even as low as 3% I am told, repayable over a long period. There are very sympathetic people overseas who would like to help us in this respect. The Minister of Finance has given his approval, it has been cleared with the Department of Finance through my officials, and I believe my successor will be in a position within the next few weeks to start using this financing pattern. Provision for interest and repayments will be given priority each year in the budget.</p>
                        <p>†I think that this will enable us to catch up with the backlog much sooner than we in our wildest dreams had dared to hope.</p>
                        <p>*I hope that my successor will have the pleasure of being able to report favourably on this next year to Parliament.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I must mention the assistance we have received from various institutions, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, the Johannesburg Municipality and Bantu Administration boards, as far as the rebuilding of schools and the building of additional classrooms are concerned. I might just mention that the officials of my department have not been idle during these months; they have worked. In 1976, 20 000 children left Soweto and, at the beginning of this year, 15 000 returned, in addition to the others whose numbers had increased in the mean time, and we could accommodate them. Within a matter of two months we found accommodation for those students with which their parents were satisfied. I think this is an achievement on the part of the department which we should note, and this took place with the co-operation of people who want to be helpful at all times.
                        </p>
                        <p>†The hon. Senator Winchester asked me about one department. Well, Sir, I do not want to cross swords with him, especially not in his absence.</p>

                        <p>No, in fairness to the hon. Senator Winchester I must mention that he wrote me a note in which he explained that he had to catch an aircraft to Durban and apologized for his absence.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator made a few statements about mother-tongue education and about one department. I do not want to look far for witnesses to support my attitude but the PFP is always talking about enforced segregation and discrimination.</p>
                        <p>†I have it here in black and white and will show it to anyone who is interested&#x2014;hon. Senators from Natal will bear me out&#x2014;that at a graduation ceremony no less a person than Chief Minister Buthelezi said that anyone asking for the Black education department to be incorporated in the White department is a fool. Chief Buthelezi, a leader of the Black people, said this. I can quote so many people who have insisted that they want their own separate department. What is more, I do not think we always remember our own history. Is it not true that with Union in 1910 there was just one department of education? But the Union Parliament did not want to accept responsibility for the education of Blacks so they farmed it out to the provinces. The provinces, because they also handled education for Whites, did nothing about it. During this period the missionaries did a tremendous job of trying to alleviate the shortages of staff and facilities. They did what the government of the day did not want to do. It was only in 1953 that Black education became a department and the full responsibility of the central Government. The solution therefore does not lie in making it one department. We can make it one department tomorrow, but we still cannot build 7 000 classrooms just because we have made it one department. &#x201C;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&#x201D; Certainly, Sir, a department by any other name will not bring about the changes which are needed in this department.</p>

                        <p>I thank the official Opposition in this House for agreeing with me, as well as the hon. Senator Du Toit, but I am merely replying to what the hon. Senator Winchester said in order to put the record straight.</p>
                        <p>I want to mention a second instance and I do not intend to keep hon. Senators too long. The hon. Senator Van den Berg spoke about mother-tongue education.</p>
                        <p>*This to me is one of the amazing things about the PFP and something I cannot understand. There are seven different homelands, developing areas, independent-to-be states or whatever one wants to call them. The first thing each of those seven states says is that it wants its own department of education. They want a say over their own education. I want to say something else. When I again became Minister of the department, I asked people in Soweto why there were 16 different school boards. The Secretary of the Department then said to me that the department had to take the wishes of the parents into consideration. The Tswanas said that they did not want to serve on the same school board as the Zulus and that they wanted their own school board. They do that, and these are not silly stories.</p>
                        <p>On another occasion I spent a whole day with people like Prof. Ntsanwisi, Dr. Phatudi and Chief Mangope, now President Mangope, negotiating certain matters. They gave me leave to repeat this. Just outside Pretoria there is an area which falls under Bophuthatswana, i.e. Garankuwa, and the Winterveld region. All the Blacks who in the time of Dr. Verwoerd worked in Pretoria were resettled there from Sophiatown and other places.</p>
                        <p>They also had their own schools but the resettlement was not done on an ethnic basis. It took myself and the Commissioner-General a whole day to make peace in the end. The then Chief Minister Mangope said that the children could go to school there but that they had to learn Tswana. The Sothos said over their dead bodies would that be done. The people of Gazankulu said the same. We were compelled to lay out the town of Mabopane. Those who do not believe me can go and have a look at that town. It is in the trust area, and the first things we built were schools to accommodate the children who could not go to school in Bophuthatswana. In the meantime I thought I was very clever. We built it as an international town and those who are interested in national relationships must remember what I am now going to say. I agreed with other people that we had to think up a joint or combined name for the town. We then decided to take the first letters of the different nations, i.e. the Sotho, the Shangaan, the Nguni and the Venda and to make a name from these. So we arrived at the name Soshanguve. The first thing that happened after that was that the Vendas came to us and asked why they came at the end of the word. Then the Ngunis came and asked why they were in the middle of the name. They wanted to be at the beginning because they had the most children. That name fell away and we now call the town Mabopane. That is how set people are on their languages. Language is, after all, part of one&#x2019;s soul. It is the same for the Black man, and anyone who does not believe that does not believe a truth which is as old as the hills. In this connection I can show hon. Senators documents from Unesco and the Organization of African Unity in which it is claimed that dispense the practice of forcing English down peoples&#x2019; throats must be dispensed with.</p>
                        <p>†My English-speaking friends will forgive me now if I tell them what I read. We know that English is a world language. I think it is necessary that English be taught to Afrikaansspeaking people and to everybody else, because it is a world language the same as French is. I think that a person who has mastered English can get somewhere in the world. We have to teach English to our Black pupils. But what did the Blacks say when they tried to do that in Nigeria? They branded it a new method of colonialization and told their children not to speak a word of English.</p>

                        <p>Yes, but they said that in the field of education it was a method of colonalization and they insisted that English should be done away with as a medium of instruction in schools and that only the vernacular should be used. Those are facts.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion I want to refer to a very important matter which the hon. Senator Du Toit raised, i.e. the question of the removal of Black spots without providing the necessary facilities. I am pleased that this matter has been placed on record because I feel it cannot be over-emphasized. People must not only be supplied with houses in other areas but they must also have the necessary facilities. I hope my friends in the Cape will accept it in that spirit if my successor starts building schools for the people of Crossroads. One cannot move the people of Crossroads and then expect them to stay in those houses while their children roam the streets. I hope people will give my successor the opportunity to move happy children if they have to be moved as has been planned. I think it is important that attention should be given to this aspect. I Should like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the hon. Senators who have participated in the discussion, particularly the hon. Senator Van den Berg.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">C. C. HENDERSON</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to speak on this clause which provides for the control and administration of Black education and the organizing of and reporting on activities of the department, to be under the control of the Minister. It provides, in fact, for all control in the final analysis to be in the hands of the Minister.</p>
                        <p>In my Second Reading speech I pointed out that in this regard there is a philosophical difference between this side of the House and that of the hon. the Minister. We believe that each community should control its own education. I am very glad to note that the hon. the Minister himself supports this principle. He quoted the words of the Chief Minister of kwaZulu and other people, and on that basis we are unable to support the clause. We do not support the Bill in general terms, but this particular clause is not in accord with our approach to education which is based on the decentralization of all matters which are of concern to the respective communities. As the hon. the Minister himself agrees, education is one of those matters which are of peculiar interest&#x2014;I emphasize that word &#x201C;peculiar&#x201D;&#x2014;to the communities concerned.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister mentioned the history of education in South Africa. I made notes on this particular point to illustrate our point of view, i.e. that up to 1953 all education was controlled by the provinces. May I add, Mr. Chairman, that a great deal of success was achieved under that system. I think of Natal where the Indian people are the best educated group of people, other than the Whites, in South Africa, and I believe that credit for that must go to the Natal Provincial Administration. I know of a man who is regarded by this Government as a radical&#x2014;I am not sure that he is&#x2014;and is a leader of the Coloured people in Natal who was asked recently whether he would like Coloured education to be restored to the Province of Natal, and he said he would emphatically prefer that to the present system of centralized control.</p>
                        <p>When we say that we wish to decentralize the control of education to the various communities we do not advocate this in the sense of apartheid as we have come to know apartheid. The hon. Senator Winchester who has left, constantly emphasized this question of apartheid, but we do not view the separation of those matters which are peculiar to the respective communities as a question of apartheid. We view these matters as those over which the different communities desire to exercise control, in their own interests, for emotional and practical reasons, and over which they do not desire people who are not of their community to exercise control. It is in this sense that we wish to decentralize the control of education.</p>
                        <p>In so far as control of the purse-strings is concerned, we believe that the various communities will also have taxation powers over their own communities and so they will also be able to make a contribution to their own education. But obviously for a long time the Blacks will not have sufficient financial resources to pay for all their own education, and the central administration, federal or confederal, will have to provide a very substantial proportion of that finance, and possibly the major portion, depending on when our system can be introduced. But the Black people, as they advance educationally, will also advance economically, and they will be able to assume an ever-increasing proportion of the responsibility for their own education. So even on that issue we find no difficulty in pursuing our philosophical approach.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons I am unable to support clause 2.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, may I respectfully point out to the hon. Senator that I do not think he has read this clause together with the other clauses. Clause 2(1) states&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">It shall be the function of the department under the direction and control of the Minister to perform all the work necessary for or incidental to the general administration of education for Blacks.</block>
                        <p>I repeat, &#x201C;general administration&#x201D;. Surely there must be a central body or department dealing with general administration and through which reports can be submitted to Parliament and to the Controller and Auditor-General.</p>
                        <p>Subsection (2) reads&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">The department may organize its activities or any part thereof in regions and inspection circuits determined by the Minister from time to time.</block>
                        <p>So the whole concept of decentralization is contained in this subsection. Subsection (3) refers to the report which has to be submitted annually. But this clause must in addition, be read together with clause 3. This states, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;
                        </p>
                        <block name="quote">The Minister may after consultation with, or consideration of proposals made by, the Council &#x2026;</block>
                        <p>which is defined&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">(f) that recognition be given to the active involvement of the parents and the communities in the education system through parent-teachers&#x2019; associations, local or domestic committees or councils or in any similar authoritative manner.</block>
                        <p>Then there is clause 7 which provides for school boards, if they are required. It reads, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;
                        </p>
                        <block name="quote">With a view to providing for the active involvement by parents and the community in education and in order to make provision that the Secretary shall be advised regarding prescribed matters &#x2026; the Minister may for any such school &#x2026; establish such local or domestic councils &#x2026;</block>
                        <p>I agree fully with what the hon. Senator says, but it is decentralized and when one reads the clause referring to the Council, one finds it is stipulated that as far as possible these people should be Black parents themselves. When one reads the Bill one finds that the whole idea of the hon. Senator is embodied in it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the hon. the Minister. The department is concerned basically, apart from its other activities in the homelands, with education for Black children in our so-called White areas. If one takes the example which the hon. the Minister has given us, we realize that what is at issue is what happened at Mabopane. I do not think it is practical to say that it must be left to the various ethnic groups. It can happen, and I think sufficient provision has already been made for this, but I should also like to bring this point home very clearly to the hon. the Minister. The department will chiefly be concerned with the education of the Black people within the so-called White area.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I am aware of the points the hon. the Minister has made but of course, the examples to which the hon. the Minister has referred, namely the active involvement of parents and communities in the educational system, together with the reference to clause 7, only refer to the very localized bodies such as parent-teachers&#x2019; associations and Soweto control. They are not in keeping with what we believe should be the case. When I refer to community control of education, I am not referring purely to the local community. I am referring to control of education by all the Zulu people, by all the Tswana people, by all the Ciskei people. I am speaking, in that sense. I appreciate that in terms of this Bill and with the existing constitutional set-up as we have it in South Africa with a centralized control, it is in fact not possible for the hon. the Minister to meet me. I accept this. It will be impossible for the hon. the Minister to decentralize to the extent that we contemplate because of the existing constitutional dispensation in South Africa. But I am opposing clause 2 so as to emphasize our approach&#x2014;not because I oppose the Bill as a whole, not because in terms of the Bill as such I disagree with the necessity of including clause 2&#x2014;which is to place on record the fact that in the field of education the NRP wishes to see the control of education devolve upon each of the communities which we visualize will be communities in terms of our federal/confederal set-up. It is for those reasons that we want it on record that it is because of this policy approach that we oppose clause 2. We oppose it for no other reason. I accept that the hon. the Minister cannot, with the best will in the world, accept the deletion of this clause but we oppose it for the reasons I have just stated and we shall have to remain adamant in our opposition to it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot understand how it is at all possible for this to work in a practical way even under the policy of the NRP. Let us take the case of Soweto. How does the hon. Senator suggest education in Soweto should be controlled? Should the education of the Zulu children be controlled from kwaZulu? Perhaps if I were to sit down the hon. Senator would explain how this can be written into legislation so that it can work in a practical way.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty because he is thinking in terms of the situation as it exists now. This is a very good Bill for that situation. But let me take the hon. the Minister back to his own party&#x2019;s constitutional plans. The constitutional plan of the Government visualizes a parliament for the Indian people, a parliament for the Coloured people and a parliament for the Whites. Those parliaments will control the education of their own people. There is no question about that. We say that the shortcoming in that plan is that there is no provision for a parliament for the urban Black man. What we are saying when we object to clause 2, is that we see the future constitutional pattern of this country as including not only a parliament for the Coloured people, a parliament for the Indian people and a parliament for the White people, but a parliament for the urbanized Black people as well. We have no objection to the self-governing Black territories running their own show. I always say it is not for me to tell the Xhosa how to educate his child and by the same token I do not expect the Xhosa to tell me how I must educate my child. So there is no problem about the self-governing Black territories such as kwaZulu and the Ciskei. Obviously there is no problem either about the independent ones, but we come back to this residual problem of the urban Black man who is not attached to a homeland. [Interjections.] Yes, and the ones on White farms. All we are saying when we oppose this clause in principle is that there should be an authority established to run Black education in the urban areas, an authority controlled by the Black man. That is all we say. There should be such an authority; just as the hon. the Minister can make out a case for Coloured education to be controlled by the Coloured man and for Indian education to be controlled by the Indian man, because that is the situation that the Government&#x2019;s constitutional plan visualizes. We are simply saying that we want to see a similar set-up for the urban Black man. We want the urban Black man to have a parliament one of whose functions should be the responsibility of seeing to the education of the Black man. We are not saying that this is a bad Bill; we say it is a very excellent Bill within the constitutional framework which exists at the moment. But we see a different constitutional framework, not the hon. Senator Winchester&#x2019;s integrated constitution in which all education will be controlled by one centralized body. I do not see how the hon. Senator Winchester can even reconcile that with his own party&#x2019;s policy. He is not here now, so I will not go any further into that. We see a parliament for the urban Black man as well, including the Black man on the farms &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senators Horak and Henderson spoke about Nigeria and it seemed to me that they did not quite believe it. I should like to quote something in this connection about mother-tongue education. It was written by A. Babs Fafunwa of the University of Ife in Nigeria. It reads&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">The broad aim of an integrated primary school curriculum is to help the child develop his natural abilities by creating the necessary environment &#x2026;</block>
                        <p>†Then he says the following in regard to education in the mother-tongue&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Hypotheses: Indeed language patterns and other cultural milieu are so closely related that there is a reciprocal influence between them. The child&#x2019;s language is an integral part of his culture and the mother-tongue is the best medium for educating him; but if for any other extraneous reason, we cannot do this, it is not because the other media are better.</block>
                        <p>Then he comes to his conclusion and says&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">&#x2026; that his command of English will be improved considerably if he is taught English as an entirely separate subject by a specially trained teacher throughout the six years.</block>
                        <p>But they insist on mother-tongue education. If any hon. Senator is interested in this, Sir, I have here the full document on how the Organization of African Unity stressed this expressly.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Senator Winchester asked me what the requirements would be if one went to a school. The reply is that just as in the case of White schools, the principal is in charge of this matter. If an Act provides that the Secretary or the Minister must give consent, it is always understood that the Minister or the Secretary has the right of delegation. It is a perfectly normal thing, as in the case with White education, for powers to be delegated to the principal.</p>
                        <p>†This clause was inserted especially because the principals of the Black schools insisted that they be assisted in some way to keep out insurance agents, salesmen, etc. as they have not been able to stop them from coming to the schools. That is why they expressed a desire for this. I merely want to put it on record because the hon. Senator Winchester asked me about it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I would just like to make one or two comments at this Third Reading stage of the Bill. The hon. the Minister stated that Rome was not built in a day so far as the developments are concerned. I accept that and I stated that in my Second Reading speech in different words. However, I do wish to emphasize again the urgent priority which it is necessary to give to this matter.</p>
                        <p>I also agree with the hon. the Minister that there should be no reduction in educational standards for Whites. We on this side of the House believe in the private enterprise system which creates wealth for the benefit of all. Socialism believes in reducing everybody to the lowest common denominator. If the hon. the Minister were to reduce the standard of education for Whites, the only effect would be to reduce the standard of education for everybody. Every attempt must be made therefore to raise the education of Blacks to the level of that of Whites. In saying this I do think that there are occasions when unnecessary luxuries are accorded to White children which in view of the priorities facing South Africa we should have to sacrifice for the benefit of the education of other people. This is not to suggest that there should be a lowering of educational standards at all, not by one jot or tittle. However, there are some luxuries which could be omitted for the benefit of everybody and directed to the education of Blacks.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">C. C. HENDERSON</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>There is for instance an urge for new universities for Whites in certain places. I do not believe that the Whites require any more universities in South Africa than already exist. The development of the existing universities, if there are more young men and women who require university training should by all means be encouraged. However, I very much doubt whether under all the circumstances we can in fact justify the establishment of new universities for Whites when there is so much else which requires attention, especially in the field of Black education.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of the same principle I do believe that the hon. the Minister should accept assistance from every direction from which he can obtain it. We are perfectly aware of the fact that his predecessors seemed to take every opportunity of rejecting assistance from outside and sought not only to keep control but to be the only providers of education for Black people. They rejected the missionaries and they rejected White teachers and every possible offer to assist in educating Black people was rejected.</p>
                        <p>I met a very charming young lady the other day who teaches in Soweto. She found great inspiration in teaching Black children in Soweto. She found that they were so keen to learn that this gave her a sense of satisfaction, particularly after having taught White children who, by contrast, were not so well motivated as these Black children. In many cases there is a surplus of White teachers available in South Africa. I believe that the hon. the Minister should accept and encourage every White teacher he possibly can to come and help him in educating the Black children. This is a sphere in which I believe there are substantial untapped resources for the fulfilment of the objectives of this Bill.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of other voluntary organizations which seek to support education for Black people. There are business organizations, there are newspapers, missionaries and organizations of all types which seek to assist in the educational sphere. I am sure with a little encouragement many of the big organizations in South Africa will be very happy to provide some of the 7 000-odd classrooms the hon. the Minister requires in the near future. I am sure that many of these large corporations will be only too happy to assist if they are encouraged and given the opportunity. Therefore, in many spheres, provided the hon. the Minister gives the encouragement, he will find that almost all White organizations will be willing to help to the limit of their resources.</p>
                        <p>I am also very glad to note that the hon. the Minister is prepared to accept and in fact to seek foreign loans. This is a sphere in which again I am sure the hon. the Minister will enjoy a considerable measure of success, obviously with the proviso that our State will guarantee those loans. This is one sphere in fact where we may be able to attract a considerable amount of foreign capital, to the benefit of the economy as a whole. While foreign countries may not be willing to provide their capital in other spheres they may well be willing to provide that capital provided it is specifically directed towards education for Black people. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will do all within his power and with all the means at his disposal to carry the comments from this side of the House to his successor. I do not know when the hon. the Minister will be relinquishing the reins of office in this particular department but no doubt his successor will assume those reins in the near future. It is therefore the responsibility of this hon. Minister to transmit the essential points of this debate to his successor.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in a somewhat different vein, the hon. the Minister referred to his past as a dominee. Well, when one sees some of his colleagues I sometimes wonder whether in fact we are going to become a theocracy. We know that we are supposed to be a democracy whereas in fact we are an autocracy. The danger as I see it, is that we may in fact at times, I am very much afraid, become a kakistocracy.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I did not intend to take part in this debate at all and I do so only for one purpose. I should like to obtain certain information from the hon. the Minister arising out of some interesting remarks that he made. I refer in particular to the question of foreign loans, which I am very grateful for. I support this as much as my colleague the hon. Senator Henderson. I support all his sentiments as regards that point.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Henderson and myself, during the recent recess we had over the past couple of weeks, attended a function in Zululand when Chief Gatsha Buthelezi addressed us. I will say as little about that address as I possibly can and I think the hon. Senator Henderson knows the reason why. But one remark that Chief Buthelezi made was of particular significance in relation to the point that the hon. the Minister has made regarding foreign loans for the purpose of the advancement of Black education. He said that he wished to pay tribute to Great Britain. In particular he addressed his remarks to the British Minister who attended that particular function. He expressed the wish to have his remarks conveyed to the British ambassador. He said that a large sum of money&#x2014;and he did not mention the amount at the time&#x2014;had been granted, not as a loan but as a gift by the British Government to Black education. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will be able to advise us what that was because it is of interest to me and it might be of interest to others as well, in this context of money being provided from overseas for Black education.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I am very pleased to hear of the finance we may possibly be able to obtain abroad and I hope full use will be made of it.</p>
                        <p>I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister to give as much help as possible to church schools at this stage. I think that this might also have a good effect on overseas institutions in granting us loans. I want to refer to the good work which my own church has done in this respect. Along the Olifants River, at the tip of Sekukuniland, I met Dr. Phatudi for the first time when he was being educated at our church school. Later he became a teacher and inspector of schools. I hope that at this stage we will encourage church schools for the very reason that education is so important.</p>
                        <p>I am also pleased to see that the principle of parental option is embodied in this Bill. In view of the fact that the hon. the Minister is now taking over another portfolio, I do not want him to be misled by the hon. Senator G. P. van den Berg. Our argument was in regard to the question of parental option. We should really take another look at White South Africa because I think the hon. Minister will concede that the education system for our Whites is aimed at bringing about one nation in South Africa. We have two official languages and I do not think anybody will argue with that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I hope that this legislation will bring about a change in the attitude shown by President Mangope during their independence celebrations. On that occasion he used harsh words and I have already quoted them in the House. He said, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, that he wanted to put it very clearly that one of the reasons why he had accepted independence for his country was &#x201C;to get away from the hated Bantu education which Pretoria claims is equal but which is not equal&#x201D;. I am pleased to note that the hon. the Minister is having discussions with these people and I hope that this legislation, and also the manner in which this hon. Minister has handled this portfolio, will help to change the attitude of President Mangope in this connection. He is also a product of my own church&#x2019;s school and it is to be regretted that he used those words which apparently were well-founded. I do hope therefore that this legislation will help to bring about a better relationship among all of us because I think that is absolutely necessary. Good human relations are very, very important in South Africa and in my view the hon. the Minister has done his share in promoting them while in charge of this portfolio.

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I should like to express my thanks to the hon. Senator Du Toit, not only for his kind words but also for the suggestions he has made. I should like to reply briefly to his questions. As far as church schools are concerned, I should like in all fairness to leave the matter of further extensions which might be authorized in terms of this Bill, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, the subsidy system and so on, to my successor to deal with. I do not want to bind him in any way to things for which I shall not be responsible.
                        </p>
                        <p>When we talk of church schools, Sir, we must keep certain things in mind. A survey was made among the Black people in the Witbank township because various groups had asked for a site on which to build a church. It is hard to believe but there were 187 religious associations in the Black township of Witbank. When is a church a church and when is it not? The hon. Senator</p>
                        <p>Henderson spoke of theocracy and I am trying to get him to convert and become a Nationalist, although I cannot convert him to other ideas. But it will not help because there are some things no church can succeed in doing.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Crook spoke of the financing of schools in kwaZulu.</p>
                        <p>†It is a fact that not only in kwaZulu but also in the Transkei and Bophuthatswana especially, vast sums of money have been pumped into education by way of grants, free, gratis and for nothing. They do ask the permission of the Department of Plural Relations, but they are allowed to give these grants to the different homeland governments. Of course, we were not always keen on accepting these grants in White South Africa because of the fact that there are always strings attached. People come to us and say: I am prepared to donate R10 million on condition that you will build a school where both Whites and Blacks can attend. In other words, no segregation in schools, no apartheid, or whatever one wants to call it. This is however against the policy of the Government and therefore we could not allow it. This is also in reply to what the hon. Senator Henderson asked. We recently had a case where the American Chamber of Commerce asked for permission to build a school in Soweto. We have gone a long way towards finalizing this matter. There are only a few minor matters to be straightened out. With the sports fields that are envisaged and everything that has been planned, I think this will be something special. But we must at all times realize that not only must there be control over the standard of education, but sometimes also over the finances. We had cases, I regret to say, where people came forward with beautiful ideas, asking permission to give tuition to children free, gratis and for nothing. And at the end of the term one finds that they have been handed a slip of paper stating that they have passed Std. VI, while it was not worth a cent because they could not even pass St. I or grade I for that matter. There are ever so many people, I regret to say, who prey on these innocent people, and we have to stop that type of thing. Therefore schools will have to be registered and will have to be run along the lines laid down by my department.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator made a suggestion in regard to White teachers. Sir, it is such a delicate field when one starts negotiating. The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers will perhaps be able to tell hon. Senators that in Soweto, when we appointed a White principal because he was so well qualified and had a love for the work and was prepared to risk his life to teach in Soweto, there was an outcry against his appointment over a Black. We cannot get away from it There is forever people sowing suspicion, no matter what one does. One can never be right.</p>

                        <p>Yes, there is nothing to stop it from being done. It can be done. We still have over 300 White teachers teaching in our schools for Blacks, but we are now using more and more White teachers for the upgrading of the qualification of teachers. I think that is where it is needed most, and we are looking forward to getting more of this type of assistance later. I agree fully that sometimes we have to accept outside help. In this regard the Urban Foundation and the Teach Fund have been of considerable assistance. To hon. Senators in Natal I can mention that they have an organization there called &#x201C;Operation Upgrade&#x201D;, which is run by a Mr. D&#x2019;Oliviera. Unfortunately, I believe that his wife is suffering from an incurable disease and is dying. But despite this fact, this missionary comes over from America for six months of the year to work among adult Blacks in South Africa and to at least teach them literacy. We get this type of assistance and, in turn, we give assistance where we can. I can say without fear of contradiction that there is a great deal of interest in the field of education.</p>
                        <p>I am very pleased that we have my senior colleague here, the hon. the Minister of Finance. He has been ever so kind to my Department and I have no doubt that he will continue to be so in future.</p>

                        <p>Section 21(1) of the Financial Relations Act, 1976, empowers a provincial council to make provision, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, for the payment from the provincial revenue fund of an amount required for the defraying of expenditure incurred within the province in connection with a matter of national interest.

                        <p>Section 21(2) of the Act defines a matter of national interest as any act, event, granting of aid, ceremony or demonstration declared by the Minister of the Interior and Immigration to be a matter of national interest on the ground that it is calculated,

                        </p>
                        <p>As hon. Senators know, 1979 has been proclaimed to be Health Year. The provinces play a prominent part in the provision of health services and will of necessity therefore incur direct expenditure in some way or other in connection with the project. Since the provinces do not have the power to incur expenditure in relation to a matter such as a Health Year, a request has been made that the project be declared a matter of national interest in terms of section 21. However, the State law advisers are of the opinion that Health Year, 1979, cannot be included under any of the matters specified in section 21(2).</p>
                        <p>In order to vest the Minister of the Interior and Immigration with the necessary power to declare such an important project to be a matter of national interest it is being proposed in the Bill that the word &#x201C;health&#x201D; be inserted after the words &#x201C;physical or human sciences&#x201D; in the said section 21(2). It may be accepted that the provinces have already taken steps in regard to the matter, and consequently it is also being proposed that the statutory amendments shall be with retrospective effect.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President I want to assure the hon. the Deputy Minister that if he always comes to this Upper House with legislation that is of such an innocuous nature he will never experience any difficulty with it. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows that we on these benches subscribe to the principle of the decentralization of power and this Bill provides for a certain amount of decentralization of power to the provincial councils. Therefore we approve of the legislation in principle and it will consequently not be necessary for the hon. the Deputy Minister to devote a great deal of time to piloting this legislation through the House.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I am in full agreement with the hon. Senator Horak as far as this legislation is concerned.

I want to say, however, that the central Government is making a very valuable contribution, especially in the Transvaal. I do hope, however, that seeing that we on the borders of the Transvaal are protecting the people on the other side of the Liesbeek River &#x2026;</p>

I am sure the hon. the Minister of Finance has a great deal of money that he can make available to the Transvaal so he can make an adequate amount available for these two projects, namely the Health Year and national security.

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, had the hon. Senator Du Toit not spoken, I could have replied very briefly. I want firstly to tell hon. Senators that I am very pleased that they support such a positive measure as this. We all agree that the provinces are the bodies that play a decisive role today in providing health services and that we would be making a serious mistake if we did not see to it that they had the necessary means at their disposal to play their rightful part in promoting the Health Year 1979. However, I want to tell the hon. Senator Du Toit immediately that that does not mean that the State is going to provide the provinces with money for this purpose. On the contrary. This legislation provides that the provinces are to be allowed to use money from the Provincial Revenue Fund in order to participate in the Health Year. Because most of the funds of the provinces are supplied by the Treasury, it is necessary for the Treasury and the State has to lay down certain guidelines in regard to how the money is to be spent. The Government law adviser informs us that in terms of the Financial Relations Act the provinces will not be able to spend money from those funds for this purpose. The Act has first to be amended and provision has to be made enabling them to spend money for that purpose. All I am asking here is that the provinces be allowed to use some of their own money in order to participate in this project.</p>

                        <p>Here is another Senator from the Cape Province talking. He knows nothing about what is happening beyond the Liesbeek. This is not a matter of provincialism but if certain services have already been budgeted for, some of the amounts allocated will most probably have to be pruned in order to contribute money for the Health Year. Naturally the provinces are making a very, very valuable contribution but this may cause difficulty. That is why I ask in anticipation of that happening whether the hon. the Deputy Minister could use his influence so that they will receive a little extra.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I want to tell the hon. Senator Du Toit that preparations for this Health Year started last year. The provinces knew of this a long time ago; they planned for it and in fact they budgeted for it. They have made ample provision for it so that they can play their rightful part. When the matter was raised at the beginning of the year it was doubtful whether they could, within the framework of existing legislation, utilize the money they had earmarked in their budgets for that purpose. The matter was referred to the Government law adviser and it was recommended that the whole matter be placed beyond any doubt. I can assure the hon. Senator that it will not be necessary for the provinces to change their budgets at this stage. As a matter of fact they have already spent the money they have voted for this purpose. What we are doing in fact is to legalize what the provinces have done with retrospective effect.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>I trust that you will allow me to make a few introductory remarks before I proceed to deal with the Bill.</p>
                        <p>The present Industrial Conciliation Act still contains, in broad outline, the principles laid down in the Conciliation Act of 1924, with important changes, of course, which have been made at various stages. One can proudly state, therefore, that this Act, as well as our other labour legislation up to now, has functioned very well indeed and has made a major contribution to the industrial peace we have enjoyed over the years. As hon. Senators know, the Conciliation Act regulates the registration of trade unions, employers&#x2019; organizations and industrial councils. It also regulates the activities of the existing industrial tribunal and the settling of industrial disputes. It also contains provisions relating to freedom of association and the protection workers are afforded by job reservation.</p>
                        <p>The most important part of the Act, i.e. the registration of trade unions, is not applicable to Blacks. Consequently a dual system is in operation. A separate mechanism has been created for Blacks as far as the negotiation of conditions of service is concerned, namely the Black Labour Relations Regulation Act. Therefore we have the co-existence, in one economic framework, of an industrial council system for Whites and coloured persons, the success of which has been proved over the years by the responsible conduct of the 174 trade unions and 243 employers&#x2019; organizations, as well as the 2 552 liaison and 305 works committees on the entrepreneurial level for Blacks.</p>
                        <p>Of course, there is also a third system of wage regulation, the wage board system, in terms of which a statutory body makes recommendations concerning conditions of service with regard to all population groups.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, changes have been made to our labour legislation but events and developments in all fields and in the field of labour in particular, have been rapid over the past two decades. South Africa could not and has not escaped this. Shortly after I became Minister of Labour, I realized that matters in the labour field were developing in a direction which justified action. Evidence which reached me along various channels indicated that events, internal as well as external, in the political and economic spheres, had been of such a drastic and dramatic nature that the Government could not wait until evolutionary changes were forced upon it. I sensed that the time for reactive conduct was past and that we would henceforth have to take preventive action or we would lose the initiative with regard to timely and essential changes and adjustments to our system and to the legislation.</p>
                        <p>I had the feeling that I should prepare a comprehensive account and make an in-depth analysis of the developments as soon as possible for myself and for the country, so that the Government would be able to keep its finger on the pulse of the country&#x2019;s labour dispensation.</p>
                        <p>To confirm my suppositions, I recommended in June 1977 that a commission of inquiry be appointed with the widest possible terms of reference, not only to examine all the laws administered by the Department of Labour but also to analyse the whole labour set-up in its widest context to ascertain what the factual situation was and to make recommendations concerning the changes that should be made.</p>
                        <p>The total statutory and institutional dispensation which is envisaged by the commission, the essential features of which have been accepted by the Government, will of necessity require a considerable time for its full implementation. Patient construction is required, and the provision of the necessary statutory provisions is only one aspect of it Consequently, the Government has seen fit to make only a few amendments to the existing Industrial Conciliation Act for the time being, so as not to delay essential changes. The Bill which is now before the House gives effect to this approach. I have tabled an explanatory memorandum and I should now like to explain in greater detail the most important proposed amendments.</p>
                        <p>Clause 1 contains several new definitions, and the most important of these is the new definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D;. As hon. Senators know, Black workers are presently excluded from the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D;. Legally speaking, therefore, they cannot be organized into registered trade unions and cannot have representation on industrial councils. The negotiating procedures of industrial councils are barred to them and they can only make use of the &#x201C;committee system&#x201D; under the Black Labour Relations Regulation Act and can only negotiate in general terms with regard to a specific enterprise. In practice, however, several sections of the existing Industrial Conciliation Act have been applied to Blacks since 1924. In this way, most industrial council agreements laying down wages and other conditions of service are extended to the Blacks to prevent unfair competition.</p>
                        <p>The Government has decided that only certain workers will be admitted to trade unions. Consequently the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; is being amended to provide for this. Only persons who have the right to reside permanently in South Africa and who have permanent jobs are regarded as employees for the purposes of the Act. Migrant labourers and border commuters are excluded. I have already given a definition of such workers in the explanatory memorandum. I should like to draw hon. Senators&#x2019; attention to the fact that I do have the power to declare any person to be an employee for the purposes of the Act, and I have already received representations from organizations which foresee problems in certain areas. Therefore I am well aware of the fact that there are quite a number of problems in this connection, problems which will have to be sorted out It is also clear to me that certain commuters will have to be accommodated. I therefore intend to have the matter investigated at once and to make changes in this connection in due course. As you know, I have publicly expressed the opinion that I shall have to make concessions to accommodate commuters in certain areas and industries in terms of the powers conferred upon me by the legislation under discussion.</p>
                        <p>I do want to point out, though, that the large numbers of commuters and migrant workers from homelands and independent Black States are not completely without protection. They can still make use of the committee system in terms of the Black Labour Relations Regulation Act, as they have in the past. Furthermore, I want to point out that industrial council agreements laying down wages and other conditions of service, such as hours of work, leave, sick-leave, etc., have in the past been extended to cover all workers, including commuters and migrant workers, and this will also be the case in the future. After all, we shall not lay down separate wages for such workers. If we did that, we would have chaos on the shop floors.</p>
                        <p>Another matter I want to make quite clear is that farm labourers and domestic servants have been excluded from the Conciliation Act and other industrial laws since 1924. Only in 1965 did we include farm labourers under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. In previous reports, the commissions concerned argued that it would be extremely difficult to make industrial legislation applicable to farm labourers and domestic servants because circumstances differ from farm to farm and from province to province. However, I do not want to say any more about this matter because the Wiehahn Commission still has to report on it.</p>
                        <p>I should now like to deal with clause 2. It concerns the proposed National Manpower Commission. The commission&#x2014;I am now referring to the present commission&#x2014;refers to the development, in the economic and social spheres in particular, which is making increasing demands of the State. This development is taking place at such a rapid pace these days that labour policy and possible legislation will have to be reviewed at shorter intervals. The role of the State with regard to future planning, rationalization and development of manpower to fit into the economic pattern is becoming increasingly important. The internationalization of labour, especially in the context of the Southern African dispensation, will increasingly involve me as Minister and my department in the international labour world. The recruitment, development and utilization of manpower from outside our borders is assuming ever greater significance and must certainly be connected with internal unemployment and the creation of job opportunities on a priority basis. As Senators know, more and more people are advocating better utilization of local labour in certain sectors of the economic system.</p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Ad hoc</i> commissions, such as the Naudé Commission, which were appointed in the past, will in my opinion no longer fit into the future planning and will not be the proper method of identifying tendencies. A standing body which will have to review the whole labour set-up on an on-going basis, and which will watch developments and tendencies so that adjustments may be made in time, is essential.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Government is thoroughly aware of the structural changes in the country&#x2019;s economy, technological developments and political events in and around our country&#x2019;s borders. In the light of this, vigilance, purposeful preparedness and greater flexibility will be required in policy formulation, in planning and in conduct. The labour set-up and developments will have to be continually monitored and tested. We simply cannot allow our policy and legislation to lag behind practical developments any longer. We have only to look at the growth in the economically active population and its composition to identify the rapidly changing pattern.</p>
                        <p>In 1960, the economically active population consisted of 1,1 million Whites, 551 000 Coloureds, 125 000 Asians and 4,3 million Blacks. In 1978, the figures were: 1,8 million Whites, 836 000 Coloureds, 244 000 Asians and 6,3 million Blacks. In the case of the Whites, therefore, there was a growth of 700 000; in the case of the Coloureds it was 285 000; in the case of the Asians, 119 000; and in the case of the Blacks, 2 million; a total increase of 3 million over this short period.</p>
                        <p>According to the latest manpower survey of the Department of Labour in 1977 at a time of economic depression&#x2014;and we should bear in mind that this was during a period of low conjuncture, a time of serious recession&#x2014;there were already considerable labour shortages in certain sectors. The point I want to make is that if we had shortages during a recession, how much greater would those shortages not be when we moved out of the recession into a renewed upswing. Even then there was a shortage of more than 12 000 Whites in the professional occupations, more than 4 000 in the clerical occupations, more than 8 000 in transport and communications and more than 9 000 artisans. It is expected that these shortages will grow if we have an economic revival, and therefore it is of the utmost importance that we should have a standing body which is able to review our labour requirements on a regular basis. Therefore the Government accepts the commission&#x2019;s recommendation for the establishment of a National Manpower Commission which will have to give the Government well-researched and well-motivated advice on an on-going basis so that quick and effective action may be taken to meet our labour requirements if there is an economic revival. In the light of its composition, which includes representatives of employers and employees, the National Manpower Commission will naturally play an important role in the implementation of the recommendations of the commission which are accepted by the Government. I believe that there will have to be the closest possible liaison between the National Manpower Commission and the present commission so that the fullest co-operation between organized employers&#x2019; and employees&#x2019; organizations may be ensured. The objective is to give a say to a diversity of persons and bodies. Because it will not be possible initially to give all interested groups representation on the National Manpower Commission, I intend to designate additional members for specific tasks and problems which may arise.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I want to point out that the National Manpower Commission will maintain the closest co-operation with all Government departments. The research function of the National Manpower Commission will be on a different level from that of the Human Sciences Research Council and of universities. Its research will be more practical and orientated towards the process of policy formulation. Therefore the National Manpower Commission will actually be supplementary to the activities of other bodies which concentrate more specifically on particular research projects. I am convinced that the National Manpower Commission will be a body on whose shoulders a great national responsibility will rest. I trust that all parties will make contributions when consultations are held about specific problems and hitches, not only by way of isolated memoranda, but continuously.</p>
                        <p>Clause 3 of the Bill deals mainly with the registration of trade unions. As I have already said, Black workers are presently excluded from the Act For this reason, Black trade unions cannot legally register and therefore cannot have representation on industrial councils. Therefore they do not form part of the bargaining process on that level. There has been intense overseas interest lately in our trade unionism, especially with regard to Black workers. This process is taking place by means of foreign pressure groups as well as certain labour codes drawn up by overseas countries for subsidiary companies in South Africa. The existing 27 Black trade unions and their approximately 50 000 members, which are not statutorily prohibited, already exist in some key industries and receive considerable financial and moral support from overseas. These Black trade unions exist alongside the three statutory systems, i.e. the industrial council system, the committee system and the wage board system, so they can enter into agreements outside these systems with individual employers on an entrepreneurial level, thereby subverting the existing systems. This system enjoys strong foreign support. The international trade union movement already has training centres in some of our neighbouring States for training Blacks as trade union leaders. Many South African Black trade union members are being trained abroad and many overseas trade union leaders have been visiting the Republic in recent years to observe and promote trade union activities in this country and to provide organizational assistance. Over the past 18 months, more than 60 people have visited the Republic from the United States, Holland, Sweden, Italy and Britain. South African Blacks have visited countries such as the United States, Britain and Holland to make a study of trade unionism and to obtain contacts so that the local trade unions may affiliate with the overseas unions. These Blacks from South Africa have been financed mainly by foreign bodies.</p>
                        <p>The existing Black trade unions are not at the moment subject to any legal requirements and therefore find themselves in a more favourable position than the registered trade unions, one reason being that there is no control over their money and it can therefore be used as they see fit, and is of course often channelled in directions which have nothing to do with conditions of service, which is the primary concern of trade unionism.</p>
                        <p>The extension of statutory trade union rights to Black workers can therefore have far-reaching implications for this country, and in accepting the commission&#x2019;s recommendations on this point, the Government does not intend to open up the system altogether from the start. For this reason, the Government has not fully accepted either the majority or the minority standpoint of the commission, but has decided that in the future, only workers of all races who have permanent jobs and who are permanently resident in this country will qualify for trade union membership. I want to emphasize that this restriction will apply to all population groups. The reason why the distinction cannot be made on any other basis is that other criteria, such as nationality, level of occupation, industrial orientation, etc., are creating many problems elsewhere in the world. The basis of permanent residence and permanent employment is relatively speaking the fairest one for the South African dispensation at the present time and against the background of the political and constitutional developments to come. However, I want to emphasize that the proposed amendment empowers the Minister to bring within the ambit of the legislation, by means of a notice in the 
                            <i>Gazette</i>, certain groups of workers that are not initially entitled to automatic trade union membership. This will be done with due regard for all the relevant interests of all the parties and also with regard to security and the maintenance of industrial peace in this country.
                        </p>
                        <p>It must be accepted that workers who come from a country with an alien ideology will naturally be treated differently or be admitted on other and stricter conditions than those from a friendly country. I will certainly not allow our trade union movement to be abused or used for purposes which may endanger the county. In the light of our geographic situation and constitutional dispensation, there may be independent States, or such States may come into being, which will not allow their citizens to be members of South African trade unions in any case, of which we have already had indications.</p>
                        <p>In clause 4, provision is made for the principle of provisional registration of employers&#x2019; organizations and trade unions, which is an important provision. The principle of provisional registration is not unusual. Even a country such as England subscribes to such a system. Provisional registration will enable the industrial registrar to prescribe conditions and a period of time before an employers&#x2019; organization or a trade union can obtain final registration. As against this, provisional registration will confer a higher status and recognition upon the employers&#x2019; organization or trade union concerned, which will facilitate the recruitment of members, and will also promote attempts to obtain the co-operation of employers in such a campaign. The Government accepts the commission&#x2019;s recommendation that provisional registration should be a prerequisite before a trade union or employers&#x2019; organization can begin a recruitment campaign. The Government is counting on the co-operation of all parties in this connection. To ensure order and to avoid administrative problems, the registration of persons who do not qualify for trade union membership is prohibited.</p>
                        <p>In clause 6, provision is made for the extension of the prohibition on participation by employers&#x2019; organizations and trade unions in political activities and the support of political parties and candidates. The Government is only too aware of the dangers which possible participation by labour organizations in politics may hold for the country. There are many examples elsewhere in the world of situations where pressure groups have developed and impeded economic stability. The Republic is too vulnerable today to allow an intermingling of labour relations and politics. Therefore the prohibition in this connection is being extended by including all bodies established as legislative bodies in the future.</p>
                        <p>Clause 8 provides for the establishment of an industrial court, consisting of a president, who will be a senior jurist The Government believes that a person with the qualifications and experience required by the clause will greatly enhance the status of the court</p>
                        <p>The Government expects great things of the new industrial court as a body which will see that justice is done in labour disputes and which will serve as an important protective mechanism for individual workers in cases where their security is threatened in an illegitimate way. From its administration of justice, a so-called fair and equitable labour code should develop as soon as possible to serve as a guideline for the country. Therefore the Government foresees that the court procedure should be fairly informal and simple; that litigation costs should be kept down; that the court should be as accessible as possible to everyone; and that the rulings of the court should be on the basis of fairness, taking into consideration the socio-economic and socio-political implications of the matters that are submitted to it.</p>
                        <p>The provisions which authorize the president of the court to appoint assessors, after consultation with the employer and employee parties involved in a specific dispute, will ensure that all aspects of disputes will be assessed in a competent and equitable way. It is not necessary to motivate this any further. It is obvious from the fact that the use of assessors is a well-known and established practice in our courts.</p>
                        <p>The judicial function is of a civil nature and covers a wide spectrum of the normal functions of our civil courts. At this stage, the court is not given any criminal jurisdiction, since the proposed informal procedure of the court is not suited to criminal cases and our criminal law sets exacting requirements with regard to criminal liability.</p>
                        <p>Clauses 10 and 11 are intended to incorporate certain protective measures in respect of rights of minority groups on an industrial council. It may happen that a particular party may outnumber some other party on the industrial council. The Government cannot be indifferent to such a possibility, because the maintenance of industrial peace remains a top priority to the Government. Over the years, industrial councils have acted responsibly, and I cannot imagine that they will fail to do so in the future. Nor can I imagine that the industrial councils would act wilfully and refuse to allow responsible parties. The amendment is not aimed at certain races, but at all races.</p>
                        <p>Clause 10 provides, therefore, that before any new parties are admitted to an industrial council in the future, all the parties will have to give their written consent. However, in the Other Place I accepted an amendment in terms of which an aggrieved party will have a right of appeal to the Industrial Court if he is not admitted. Where disputes arise about the changing of labour practices, the industrial councils will also have to be unanimous in their decisions before such changes are effected. If no unanimity exists the matter will have to be referred to the Industrial Court. This amendment is contained in clause 11. The principle of a veto in decisionmaking bodies of a heterogeneous composition is not unknown. Until such time as the new dispensation has been established, it will be necessary to incorporate protective measures at various levels in the new system in order to ensure that the interests of minority groups on the industrial level are properly entrenched. I trust that future development will be so orderly and evolutionary that it will seldom be necessary to use the veto.</p>
                        <p>Clauses 13 and 14 are actually connected with the repeal of section 77 of the existing Act, i.e. the present job reservation provisions. Section 43 of the present Act provides, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, that a worker may appeal to the Minister to intervene where an employer changes his conditions of employment or suspends or terminates his employment. If the Minister decides to intervene, he may order the employer not to change the worker&#x2019;s conditions of service or terminate his services or suspend him. This provision is now being extended so that the Minister will also be able to act where, for example, employers change traditional labour practices and replace or dismiss workers without the matter having been considered by the industrial councils or agreement having been reached between the parties concerning a labour practice. Where industrial councils exist, such disputes will first have to be considered by the industrial council, and if the council cannot settle the dispute, it will have to be referred to the industrial court, and this court will then have to give a final ruling. If the court supports the workers, it will have to make a final determination, which will then prohibit the employer from changing the conditions of service.
                        </p>
                        <p>I should like to appeal to our employers today not to exploit the new dispensation. I trust that changes in established labour practices, if these are essential, will be brought about in an orderly manner and with the co-operation of all the parties, and that it will not be necessary for me to give effect to the statutory protective measures which are now being incorporated in the legislation.</p>
                        <p>As I have already said, the Government does not wish at this stage to implement all the amendments arising from the Wiehahn report, but it first wants to evaluate the development of the new dispensation after the initial amendments, and also to consider what further statutory amendments may be called for.</p>
                        <p>South Africa is indeed on the eve of a new dispensation in its labour history&#x2014;a dispensation in its dispensation in its labour history&#x2014;a dispensation which, if it is regulated with wisdom and insight by the authorities, if it is anticipated in a spirit of co-operation by all parties in the field of industrial relations, holds great promise for the future. As I mentioned briefly, these changes are absolutely essential in the times in which we live. A country which is not prepared to provide for effective mobility in accordance with the requirements of the times is running the danger, in its rigidity, of losing the things to which it clings so desperately. Our survival requires initiative and movement&#x2014;our growth and development require faith and confidence. Therefore we must tackle with both hands the challenges which the future holds. For these reasons, I trust that this amending legislation will be supported by the whole House.</p>

                    <speech by="#scheepers">
                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, at this stage I should like to ask the privilege of the hour, although I shall perhaps not make full use of it.</p>
                        <p>I am very pleased with the explanation the hon. the Minister has given us. The hon. the Minister is correct to a large extent, viz. that many of the principles contained in the 1924 legislation were taken over in the 1937 legislation and again in the 1956 legislation. The Bill now before the House also contains many of the original provisions. It is to be regretted, but at the time our country was not so developed. It took the 1922 strike to bring the Government to its senses and the Industrial Conciliation Act was introduced. This is an Act of which we have always been very proud and which has really contributed greatly to the elimination of strikes and trouble. Furthermore, it is one of the laws that has done much to bring about good labour relations. The period of Hoggenheimer and the oppressed worker was past and as time went on, the workers and employers acted together so that both sectors played a very important role in the economy. Everybody put the economy of the counter first.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the prohibition in the 1924 and successive legislation was to the detriment of Black labour relations and in my view it was specifically because of this prohibition that employees and employers could not freely take decisions for themselves. I think in the period we are now entering we shall have to realize that people must be given more freedom to decide for themselves so that better relations can be built up. I shall deal later with the disadvantages of the legal prohibition that has been placed on certain people.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister has explained what further opportunities there are for the settlement of disputes. We know that the Wage Board has done very important work in this connection, especially among unorganized groups, and it is continuing to do this. The only problem as far as the Wage Board is concerned is that they cannot act quickly enough, and I think this can be ascribed to the fact that they are overloaded with work They do not have the necessary staff and they cannot arrange to do all the work at once, with the result that some of the Wage Board determinations are very old. This period has been reduced. There were times when some of them were 15 years old. The period has gradually decreased although there are still some of these determinations which are seven years old and more. Under the present circumstances, and in view of the cost of living which they have to contend with, the workers cannot wait too long. In my opinion reviews should take place every three years.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister is quite right when he says that there must be revolutionary adjustments. I think that is the reason why the Wiehahn report was so well received by employers and employees of all races. There have even been favourable comments from overseas about the report because the report recommended that many of the things which caused irritation in the past should be done away with. The report has definitely done something good for South Africa. I shall deal with the disappointing aspects later on in my speech. I shall also deal with the definitions later and with the position of permanent employees. I am very pleased that the hon. the Minister gave the assurance that an investigation would be made into the position of the commuters and migrant labourers. This is one of the utmost importance and I shall deal further with this later in my speech.</p>
                        <p>The committee system has served a good purpose but as I said on a previous occasion in this hon. House, this system has not really been adequate. There were court cases. Agreements were reached between the works committees and the other committees and the employers as well as the liaison committees and the employers. But if the agreements were not implemented the only recourse a worker had was to institute civil action against the employer. The worker was not financially in a position to do this. In future the Industrial Court will play a very important role in this connection.</p>
                        <p>As far as the National Manpower Commission is concerned, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that this is a big step forward. I think it was in 1967 or 1968 that I suggested to Dr. Rautenbach that we had to know what our requirements were. The Government had to appoint a committee consisting of employers and employees to go into the matter and to decide precisely what we needed. Because of the prohibition which operated in the past, our economy was most detrimentally affected and we cannot afford this any longer.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister quoted very important figures in regard to growth in the sphere of labour. Employment in respect of all race groups has increased. But each of us connected with the economy, industry and commerce knows that highly skilled labour is very scarce at present. Although as a small White population we should like to keep everything for ourselves&#x2014;of course, I do not believe in this; I believe that the whole population must share in the economy&#x2014;we must realize that we shall not be able to provide the necessary skilled manpower for all time for the Public Service, the Defence Force and so on. I think only a stupid person&#x2014;to be quite blunt&#x2014;could cherish that sort of idea these days. We shall have to make full use of our labour forces; we must learn that people must be employed on merit and that they must be paid according to the work they do. If the Whites want to work, I think they will always be able to hold their own because they very definitely have a big advantage over the other race groups.</p>
                        <p>I like the composition of this Manpower Commission. The commission will consist of public servants, employees and employers. All important groups will therefore be represented on the commission. I welcome the suggestion that assessors may be appointed. They can advise the commission in regard to the relevant industry which the commission might be dealing with at any specific time because it is impossible for one commission to have knowledge of all the different industries in the country.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister is quite right when he says that the world today is showing greater interest in the worker&#x2019;s position in this country, especially the Black worker, than it did in the past. Many people have also visited this country. Some of my colleagues in the trade union with which I am connected and I, have taken these visitors round, and it has meant a great breakthrough for South Africa. We had one person here in January. He not only took photographs of the factories and the people working there but also of the housing schemes etc. When at a later stage he addressed certain groups in England, Belgium and other countries, they told him he was talking rubbish. He then told them that he could prove everything he said because he had himself taken photographs which he could show them. It made a wonderful impression on those people. I have heard again today from somebody who has come back from overseas that it is unbelievable how the attitude of certain people has changed since they have heard from their own people that things are not what the anti-apartheid movement and others say they are. It is important therefore not only that South African trade union leaders should attend congresses and explain what the true position is but that people should come here from overseas and see for themselves what is going on. Numerous students from various countries have come to me to make inquiries in regard to their theses about South Africa in which the trade union movement has played a very important role. We are not the tiny country we might think we are. We are part of the world. But as long as we do not put our house in order we shall not be able to convince the rest of the world that they should accept it. Labour is one of the most important matters. In the business world we are doing a lot of good for people, but all that good work can be undone by unhealthy labour relations if we carry on as we are at present.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister said there was no control over the finances of these people. The hon. the Minister referred to certain trade unions which went about things in a certain way. They do not follow the acknowledged methods, methods in terms of which some of us try to educate the Black trade unions so that they can act responsibly. As far as the clothing workers&#x2019; trade union is concerned, they have helped to organize the Black workers and today this is the largest Black trade union in South Africa. They act very responsibly and there is regular discussion between ourselves and themselves. They ask us regularly for advice. This is of the utmost importance. People from the former Department of Information used to &#x2019;phone me to ask whether I could arrange to explain matters to them and also address the Black trade union representatives. We were like a shop window because this was a trade union which acted responsibly. But we do know that there are certain persons who played a big role in the 1973 strikes. Those people did not develop locally. They were not organized and developed locally. Nobody helped them. Other people came from outside and helped them with money obtained overseas. The Black Trade union of the clothing industry has never received money from overseas because they know that they can always get help through the existing trade union. Within a short time they were financially independent and they could carry on on their own. In my view that is a very important matter which the Manpower Commission must investigate in order to determine which is the best way to act. I want to put it on record that the healthiest trade union and the healthiest relations will be found where the registered trade union and the Black trade union work together. They must decide how they want to do it. If that happens, we shall see that we shall be able to train very sound Black trade unions here which will act responsibly.</p>
                        <p>As far as nationalities are concerned, I can assure the hon. the Minister that in this connection we have experienced no problems in respect of the Black trade union which has been in existence now for 30 years and has grown into a large trade union. They work together and everybody is told: &#x201C;Look, political opinions are not tolerated in the trade union; this trade union works for the welfare of the workers and tries to improve their living standards.&#x201D; In that way everybody has followed the right line of thought and things have gone smoothly with the result that there are no politics in the trade union. The people who have tried to introduce politics have been thrown out surprisingly quickly. These workers knew what it meant to belong to a trade union, to work with the registered trade union and to be on good terms with them.</p>
                        <p>I am not opposed to preliminary registration. I am totally in favour of preliminary registration. But what is not clear to me, especially since the hon. the Minister has spoken, is how preliminary registration will take place. In the past the workers first had to be organized and they had to be representative before the trade union could obtain registration. Now it seems to be the other way round because the hon. the Minister said they cannot recruit before they have obtained preliminary registration. I find this totally lacking in clarity. Can anybody now say to the Registrar: &#x201C;Mr. Registrar, I want to make application; here is my constitution to organize workers in this or that trade union?&#x201D; I really cannot see how that will work. It will mean absolute chaos because, as we say, every Tom, Dick and Harry will now probably want to organize a trade union. He does not have the support of the workers. He can produce no proof. One does not even know if he will mislead the workers. He will say: &#x201C;I am registered, come to me.&#x201D; There is no committee which takes decisions. The workers in general have not taken a decision that they want a trade union. I hope the hon. the Minister will explain the preliminary registration which is to be effected in this way. I find it something quite foreign to the trade union movement, however. From 1924 the position has always been that one had first to organize the workers. One had to prove that one was representative of that industry, who one&#x2019;s committee members were, what their home addresses were etc., and that one&#x2019;s constitution and finances were all in order before one obtained registration. I want to repeat that I am not opposed to preliminary registration. Perhaps it is necessary for a certain period but it must be done in a proper way and not in the way the hon. the Minister has set it out here. It is something quite foreign to me. It will introduce a totally new principle into industrial legislation.</p>
                        <p>I also welcome the establishment of the Industrial Court. I appreciate the fact that it will be cheap and accessible to all persons. If assessors are appointed, they can receive assistance if they are not 
                            <i>au fait</i> with the technical side of a particular industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>Regarding the protection of industrial groups and the fact that they can go to court if they think they have been unfairly treated, I think this is quite right because we do not think employers should have the right to act recklessly and pay off workers unfairly if they do not have a case against them. I just want to tell the hon. the Minister that at a later stage in my speech I shall speak about the majority on the industrial council and so on.</p>
                        <p>The position is here that one is weakening the council&#x2019;s ability to settle a matter and taking up the time of the court unnecessarily. So many disputes are settled by the industrial council to the satisfaction of all concerned. But to expect that one will always have 100%, is not possible. For that reason I am a great champion of the two-thirds majority. If a two-thirds majority is sufficient in this Upper House to change the Constitution, a decision of the industrial council surely calls for no more than a two-thirds majority. That is why it must be unanimous. It is not always possible to have a 100% unanimous decision. One sometimes finds obstreperous people on a council like this and they refuse to deviate from their standpoint. If a two-thirds majority is called for and is present, then the matter is resolved. If a two-thirds majority votes for the worker with a grievance and the others vote against him, that person still has to go to the Industrial Council for a decision. In my view that is quite unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>As far as the right of veto in the clause concerning the trade unions is concerned, I am very pleased about the amendment that has been effected but I do not really like it. I think here too there should be a two-thirds majority who will decide. This will leave a very bad taste and it looks as if one only wants to play cat and mouse with the Black workers. If there are some hostile trade union members they can keep Black workers off the industrial council for all time. In my opinion that is unfair and in this way we are not doing away with discrimination. I think there should be protection for minority groups. The one group should not be able to outvote the other. One group should not comprise the majority of the employees. In my view that is not a very good thing. Minority groups must be protected.</p>

                        <p>Yes, I believe in the principle of parity.</p>
                        <p>The last point to which the hon. Minister referred is one in connection with efficiency and we trust that everything will contribute to greater efficiency. But I do feel that the hon. the Minister has received representations which indicate that a large number of organizations and people are very disappointed with the legislation that has resulted from the outstanding report of the Wiehahn Commission.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, after the report of the Wiehahn Commission on labour legislation I must say that the draft legislation is a great disappointment to us. The continuous enforcement of the separation of workers in the different race groups will be construed as interference with the freedom of association. In this regard I would like to read to you now, Sir, what the commission has reported, and afterwards what is envisaged in this Bill. This refers to freedom of association, which means the definition of employee as far as membership of a trade union is concerned. The Commission recommends&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">&#x2026; both trade union organizations and individuals should be afforded full freedom of association in that eligible individuals should be free to join any appropriate union of their choice, and that unions should be free to admit to a bar from their ranks any such individuals, whether or not race, colour or sex is a consideration; and that any trade union that meets the requirements for registration in the restructured system should, irrespective of the colour, race or sex of its members, be eligible for registration and full participation in the bargaining and dispute prevention and settlement machinery provided for in a statute common to all.</block>
                        <p>I am 100% in favour of this recommendation of the Commission. I think it is a first-class suggestion. In this way we will be doing away with discrimination and yet we leave the choice to the workers themselves. I am definitely not in favour of people compelling workers to come together if the workers themselves are not in favour of it. I feel it must be left to the workers to decide whether they want a mixed trade union or separate trade unions, provided that if a trade union turns away a group of workers, whether they be Coloured, Indian or Black, that union should not have the right to stand in their way to bargain collectively on the industrial council if they have their own trade union. They have as much right as we have to speak for themselves.</p>
                        <p>In regard to this matter &#x201C;employee&#x201D; in this Bill means&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">(a) any person&#x2014;
                            <br/>(i) who is employed by or working for any employer and receiving or entitled to receive any remuneration, and any other person whatsoever who in any manner assists in the carrying on or conducting of the business of an employer; &#x2026;
                        </block>
                        <p>With that provision I find no fault, but it continues&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">(ii) who may legally reside on land in the Republic of South Africa, but excluding any person who resides on land as contemplated in section 21(1) of the Development Trust and Land Act, 1936 (Act No. 18 of 1936), or any land within a territory which in terms of any other law is a self-governing territory within the Republic of South Africa, as well as any person who enters the Republic for the purpose of carrying out a contract &#x2026;</block>
                        <p>I am not going to quote this definition further because at the moment I am not going to plead for workers who enter the Republic on a contract basis from Mozambique, Botswana, Malawi, Zambia or any of these countries. They have never been part of South Africa. But where the workers come from states which formerly were part of South Africa, I feel we should treat them differently. One could even draw a distinction in respect of the independent states in South Africa, but to leave out the people from self-governing states that are not independent and prevent them from joining trade union movements will, I feel, cause a great deal of trouble and chaos.</p>
                        <p>We know that there are many workers who have permission to work in the Republic but do not have rights under section 10 of the Urban Areas Act. In my view there should be no prohibition as far as these workers are concerned because employers are free to employ them. The Minister is given a discretion, but I feel that if one has that right onee would like to see it provided for by law. One does not want to depend on exemption. The trade union movement has on many occasions tried to get exemption from certain provisions. For instance, a mixed trade union wanted to hold a mixed executive meeting and made four applications for exemption without success. I must however, pay tribute to this hon. Minister because only two years ago we made an application to him in this regard and he granted it.</p>
                        <p>If the hon. the Minister has the right to grant exemption, if he deems it expedient to do so, I feel that there should not be other things to tie him down. Why must there be the provision of &#x201C;depending on the numbers&#x201D;? That should not be taken into consideration. If a trade union which previously consisted only of White workers is now prepared to allow Coloured and Indian workers as members, they should be allowed to take that step. If there is a mixed trade union that is prepared to take in Black workers as members and the Black workers are in favour of joining, they should be allowed to do so. I need not say anything more about the responsible attitude of Black trade unions where they have worked with responsible registered trade unions. I cannot over-emphasize this fact. But by trying to keep the workers apart we may just be causing trouble for ourselves. The close co-operation there is among workers of the various race groups the more benefit there will be for the whole country.</p>
                        <p>According to the figures quoted by the hon. the Minister this afternoon, it is evident that the Black workers in South Africa are vastly in the majority today and we certainly would rather have them as our friends than our enemies. We want them to feel that in the labour field they are not ostracized, that they can work side by side with the members of the other race groups. I know that in the past the Department of Labour tried to have separation among the race groups, and in some cases they succeeded for a while, but the employment of both White and Coloured workers in one industry caused problems because to provide all the separate facilities required became too costly for employers. In my opinion this is a matter that may often be taken to the Industrial Court if we are going to be so strict as to prevent workers working together. I have seen it in the engineering industry, the leather industry, the tobacco industry and the clothing industry; workers can work together. They have mutual respect for one another and they do not interfere in one another&#x2019;s affairs. I think the more we do away with laws which are aimed at separating people, and the more industrial relationships that are fostered, the better it will be for everybody concerned. People choose their friends, and so do the workers. Workers are no different to any of us here; they choose their friends in the same way we do. They invite whom they like to their homes, but when it comes to the workplace they are friendly and respect each other. None of us would invite a White hobo to our homes, and neither would a White worker invite a hobo or somebody he does not like to his home.</p>
                        <p>I believe there should be more freedom of choice in this regard. We must do away with bad race relations in this country for the benefit of all. If we wait too long, we shall find ourselves in the same position as poor Rhodesia. We do not want that situation to befall us. We must establish good relations among all race groups in this country. In this respect it is not only the Government which has a responsibility. The more we can establish contact with one another in the trade union movement, in employer organizations and among academics, the better it will be for everybody.</p>
                        <p>There is another matter to which I would like the hon. the Minister to give serious attention. I have talked about the Black trade union in the clothing industry. To a large extent this union followed the example of the established trade union in this industry. Sometimes the two unions acted jointly. Many members of that Black trade union may be commuters and may not fall under section 10 of the Act, but they have been members of that trade union for up to 20 years. They belong to a death benefit fund, which is in actual fact a type of insurance. This scheme is offered by the Homes Trust Company and a worker can cover his whole family in respect of death benefits for a premium of 28 cents per week. This benefit applies to trade union members only. It is a strong fund, with the result that premiums are only revised occasionally. The workers derive wonderfull benefits from this type of insurance. In the event of a still-born child or the death of a child up to six years old, workers receive R75. If both parents work in the industry they get double the amount In the event of the death of a child between the ages of six and fourteen years, a worker gets R150. A child of over 14 is regarded as an adult and in the case of the death of such a child a member receives R500. Where both parents are members, the payout will, of course, be R1 000. Workers have become used to these benefits which they would never have been able to obtain at that price if they had not been members of a group. They would have to pay ten times the amount as individuals for the same insurance cover. As I have said before, workers have paid into this scheme for years. There are also loan and welfare funds to which they have also contributed small amounts which they could afford. We must all realize that workers who earn R25 to R40 per week cannot afford to pay high premiums for anything. But as a group these workers have obtained very good benefits. They also have a medical benefit fund but in this respect they will not be excluded by the legislation as it is controlled by the industrial council. But as far as trade union benefits are concerned they will be the losers. I do not know how their officials will ever be able to explain to them that in terms of Government legislation they can no longer be members of a trade union or of these benefit funds. Mr. President, can you imagine the amount of frustration and despondency among these people when they hear about this? I would not like to be present. It may be that there will not only be frustration but also bitterness and hatred. I hope therefore even at this late stage, if we cannot have this clause amended, that the hon. the Minister, who has the right to grant exemptions, will immediately grant exemption to these people who have been members of these long-established trade unions, so that they can continue to remain members of these trade unions and of the benefit funds. If that is not done I am afraid that these otherwise very peaceful people may become very troublesome people.</p>
                        <p>I want to say that we are very pleased about those workers who are going to have trade union rights. For the first time the discrimination line has been broken and these people will be able to become members of trade unions. But when one considers the large number of workers who are not going to enjoy trade union rights, one begins to have doubts about this legislation. Is the effort worthwhile? The situation will also create administrative problems. For purposes of enrolment as members of trade unions, workers will have to be asked for identification so that the race group to which they belong can be established, and also the country they come from. No one can be a member unless he is registered in terms of section 10. This will cause embarrassment and from an administrative point of view it will be almost impossible to carry out. Added to this is the fact that elsewhere in the Bill provision is made that a person who is guilty of an offence in this respect will be fined R500. In my opinion this fine is out of all proportion.</p>
                        <p>I hope the hon. the Minister will allow the citizens of the Black States to enjoy the same rights as South Africans. Many of these States are not independent, and many of them may perhaps never ask for independence. There is something else which I believe the Manpower Commission can give further consideration to, viz. the question of migrant workers from neighbouring states. But as far as the self-governing territories are concerned which have not yet received their independence, I do not think we have a leg to stand on if we try to exclude their citizens from obtaining trade union membership. When the provisions of this measure become known overseas in the wake of the Wiehahn and other reports we should not be surprised if people over there say that we in South Africa are crooks. They will say that we mislead people with a good report but that when it comes to the crunch we back-pedal. This in itself will be very bad for South Africa&#x2019;s image overseas.</p>
                        <p>As far as commuters are concerned, I believe that only a very small percentage of Black workers who commute to places such as Durban, Rustenburg, Pretoria and Brits will qualify for membership of Black trade unions. We need these Black workers. How can we exclude such vast numbers of these people from becoming trade union members only because they live in Black States that are not independent but are situated almost on the outskirts of these cities and towns? I cannot see how this can be done and how it will work. Furthermore, I feel that it is far better to have control over everybody, rather than to let one section go one way and another section take a different direction. In the first place there will be clashes between these sections. That is definite. Whatever one does, those people are going to be dissatisfied and they are going to organize against the employers, and this may lead to strikes.</p>
                        <p>As far as the finances are concerned, I believe that not only should people have privileges but they should also have responsibilities. I am pleased that provision is made for inspectors to inspect the books. We have always had to submit balance sheets and audited accounts to the industrial registrar whereas the Black unions were not compelled to do so. I can tell you that quite possibly millions of rands disappeared and the workers were left in the lurch because nobody saw to it that the finances were properly administered. Any opportunist could come along and persuade the worker to pay as much as possible and then disappear with the money. That is one of my fears as far as this provisional registration is concerned. There will be plenty of racketeers who will try to take advantage of a situation. We know that people have sold shares, they have sold land, in some cases for millions of rands, and then they have suddenly disappeared. How easy it is for somebody to say: I have been registered; join my union. Then they carry on for a while and then suddenly disappear. We must look after these people because the culprits may never be brought to book. Therefore I feel we must have the closest co-operation possible. The larger the number of responsible people who are represented in trade unions the better it will be for our country.</p>
                        <p>As I have said, I hope the hon. the Minister will use his discretionary powers to grant the present trade union members immediate exemption so they do not lose those benefits they have helped to build up over very many years and which they cannot do without.</p>
                        <p>I repeat that we welcome the Manpower Commission and the directives issued to them. We have no objection to the Minister having the right to terminate the period of office of any person. He may appoint additional members and with that too we are in agreement, as also with the provision enabling the hon. the Minister to fill casual vacancies for any unexpired period and so forth I am particularly in favour of the provision for investigation and research to be done by these people, because I do not think we have had sufficient research, particularly as far as labour requirements are concerned, in this country. We must see where industrial relations can be improved because better industrial relations mean better productivity on the part of the workers. The commission will survey the manpower position from time to time, keep abreast of developments and ensure the effectiveness of labour legislation. For that reason we are not going to oppose this Bill as a whole, but at the Committee Stage we shall vote against certain clauses. However, we shall not oppose the Bill as a whole because there are many advantages contained in this Bill for the workers and the Manpower Commission is definitely one of them. I hope the Manpower Commission will be composed of impartial people and I sincerely hope that there will be no political appointments.</p>

                        <p>I hope that we will have people who will work impartially, as all Government servants should, in accordance with the laws and not in accordance with ideologies. I hope that this commission will work very closely with the industrial councils which represent both employers and employees. If the commission really wants to know what is going on it will find the co-operation of the industrial councils invaluable.</p>
                        <p>When we come to the question of mixed trade unions, I must say that I thought that we had seen the last of separate trade unions, but here in this Bill the Government is still holding on to that idea, should there be insufficient numbers to warrant a separate union. That does not help. One must at least have confidence in the workers to decide for themselves on this issue as to whether they want to be a mixed union or a separate trade union. Under this provision they are again being deprived of their rights; there is no freedom of association whatsoever. The hon. the Minister has quite rightly said that the implementation of this legislation will be studied internationally. This provision will be regarded as continued discrimination, and that is what it is. Give the workers freedom once and for all to decide for themselves. If they have any regrets, they can always decide to break away from one union and establish another for themselves. But give them a chance to see what they want to do and what they consider is in their best interests.</p>

                        <p>I shall not speak about provisional registration as I have already dealt with it. I was very relieved when I saw the amendments submitted in the Other Place regarding the relationship clause. This appears under the proposed new section 4B. However, I am afraid that these amendments do not go far enough and therefore I am completely opposed to clause 4 but I shall deal with this during the Committee Stage.</p>
                        <p>As far as the political prohibition is concerned, I have no objection in this regard. I think we need this clause. Nobody can say this is discriminatory and that it is only now that Blacks are being permitted that we are inserting it. We have had this clause since 1956 and I do not think we have any complaints in regard to it. This applies to everybody equally and we have no objection to it.</p>
                        <p>As far as the Industrial Court is concerned, there is a very healthy development in the draft legislation in connection with this court but I do want to ask the hon. the Minister one question. I agree wholeheartedly with all the matters they are going to handle, but there is one thing which is not completely clear to me in the event of an industrial dispute.</p>
                        <p>We have found on many occasions in the trade union movement that sometimes the workers do not want to take strike action. When one is negotiating regarding a new agreement or in regard to amendments to an existing agreement, a deadlock may be reached and one can go no further. The workers prefer to resort to arbitration to decide their fate instead of resorting to strike action. I had the experience this year where the employers refused to go to arbitration. That leaves the trade union no other alternative but to notify the Minister that when the agreement expires in 30 days&#x2019; time there will be a legal strike. Why should strike action be forced on workers when they are quite prepared to accept the decision of an arbitrator? I cannot find any provision that states clearly what the position is in respect of this question of arbitration. If the workers who are the ones who can cause the greatest disruption decide that they want to go to arbitration it should not be possible for the employers to veto that decision.</p>
                        <p>I welcome the provision which provides for an appeal from the Industrial Court to the Appellate Division. I think that is a sound principle in our industrial legislation.</p>
                        <p>I think I have said enough about the two-thirds majority on the industrial council, except to add that I think a two-thirds majority is a very large majority. I do not think we should give the Industrial Court extra work if industrial councils can settle their disputes by a two-thirds majority.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased about the provision that when a trade union has been refused admission to an industrial council it can now appeal to the Industrial Court within 30 days. I think that is some relief as far as that provision is concerned.</p>
                        <p>I am very pleased that section 77 is being repealed. The hon. the Minister has appealed to the employers and the employers will know in future that the workers will have recourse to the Industrial Court. In this way a cancer has been removed from our legislation and from South Africa, a cancer that has done us great harm.</p>

She did not come here with a prepared lecture on trade unionism and how it should be applied. We know she is an authority on trade unionism&#x2014;a much greater authority than I am.</p>

                        <p>Yes. In the first place, I wish to congratulate the hon. the</p>
                        <p>Minister most heartily on the elevated status he has acquired since he was here last. He has been appointed Leader of the House in the Other Place. The Cabinet is the most closed trade union in the country, Sir. I wish also to congratulate the hon. the Prime Minister 
                            <i>in absentia</i> on the appointment of a new Cabinet Fortunately, it is his prerogative to decide who should serve where. In passing, Sir, I was a member of a deputation that approached Dr. Malan to include Dr. Verwoerd in the Cabinet. The old doctor just looked at us and said: &#x201C;Oh! I thought it was my prerogative to decide whom I want in my Cabinet&#x201D; I do think, however, that we can congratulate the present Prime Minister on the appointment of the new Cabinet and we wish him everything of the best during his régime.
                        </p>
                        <p>The NP has a long record, of course, in connection with labour legislation and the handling of labour matters in this country. Neither do I think we need be ashamed of that record. As a matter of fact, the first NP Government came into power with the assistance of the Labour Party. We had three unilingual English-speaking Labourites in our Cabinet&#x2014;Samson, Boydell and Creswell. Mr. Creswell and I addressed meetings together and Mr. Boydell and I attended physical culture classes together. I found them good teachers, Sir. As a Nationalist I felt very much at home with them and during the war years I as a UP supporter also felt at home with them. Gen. Smuts used to say that he could not win an election unless he had the support of the workers. I am simply sketching the background, Sir. The simple fact of the matter is that the co-operation of the working community of South Africa is essential for the welfare of South Africa, for the prosperity of South Africa and for peace in South Africa.</p>

                        <p>The Government that neglects the working community in South Africa is neglecting itself&#x2014;it is digging its own grave. The record of the NP shows that throughout the years it has satisfied the working community; so much so that today there is no longer any room for a Labour Party in this country. The Labour Party disappeared under the NP Government because the workers were so satisfied.</p>
                        <p>Just look at the position in Vereeniging and its environs, Sir. The member of Parliament for Vanderbijlpark addressed a meeting of the Steel Workers&#x2019; Union as recently as Friday evening at which 14 of their committee members were present. He and Mr. Ballot addressed them and they expressed their unanimous approval of this Bill. That area is the very centre of the workers community in South Africa. During elections we have no trouble at all in the entire Vaal Triangle. The workers vote for us. They vote for us because they have confidence in us. But our policy in respect of the workers of South Africa, just like our policy in respect of all the other problems, is a dynamic and organic policy; it is not a static policy. We are not so stupid as to remain stationary and stagnate. However, if one develops so fast that one outstrips time, one gets unseated as hon. Senators of the Opposition were. They wanted to move faster than time and the electorate were prepared to allow with the result that they are sitting where they are sitting today. One has to keep pace with development Sir; we do not close our eyes to new developments. Under present-day circumstances it is essential that certain changes be effected to our labour structure. This is as a result of developments in the past few years in the international sphere. We cannot live in isolation and the Government and the Minister have realized that. They realized that we would be heading for a dead-end if we did not effect certain adjustments.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. J. H. LOOCK</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Yes, but you acted too soon and you were too clumsy in your handling of the situation. The hon. the Minister has not handled the situation in a clumsy way. He appointed the Wiehahn Commission and the Riekert Commission and he had the matter investigated scientifically. Those reports have not yet been completed. These are only the first of the reports. This is the first legislation that is based on those reports. We are not suggesting that this is perfect legislation but at this stage it is necessary legislation. It can be amended and further legislation can be introduced in future.</p>
                        <p>The fact remains, however, that the hon. the Minister and the Government are not blind to the demands of the times. And the first demand of the times is that we take note of the international labour set-up. Have hon. Senators ever thought what would happen to us if the international labour community were to boycott us? They can paralyse us in one afternoon. They can refuse to allow aeroplanes to land and refuse to off-load our ships. They have the power to do that and we have to co-operate with them. It is no use saying that they are outsiders and that they are inclined towards communism. The practical reality of the situation is that we cannot ignore those people; they are linked with the labour organizations in this country.</p>
                        <p>What has been missing from our labour legislation in the past has been of a twofold nature. There were two major aspects that they used against us. The first was the position of the Black worker and the second was job reservation, that is, the protection the White worker enjoyed and the position of the Black worker. As far as the position of the Black man is concerned he has at no time been prevented from forming a trade union in this country. The hon. Senator Scheepers will remember how Clemens Kandali tried to form a Black trade union. He was reasonably successful but they were never registered. Today there are still 40 unregistered Black trade unions in the country with 80 000 members. The question facing the Government is whether it should allow those trade unions to carry on with their activities in an uncontrolled fashion and to be used as springboards for foreign communist and Marxist propaganda. After all, we know what is happening in England. We know too that one of the basic principles of the communists is to infiltrate trade unions and topple governments in that way. We are not blind to such a situation. Would it not be better for us to have these trade unions registered so that we would know what funds they had, who financed them, who their leaders were and what their aims were, so that we would have them with us and be able to keep an eye on them, and not only keep an eye on them but give them the right which is every ordinary worker&#x2019;s due? That is precisely what the Government is doing now.</p>
                        <p>There may be a difference as to the detailed reason why the Government is doing it but as regards the basic principle of registering Black trade unions, acknowledging them officially and involving them in industrial council decisions, there cannot be any difference of opinion between this side of the House and that side of the House. There may be a difference of opinion as far as the application of the principle is concerned but as far as the principle which the hon. the Minister has now accepted, is concerned, there cannot be any difference of opinion. And that is what we are doing. We must remember that it is absolutely essential for the safety of this country and the prosperity of this country that we satisfy the Black worker as much as possible. I have always thought that in spite of all the moaning, the Republic of South Africa has remained a happy hunting ground for Black workers. The fact that there are nearly one million foreign Black workers in our country, the fact that we still have nearly 100 000 Black workers from Mozambique, which is a Marxist state, working in our mines, &#x2026;</p>

In no other state in Africa is the Black worker treated better than he is treated here. However, we want to treat him well in a controlled manner; we want to treat him well in any organized manner and grant him his trade union rights. What is wrong with that, Sir? They already have that. That is why we and the Opposition agree&#x2014;unless, of course, they want to go much further than we are prepared to go at this stage.</p>

                        <p>We subscribe to the capitalist system. The only guarantee of survival the capitalist system has is that the worker must not be exploited. If we were to exploit the worker in the way he has been exploited in some countries it would mean the end of the capitalist system. That will happen by way of a Marxist revolution. Our strongest weapon against a Marxist revolution in this country is to satisfy the worker.</p>

                        <p>And that is what we are doing. Today the employer&#x2019;s attitude towards the employee is totally different from what it was in the days of the British industrial revolution. In those days the worker was a slave and the employer was his capitalist master. The relationship was that of master towards servant. The days of such a relationship are past, Sir.

                        <p>&#x2026; between the entrepreneur and the employee. That is the tendency throughout the world. That tendency is also developing here. We cannot get away from it We cannot rid ourselves of the Black man. We need him and he needs us. Our State machinery must be geared in such a way that all points of friction are eliminated. The National Party is known for having eliminated points of friction over the years. This legislation paves the way for another adjustment, and not only to satisfy the Black worker and the foreign labour people. It is also essential for the economy and for the peace and security of our country and of the White man himself in this country.</p>
                        <p>The second principle I wish to touch upon is that of protection. All kinds of wild and irresponsible stories are, of course, being spread throughout the country as a result of the Wiehahn Commission; for example, that the White worker will now be oppressed and destroyed because the Black worker will oust him, and that there will be a repetition of the 1922 revolution. But that time is past, Sir. This is not an analogous case. There are other factors which protect the White worker today.</p>

                        <p>Job reservation has been applied in five spheres of employment at most in this country. What is the position in respect of two essential fields, those of the mining and building industries? There is a shortage of skilled labour in the mining industry today not only in South Africa but throughout the continent of Africa&#x2014;as a matter of fact, over the entire world. To be a White mine worker today is the surest guarantee one can have that one will not lose one&#x2019;s job because the whole world needs that White miner. It does not matter which country it is, they are all after our technological knowledge, and our mining technology was developed by the White man. That is his greatest protection.</p>
                        <p>As far as the building industry is concerned, the White man is no longer interested in learning how to make bricks. He no longer wants to do that work. Because of future development and the new cities that will have to be built, we will not have a sufficient number of White technicians and artisans to cope with all the work. Therefore the White man need not be afraid of anything because the Black workers need his expertise and experience.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I wish to start off by congratulating the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers on a most outstanding speech. The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers is known in the labour world in South Africa as being in the forefront of trade union workers and leaders. I would say that there is nobody in this country who has greater knowledge of Black and mixed trade unions than does the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. For that reason she must be a world authority in this particular sphere, because nowhere else in the world do we have this particular situation in existence. The hon. the Minister, I am glad to say, listened most attentively to the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers, and I am sure he has gained very considerable information and assistance from the ideas and the advice she put forward.</p>
                        <p>I agree entirely with the hon. Senator Dr. Loock that the speech of the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers was that of a moderate. She is known as a moderate and I think the speech that she delivered this afternoon can only be described as a moderate speech.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately the hon. the Minister is not here now and I would like him to be present when I address him.</p>

Thus I do not mean to make politics at all at the expense of what has been done in this particular Bill. The hon. the Minister of Finance will probably pass that information on to him.</p>
                        <p>Let me say straightaway, Sir, that we on this side of the House are very disappointed because this Bill has not gone far enough in respect of aspects referred to by the hon.

                        </from>
                        <p>That is the answer&#x2014;the Black workers did not have the vote, and that is why the NP held the attitude on trade union matters and towards the worker of this country that they did. But the hon. Senator Dr. Loock has perceived that the situation has changed dramatically in this country. One admission that he made this afternoon has not, to my knowledge, been made before by an hon. gentleman sitting on those benches. He admitted that we have to take into consideration the international pressures that are upon this country. We have to take the requirements of the international community into consideration. That is common sense, Sir. We have said this over the years, and I am not criticizing the hon. Senator for saying it. I think it takes courage to say it, and I think it will do a lot of good that he has said it But Sir, at the same time I must say that this is a complete departure from what we heard from those benches in the past. What words did they use in the past? &#x201C;Ons sal nie buig nie!&#x201D; On every occasion when the request was made from this side that we should consider international pressures, that we should consider what overseas opinion could say and do to us if we carried on in this stupid way, we were told: &#x201C;Ons sal nie buig nie!&#x201D; Now there is this great change and, Sir, we welcome this change; we welcome even the crumbs that we are receiving. But we would suggest to the hon. the Minister that he continue on the path that he has embarked on at an accelerated pace because it will be to the benefit of South Africa, not only of the Blacks. It will also be to the benefit of our economy and to the benefit of the Whites. Again I give him this undertaking that whenever he introduces legislation in this House that is in line with the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission, in line with the intentions of the NP as expressed in the White Paper, he will receive the full support of this side of the House. Only when he drags his feet, as he unfortunately has done on this occasion in introducing this Bill with the parsimonious concessions that we find in it, will he get criticism from us. As an Opposition it is our duty to criticize and we will continue to do so. But we have criticized in a moderate way, Mr. President, so that under no circumstances will we give comfort to the HNP in the attacks that they are making upon the NP. I feel that the hon. the Minister must realize that he must not continue to look over his right shoulder because we do not have unlimited time in which to bring about the situation that the Wiehahn Commission considers it is necessary for us to bring about in order for us to survive as Whites in the country as it is today and to go forward.</p>
                        <p>There is one further point that was raised by the hon. Senator Dr. Loock that I do think requires an answer. He said that the NP was not prepared to liberalize the trade unions to the extent that the Wiehahn Commission would like to see them liberalized because of the danger of communist infiltration, and he gave the unhappy example of Great Britain. Sir, all of us in this hon. House are fully cognizant of the situation in Britain to which he referred, where the communists have gained a hold on the unions and have the country by the throat by virtue of the fact that they have gained such a hold. That could never happen in this country, because of the Industrial Conciliation Act, the product of the brains of the late Gen. Smuts, which is probably the greatest piece of industrial legislation in the world today. With its checks and balances, as the hon. the Minister knows, it is almost impossible for an industrial situation to arise such as the one which has developed in Britain. It is almost impossible for a legal strike to take place in this country with the machinery which is provided in the Act. That is why we are free of strikes to the extent we are. It is wonderful legislation and I think the hon. the Minister realizes that this is so.</p>
                        <p>On one occasion I heard Minister Marais Steyn say that he had been on a visit to Britain and that he had spoken to some parliamentarians there. I cannot remember whether these parliamentarians were Labour or Conservative party members, or who they were, but I remember clearly that he used words to the effect that they wished they could have this legislation on their Statute Book. I think the actual words of parliamentarian to whom he spoke that he would give his back teeth for this legislation. But the situation in Britain cannot be compared to that in South Africa because the trade unions there have the country by the throat. I am very sorry about that and wish it were not so.</p>
                        <p>Having said what I have, I should like to make a plea to the hon. the Minister. I am not going to cover any of the ground that was covered so adequately and so comprehensively by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers, but there are one or two points I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister for his consideration.</p>
                        <p>The first matter relates to the definition of an employee. This has been discussed by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers, but I want to discuss only one aspect of it which relates to frontier commuters. My plea to the hon. the Minister is to give blanket exemption to frontier commuters of the type to which I want now to refer. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister saw in the Press quite recently that not more than 3% of the Blacks in the greater Durban area will in fact be entitled to join registered trade unions.</p>

                        <p>No, I am sorry. I have not seen the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement, but he can advise us in his reply what the actual position is. My point is that a basic reason why the situation has developed in the greater Durban area is because a large number of workers live in KwaMashu. Until comparatively recently KwaMashu was part of the White area or the so-called common area of South Africa. During the time Minister Koornhof was the competent Minister in the then Department of Bantu Administration and Development, the boundaries of kwaZulu were changed so that KwaMashu fell within kwaZulu. The moment that happened all the people who had previously been residents of so-called White South Africa, overnight became residents of kwaZulu. It was said by cynics that the reason why this was done was to indicate to South Africa and to the world that the homelands policy of the NP was succeeding, because overnight some hundreds of thousands of Blacks fell into kwaZulu and figures could be produced to show that the number of Blacks returning to the homeland had risen dramatically during the period this was done. It is said unkindly&#x2014;by myself among others&#x2014;that this was a sleight of hand, but be that as it may, it resulted in this anomalous situation developing. People who had been resident in White South Africa and were workers of White South Africa would, if this legislation had been introduced before that time, have enjoyed the privileges that are now being granted to Black workers in terms of the Bill, but they are now being deprived of it. This is one of the unsatisfactory aspects of this Bill, viz. that people who historically should enjoy these benefits are now to be denied them because a line was drawn on a map and KwaMashu fell outside the so-called White or common area of South Africa and inside kwaZulu. I therefore plead with the hon. the Minister that a blanket exemption should be given in respect of these people. I think it would be a matter of grave injustice to them if as a result of an administrative action taken just a few years ago they were to lose the rights which they would otherwise have enjoyed. I think an extremely strong case can be made out to the hon. the Minister for him to grant all such workers in kwaZulu a blanket exemption which he can do in terms of the Bill. If the hon. the Minister does not do so, I am afraid that the Government &#x2026;</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>That puts a different complexion on it. I shall deal with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply during the Third Reading debate.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers also referred to several other areas in South Africa, e.g. the Rustenburg area, where there were similar difficulties. But the other significant area in Natal is the Newcastle area. Some 15 years ago it was decided to make Newcastle a growth point. Various reasons were advanced for this decision. Newcastle has the water, it has the land, it is equidistant from two large markets, viz. Durban and Johannesburg, the railway runs through it, it is in the centre of a coal-bearing area, and there are various other reasons. The policy of the Nationalist Government at that time was to establish industries on the border of the so-called Native areas, the homelands, or whatever one might like to call them. The nearest homeland was some 40 miles from Newcastle, viz. Nqutu. If Mohamed cannot go to the mountain, the mountain must come to Mohamed, and this is what happened in this particular case.</p>
                        <p>The Government purchased a large number of farms and created a Bantustan and in doing so it exacerbated the consolidation situation in Natal, but it could nonetheless be said that Newcastle was a border area. This fact has a bearing on this particular Bill because the Blacks that were in that area were in the same position as the KwaMashu Blacks. They had rights, but as soon as this transformation took place, all those Blacks fell within the boundaries of kwaZulu, the same as KwaMashu did, and they have been deprived of their rights.</p>
                        <p>It is not as if there are only a few Blacks who have been affected. I understand that the number of Blacks in Madadene and Mountainview&#x2014;I am informed by my colleague&#x2014;is 230 000. I understand from the police that that is a conservative figure and that in fact it is in excess of that number. The majority of those Blacks as far as I am aware came from Black spots in the north of Natal, from the Charlestown area where there were a tremendous number of Blacks. This area was cleaned out and they were settled there. The Blacks in Newcastle who lived in a so-called location were also forcibly ejected and were settled in Madadene. No doubt the population grew from other sources as well, from Black spots which were in the so-called White areas of South Africa. But the majority of people who came there were&#x2014;there is no doubt about this at all&#x2014;from the White areas of South Africa. So in principle, therefore, they are no different from the people in kwaZulu. They have been deprived of a right which they would have enjoyed under this Bill if this Bill had been introduced 15 years ago. I think the hon. the Minister follows my logic and I think that the hon. the Minister must think of treating them as a special case as well and of granting exemption to them.</p>
                        <p>I have obtained certain figures from the report as to what the position was regarding these Black frontier commuters from kwaZulu, and these refer to the commuters and not just the population. I have figures here of frontier commuters from kwaZulu in 1970 and in 1976. In 1970 the commuters numbered 127 000 and in 1976, after kwaZulu took over KwaMashu and Madadene, the figure rose to 326 000. 326 000 commuters! I should imagine there are 1&#x00BD; million to 1¾ million Blacks who are affected by these changes of boundaries, and I do think that a very strong and fair case can be made out for the hon. the Minister to grant these people blanket exemption. I trust that the hon. the Minister will view this request in the spirit in which it is made. I am thinking, I can assure him, as is the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers, of the good of South Africa, and I am thinking in terms of the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission.</p>
                        <p>Merely to refresh our minds on the attitude adopted by the Wiehahn Commission, I would like to read again a couple of passages from that commission&#x2019;s report which indicate that this matter is a matter of great urgency and not one that can be left over until some time in the future. I implore the hon. the Minister to grasp this nettle and grasp it firmly, and to get a move on with legislation which will put into operation in the shortest possible time all the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission. I repeat that everything he does in that direction will receive the fullest support of members of this side of the House.</p>
                        <p>I refer to page 20 of the report, paragraph 3.36.1. I am reading this out because I think we should once again remember how strong were the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission, a commission which, as the hon. the Minister himself has said, was made up not of politicians but of experts, scientists, including someone I consider one of the best brains in the country on the question of labour legislation, i.e. Prof. Wiehahn himself. That is my view and I think it is the view of the hon. the Minister. What he has said and what he has put into his report is a matter of the greatest importance to us in South Africa. The report states&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">A statutory prohibition forbidding Black workers to form or to join a trade union or to register officially a trade union of their own would not only be contrary to the official policy of moving away from discrimination on racial or colour lines but would also amount to an absolute enforcement of the present discriminatory dualistic system of industrial relations.</block>
                        <p>Those are strong words, Sir, but that is in fact the position we have got to face and I commend these words to the hon. the Minister anew. He should read them again. I may be repeating myself but it is worth repeating. We must proceed with the utmost haste in putting the recommendations into operation. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Such a prohibition would constitute a serious infringement of a worker&#x2019;s freedom of association and thus be in direct conflict with one of the fundamental principles underlying self-governance in a free-enterprise economic system.</block>
                        <p>We have heard about communism. The way to outbid communism is for these people to be brought into these unions, as so ably set out and so ably discussed by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. I want now to read paragraph 3.36.6&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">A prohibition would undoubtedly have the effect of driving Black trade unionism underground and uniting Black workers not only against the authorities but, more important, also against the system of free enterprise in South Africa. It would certainly add fuel to the flames of radicalism on the part of those who wish to overthrow the system.</block>
                        <p>I want to conclude with those words, Sir. I should like at least to thank the hon. the Minister for the crumbs we have received, but once again I ask him to give us more.</p>

Senators have spoken up to now and put their case. But I want to say this to our hon. friends. The most important point they make is that this Bill does not go far enough but our reply to that is that this party goes as far as it thinks desirable in the interests of the country and in the interests of the workers. That applies now and it will also apply in future. There is a secret for success, and I want to repeat it now for the umpteenth time, viz. that one must not do the wrong thing at the wrong time. That is a lesson those friends might well keep in mind.</p>

                        <p>And you have still not learned the lesson! You simply do not learn it. Perhaps sometimes we move slowly, Sir&#x2014;and who will not say that sometimes it is too slowly; that may happen&#x2014;but years ago the head of state in Russia said that it was better to move one step forward at a time and rest on that step than to take two steps forward and fall back three, because then you were further behind than would have been the case if you had gone about things differently. It is the aim of this Government and this Minister to ensure that having taken the steps they do, they can halt and then move forward from there as and when time shows it to be necessary.</p>
                        <p>I should like to commence by expressing my appreciation for something. I know of few Acts, I know of few reports, where the Ministers concerned have gone as far out of their way before taking up a standpoint, introducing legislation and consulting the relevant organizations involved throughout South Africa as was the case with this legislation. I should like to express my appreciation for what the hon. the Minister has done in this connection. He has possibly even been insulted at certain places by people who differ with him, but I have never heard or read that he did not keep cool or that he lost his temper. He is always calm and that is one of the reasons why he is so successful.</p>
                        <p>This hon. the Minister has travelled virtually throughout the country in order to convince employers and employees. In the first place he wanted to get their opinions and in the second place he wanted to tell them what he thought was in the interests of the country. Let me say at once that I know of no Minister who has had a more difficult task in recent years than this Minister, who has had to take such a forward step in regard to something which in the nature of things gives rise to such a difference of opinion among ourselves and among foreigners. I do not take it amiss of people if they differ with us, Sir. Some of the supporters of the NP today differ with the Government&#x2014;in and outside Parliament&#x2014;about certain matters. But a matter like this is like a minefield. Labour relations is one of the most sensitive matters that one has to deal with, particularly in a country like South Africa with its mixed population and with its different standards of development. I say with the greatest sense of responsibility that the hon. Minister finds himself in the position that on the left hand there are people saying: Move quickly; you are going too slowly; you must go further, while on the other side there are people who say: You are going too quickly; you are going too far, we do not agree with you. Can you appreciate the position of the hon. the Minister, Sir? What Government in a matter like this, labour relations, would tackle them holus-bolus? In the interests of his own people, in the interests of South Africa, he dare not do it. He dare not do it, and if he does do it then he is being irresponsible and he must take the consequences.</p>
                        <p>I should like to express my appreciation for the actions of the hon. the Minister. But I should also like to tell him that I do have some sympathy and appreciation for those on our right who do not want to come the whole way with us, those who have reservations about certain matters, those who are concerned about their lot in the future, those who are afraid that their future may be threatened. I appreciate this only too well, Sir, because I know about labour matters, perhaps more about the employers&#x2019; side than the employees&#x2019; side. Perhaps at this stage I should ask the hon. the Minister to continue to have that compassion, that appreciation and that tolerance on the road ahead that he has shown up to now. We must not go too far ahead. I hope the hon. the Minister will always bear this in mind: We must not go too far because then we will be in difficulties. It is in the interests of South Africa that we should take the workers with us. We can never take everybody with us&#x2014;that is impossible. Who would maintain today that we have to take everybody with us? That is impossible. No person can do that; nobody can do it, but we must take the majority of our people with us. If it is necessary to take one step instead of two so that we can take the people along with us, then that is what we must do. We must not be too hasty. We see what is written in the newspapers, Sir, and what is said by trade union leaders in public. With this in mind, I want to say to the hon. the Minister: Make haste slowly, but not so slowly that we are harmed unnecessarily in the process. That is not necessary.

                        <p>It is not our policy to encourage mixed trade unions. I have always said so. If I am wrong, the hon. the Minister can put me right.

We are, of course, in favour of the abolition of discrimination, but the removal of discrimination does not mean integration. That is how I see it. That is why I can support this legislation, because if it were otherwise I would probably have taken up a different viewpoint.</p>

                        <p>There are restrictions on mixed trade unions. Our policy has always been separate trade unions. Hon. Senators complain about free association; they say that there is no free association. I admit that. But now they say there is free association? Why is the hon. Senator so confused? I do not understand the hon. Senator.</p>
                        <p>The other point made by hon. Senators opposite is the position of workers from non-self-governing Black States who cannot become members of trade unions. What is our policy in that connection? I say again that the hon. Minister deals with the situation as it is. At the moment that is the policy. As we go forward, as we learn and as the hon. the Minister sees the situation, changes may occur. I do not say today that there will be no changes. We know that this is an evolutionary measure, and I emphasize the words &#x201C;evolutionary measure&#x201D;, with even greater emphasis on the word &#x201C;evolutionary&#x201D;. We grow as circumstances dictate, as our people can accept it and when it is in the interests of South Africa. But I am opposed, and I take it the party and the Government and the Minister are opposed, to our policy resulting in integration. We are opposed to total mixing; I am totally opposed to it. The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers said: &#x201C;We want to make friends of these people rather than enemies.&#x201D; I agree with her. But that is precisely what this legislation is about, namely to make friends in a responsible way. It does not help to make friends and at the same time to lose them. What would one then achieve? That is what those hon. Senators want. They want us to make friends on the left and lose them on the right. That is not our aim and that we shall not do. We are concerned about those who do not side with us, those who have sided with us up to now. We are going to canvas them; We shall continue to tell them how we see the position for the future. The avenues of communication between us must always be open. We must not mistrust one another; we must trust one another because if we do not trust one another we shall never find one another. If we trust one another, then there is a chance that if we do not agree now eventually we shall agree. I want to ask the trade unions tonight to trust the Minister. This is not a blank cheque.</p>
                        <p>There are certain things one can argue which are far-reaching. There are certain amendments on which I could argue and on which I should also like clarity in certain respects. But there must be a basis of trust because, if one does not have that, where does one find oneself in a case like this? I am acting on the assumption&#x2014;the hon. the Minister can tell me if I am wrong&#x2014;that the object of this legislation is not to throw the White worker to the wolves. That is by no means the intention. And if it is so, then I am opposed to it I am not ashamed to say that I am opposed to it But I do not see it that way, and the hon. the Minister has also said in a public statement that he does not see it that way. That is not the intention and I accept his word. In terms of this legislation the Minister is given a tremendous amount of power. I concede that One could argue in relation to certain clauses that perhaps too much power is being given to the Minister and that perhaps the pressure on him will be so great that he may at times find himself in difficulty. That is the danger there. The success of this legislation will also depend largely on its implementation, as is the case with any legislation. That is also the case with this legislation where the Minister is being given so much power and discretion. He is being given a great deal of power, but we know too that this brings great responsibility with it. A government expects a great sense of responsibility from its Ministers. Should there be a Minister without that great sense of responsibility, we know what will happen. After all, we have experienced this.</p>
                        <p>The legislation does not only protect the White worker, and this I want to stress. I see this as a protection for the non-White as well. In our country we cannot protect one and leave the other unprotected. In the nature of things this is White South Africa but we do have non-Whites among us. We are interdependent in many spheres. We are most closely interdependent in the sphere of economic life. I accept that. We protect the non-Whites and we protect the Whites against the dangers from outside and from inside. I need not mention this to hon. Senators. We know the dangers of the communist world and how they increasingly try to undermine our trade unions to the detriment of the Whites and the Government in South Africa, and not only the Whites but also the responsible non-Whites. A responsible non-White is as little acceptable to communism as a responsible White. We cannot keep them in separate compartments. Certain things we do together on the basis of the NP policy of segregation as far as it is practicable and desirable in the interests of South Africa, and also in the interests of our society as a whole. I stress the words &#x201C;in the interests of our society as a whole.&#x201D; That is an extremely important yardstick. But we do have one proviso, one condition; that is, that it should not affect the future of the White and his survival and not prejudice or destroy it. Is that an unreasonable condition? As I understand the legislation&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister can tell me if I am right&#x2014;there are numerous built-in protective measures, and the White will be no less protected against dangerous exploitation from dangerous employers, if there are such people.</p>

                        <p>That is the basis of this legislation. We are trying to establish a structure so that there can be orderliness in the labour field in South Africa, now and in the future. I do not see this legislation as legislation to disrupt labour peace. Of course, we shall have to be very careful. We shall have to be very careful from what I can deduce from what certain leaders have said in the newspapers and from statements they have made. We shall have to keep a watchful eye on things. The protection of the White workers has not been destroyed. It has not been lost because of the abolition of job reservation. In the first instance the hon. the Minister has said he will continue with the job reservation that exists until such time as he can phase it out by way of agreement and reaching an understanding when everybody is convinced that it is no longer necessary. In any case, only five such job reservations remain. In the second place it concerns the Black trade unions. There are a number of our own people who say: &#x201C;Look at the dangers.&#x201D; If we say today that the establishment of Black trade unions does not contain an element of danger, we are not speaking the truth and we are not being honest. Who can stand up here and say that establishing Black trade unions will not be dangerous? But we say that the present state of affairs is even more dangerous. That is the point. It is not in their interests or in the interests of South Africa. As I see it, our Government and the hon. the Minister are well aware of the dangers connected with this, and that is the reason why the hon. the Minister has taken his time and has gone ahead step by step. I can appreciate why hon. Senators on the other side want him to act more quickly. They want to create a furore so that there will be labour unrest. I can understand that But they are not talking in the interests of South Africa. They are talking in the interests of their own party. The Government and the hon. the Minister are looking to the interests of South Africa.</p>
                        <p>This legislation will also promote labour efficiency. It is also the intention of the legislation to improve labour efficiency, something which is so necessary in South Africa. I am of the opinion that this legislation is within the framework of the policy of the NP. That is how I see it. It will be implemented within the policy of the National Party.</p>

                        <p>We must not be expected to deviate from that policy. But it does not follow that there will not be adjustments. We are not so stupid and silly as not to make adjustments as time dictates. [Interjections.] I want to appeal today, in the political sphere as well, to hon. Senators as I appeal to other parties to the right of the NP&#x2014;we know there are such parties&#x2014;not to make this a big emotional issue. In this respect we really must keep cool heads. If we want to harm South Africa for political gain in the short-term&#x2014;and it can only be in the short-term&#x2014;we can try to exploit the position and incite people who do not have all the facts at their disposal. There is a tremendous responsibility on this hon. Minister and his department to give all the facts and assurances they can to people so that there can be no propaganda against the direction he has taken. It is unnecessary to say that we can only do it and must do it within the framework of our policy of separate development.</p>
                        <p>As far as the amendments are concerned that are proposed by the hon. the Minister in clauses 3 and 4, it is still not quite clear to me what is meant by the provision that a trade union may be established for more than one population group and what the ratio between the numbers of employees of the various population groups must be. I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister will give us more clarity on that point and tell us what it really means and under which circumstances he will use it. I accept that the hon. the Minister will use that power with great discretion. I accept that. I do not believe that it will mean the encouragement of further mixed trade unions or, as he calls them, parallel trade unions.</p>
                        <p>I want to conclude on this note and say that the hon. the Minister has taken a new road. I myself have thought at times that the hon. the Minister has moved too quickly, and I have said this to him too. I make no secret of this. He had difficulty in convincing some of us on all the points. There may be some points on which he has not convinced all of us. As I know him, he will keep his word to employers as well as to employees and he will protect their interests at all times without disregarding the interests of South Africa. Mr. President, if the hon. the Minister does that&#x2014;and I accept that he will do it; I accept that as far as he is able he will protect the interests of the White and the non-White worker at all costs&#x2014;I want to wish him everything of the best because a difficult task confronts him. This is no easy task. He can also rely on us to help him, wherever possible, within the framework of the policy of the NP. As long as he continues to implement that policy carefully and responsibly&#x2014;and he will do that&#x2014;he can rely on us to support and assist him.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, hon. Senators have conducted a very interesting debate today; they have asked numerous questions and I want to thank them most sincerely. I thank them in particular for the way in which they have acted and in this regard I refer to the hon. Senator Crook as well. When I appeared in this House on a previous occasion I was fiercely attacked by him. Today, however, he was fairly reasonable and I thank him for that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, this is not straightforward legislation. Neither is this a straightforward subject. It is something about which one can become very emotional. It is a subject about which one should remain very level-headed because it is a field where we dare not make a mistake. A mistake in regard to evaluation, development, policy, one can almost say timing, in this field can immediately result in something that is counter-productive. However, in future we shall have ample opportunity to discuss this matter thoroughly.</p>
                        <p>As it is already fairly late in the afternoon, Sir, I just want to refer to a few points raised by hon. Senators because I take it that I shall have the opportunity of replying further to the debate on Monday.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers referred to a matter which is of the utmost importance to both the department and the workers. It is a legitimate complaint that has been there for years, namely that the progress we are making by utilizing Wage Board machinery does not keep pace with present-day requirements. In the case of a steady economy with a growth rate of 1% or 2% it is not necessary for one to revise wages every year, only every second or third year. Under present circumstances, however, wages have to be revised more often. Due to the fast rate of development, however, a serious backlog has built up over the past few years. The hon. Senator mentioned something today in respect of which I have heard many complaints in the past, but I heard most of them after matters had already been rectified. We had, namely, given instructions to the Wage Board which had narrowed down its field of activity. In other words, when we instruct the Wage Board to give its attention to wages and a number of other matters, it covers a wide field which takes up a great deal of time. Usually it does not involve secondary matters, only wages themselves. We decided, therefore, to narrow down the instruction to the Wage Board so as to enable it to complete its task more expeditiously. That is what in fact happened and in many respects from the point of view of time the backlog has been reduced to two or three years at the most I personally am satisfied that the position has improved considerably. I can tell the hon. Senator, therefore, that the position is much better than it was in the past. As a matter of fact, my department and I are trying to improve still further a position which is already good. One must never accept something as being good enough. One must always try to improve it still further.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator raised another point which can be an important technical point. I am pleased that she has put the question to me because many people are anxious to know how the Manpower Commission will be constituted. She concluded&#x2014; as it is stated literally there&#x2014;that the commission will be constituted in such a way that employers and employees will be able to submit nominations and that the members will then be elected. That is not really how it will happen. What do we mean when we say: &#x201C;The Minister will consult and ask the opinion of others?&#x201D; Every sensible Minister does that in any case. The officials of this commission will be appointed on a full-time basis as in the case of any permanent commission. When one wants to appoint the chairman or one or two members one does not ask a member of a trade union or employers&#x2019; organization to serve on the permanent sector of the commission. One may want the member to be a labour economist, a highly qualified person, or a labour expert. One would not ask a trade union who that labour economist should be and one would not ask the employers who that person should be. One appoints that type of person as a member.</p>
                        <p>What I personally have in mind is the following: Because the commission will be in continuous session with a permanent staff, I do not think it should be too large. It will probably consist of five or six permanent members, although I may change my mind at a later stage. We must, however, give the trade unions and the employers&#x2019; organizations an opportunity of having a say in the matter. To achieve this I believe we should ask the labour and industrial sectors for contributions and we shall then probably have a comprehensive commission that will function occasionally. In other words, if representatives of the two sectors serve on the commission it will become a large commission. On some occasions these representatives will not serve on the commission, whereas the permanent members of the commission will serve permanently on it. If the hon. Senator means that the trade unions and the employers&#x2019; organizations should have some say, I can assure her that that is my intention. In other words, the trade unions and employers&#x2019; organizations will have full opportunity of making meaningful contributions in the planning and consultations of the commission itself. Everyone will have to be present However, they must not expect me to ask the trade union whom I should appoint as permanent members of the commission because as far as that is concerned they cannot make any contribution.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>That is fine. The hon. Senator also asked me a question in connection with provisional registration. The hon. Senator should clearly understand what we are doing now. She says this is a new development. It is of course something new. We have planned it and we think it will succeed, but it is a new development. In the past a trade union could canvass members and then register as a trade union. They were either accepted or not. I do think, however, that we have now reached a stage&#x2014;the commission has also recommended this&#x2014;where we can introduce a system of provisional registration. When I say &#x201C;provisional&#x201D; I do not at this stage want to tie myself down to a definite period; &#x201C;provisional&#x201D; may mean for a considerable period. What is meant by provisional registration is the following: Before one gives somebody the right to re cruit members and collect fees, the right to enter a certain field, to exercise control and to become a mouthpiece and instrument in the future that will be very powerful, there should be a period within which the Department can give that person an opportunity of proving that he is up to the task. It is also important that the department should be able to determine during that time whether such a person is the type of client to which it wants to give permission. That is why it is essential to have a period of provisional registration. This will also provide protection, because in this field as well, Sir, there was people who take chances. They simply recruit members left and right, collect fees and then they disappear. The bird flies away, the members lose their money and especially their confidence and this causes great misery. In order to obviate this I think a period of provisional registration is the very instrument that we should build into the legislation so that we can keep a watchful eye on the position and lay down certain conditions. The Minister can also say at any time: &#x201C;I do not like you because you do not have the confidence of the people. I do not like your methods.&#x201D; Or otherwise: &#x201C;I am suspicious about something else, and consequently you will not be permanently registered.&#x201D; In other words, we are introducing a preliminary period. Why are we doing it? Mr. President, we are doing it because we are now taking a second step, namely, of conferring trade union rights on Black workers. By saying that I am not suggesting that Black workers are not good workers or that they may abuse trade union rights. I am not casting that reflection because this is going to apply to everybody. But once we have reached the stage where we want to open the door wider, as we are doing now, I do think we are at least entitled to expect the Minister to be doubly careful.

                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>The Road Transportation Act, No. 74 of 1977, contains certain concessions to farmers which mean that that particular transportation is not deemed to constitute road transportation. Consequently application does not have to be made for a road transportation permit. I know it is and has always been the normal practice among the farming community to take their farm labourers to town occasionally in their&#x2014;the farmers&#x2019;&#x2014;own vehicles for the purpose of shopping, or to attend church services, funerals and sports meetings. This is, however, contrary to the provision of Act No. 74 of 1977 because such transportation does constitute road transportation and a road transportation permit is necessary for this purpose. Farmers do, however, have a problem in this regard because public transport is not always readily available for such occasions, and in some cases it does not exist at all.</p>
                        <p>I think hon. Senators will agree with me that the farming community could be accommodated by providing in the Act that the conveyance of farm labourers, when they are conveyed with a farmer&#x2019;s own vehicle between the place where they are being employed in his farming operations and any other place for the purposes of shopping, church attendance, attendance of funerals or any sports or recreational meetings, is not considered to be road transportation. I therefore propose that section 1(2)(b) of Act No. 74 of 1977 be amended by the insertion of paragraph (iiiA).</p>
                        <p>*Mr. President, when I moved the Second Reading of the Road Transportation Bill which has since become the Road Transportation Act, 1977, I said, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, that the human being is fallible and that I did not want to leave the impression that it would never again be necessary to amend the Act. I should have added that the human being is also ingenious and it is because of his ingenuity that I am today compelled to move the amendment of section 1(2)(1).

                        </from>
                        <p>Yes, &#x201C;shrewd&#x201D;.</p>
                        <p>Hon. Senators will remember that section 1(2)(1) was written into the Act as a result of a recommendation by the Commission of Inquiry into the Road Transportation Bill. In paragraph 6.4 of its report the commission felt that a slight concession would solve many of the problems experienced by rural retailers, because as a rule they cannot carry big stocks and have to supplement their stocks frequently. The commission, therefore, recommended the use of a goods vehicle with a carrying capacity not exceeding one thousand kilograms and belonging to a business concern in the course of such a concern&#x2019;s trade to convey its goods anywhere in the country without it being necessary to obtain a permit.</p>
                        <p>Section 1(2)(1) did, however, not limit the use of the vehicles in question to conveyance of own goods in the course of an industry, trade of business with the result that the conventional 1-ton pick-up is designed and built in such a manner that it does not resemble a pick-up in the faintest and those vehicles are then used to run a cartage contracting service for reward without any permits at the cost of established cartage contractors who had to make out a case before a local road transportation board and who had to pay for their permits.</p>
                        <p>Those hauliers who are abusing the concession in respect of the goods vehicle with a carrying capacity not exceeding 1 000 kilograms, and which incidentally includes a trailer, are doing it quite legally by manipulating details such as the carrying capacity of a goods vehicle which can obviously carry more than 1 000 kilograms in such a manner that the vehicle is eventually derated to conform to the requirements of section 1(2)(1).</p>
                        <p>When this matter came to my notice, my first reaction was to delete section 1(2)(1) from Act 74 of 1977. Realizing that the deletion of section 1(2)(1) will be a retrogressive step in the move towards gradual deregulation in the road transportation sphere and bearing in mind that more than 400 vehicles have been specially built by hauliers at a capital cost of approximately R3 million to fall within the 1 000 kilograms carrying capacity range, I instructed the Department of transport to hold discussions with those interested in order to resolve the matter. During the discussions it was agreed that should it be necessary to amend section 1(2)(1), provision should in all fairness be made for a phasing out period during which those hauliers who are using the derated goods vehicles can orientate themselves, either to cease operations with those vehicles or to apply for the necessary road carrier permits. A phasing out period which will lapse on 31 December 1981 was considered to be reasonable.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the present fuel situation, however, I have decided against a phasing out period, the reasons being that any phasing out period may be influenced by the availability of fuel. In this regard it is to be noted that the conveyance of a 10 000 kg payload by a vehicle with that carrying capacity will consume less fuel than ten vehicles with a carrying capacity of 1 000 kg over the same distance. I have consequently decided that the National Transport Commission should be empowered to consider, in its discretion, applications for public permits in respect of those vehicles which have been derated to qualify for the concession as provided for in clause 1(b) of the Bill.</p>
                        <p>In order to ensure uniformity in the exercising of such discretion applications will have to be submitted directly to the National Transport Commission and not to local road transportation boards. I may mention in this regard that the proposed amendment of section 1(2)(1) has been discussed with both the Federation of Road Transport Associations and the Transport Consultative Committee. Those hauliers who make use of the concession are members of either or both of these organizations.</p>
                        <p>Both these bodies, although in favour thereof that a certain measure of control be exercised over the use of these vehicles, expressed concern at the fact that the National Transport Commission would be given the discretion to either grant or refuse authority to those hauliers who have been conveying goods for reward in terms of the section since a date prior to 1 April 1979.</p>
                        <p>Although I am not in a position to anticipate the decision of the National Transport Commission, I can at least give the assurance that the commission will consider each of these cases on its merits whilst all relevant factors will certainly be taken cognizance of. Here I include factors such as the fact that capital investments have been made by certain hauliers as well as the fact that many people have been employed in the course of these operations. Furthermore I wish to point out that these carriers can, in terms of section</p>
                        <p>1(2)(x), continue with their business without having to obtain permits if such conveyance is undertaken within an area within a radius of 40 km from the carrier&#x2019;s place of business.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted from the proposed new paragraph (1A) that the gross vehicle mass as opposed to the carrying capacity in the existing section of the Act is now taken into account to limit goods vehicles to the lighter type, e.g. the well-known &#x00BE;-ton and one-ton pickups. The reason for this is that, as I pointed out earlier, the carrying capacity of a goods vehicle can be manipulated whereas the gross vehicle mass is determined by motor vehicle manufacturers and can, therefore, not be amended at random. By limiting the gross vehicle mass to 2 500 kg, the purpose which was aimed at by the Commission of Inquiry into the Road Transportation Bill is achieved.</p>
                        <p>This amendment is supported not only by the Federation of Road Transport Associations and the Transport Consultative Committee, but also by the Industrial Advisory Committee, who in fact suggested that section 1(2)(1) be amended to exclude trailers and semi-trailers from the concession and to limit the size of goods vehicles by way of gross vehicle mass instead of carrying capacity.</p>
                        <p>*As far as the proposed amendments of section 1(2)(w), 1(2)(x) and 1(2)(y) are concerned, the Minister of Transport may by way of regulation prescribe the manner in which the goods may be conveyed within the areas mentioned. The opinion is held that it is desirable that the Minister should also be empowered to prescribe by regulation conditions with regard to this transport.</p>
                        <p>This opinion stems from a measure of doubt which exists about the legal validity of regulation 2(5) of the Road Transportation Regulations, 1977. It is deemed that this regulation prescribes a condition, and not a manner, while section 1(2)(x) of Act No. 74 of 1977 only mentions the manner prescribed by regulation.</p>
                        <p>Regulation 2(5) was made to restrict those carriers who, through the establishment of bogus depots on the borders of released areas, in reality extended the released areas by 40 km.</p>
                        <p>Should it be decided to make limiting regulations, i.e. the laying down of conditions, in respect of sections 1(2)(w) and 1(2)(y) of Act No. 74 of 1977, the same problem will arise since the sections concerned also mention only the manner prescribed by regulation. In view of this it is necessary for sections 1(2)(w), 1(2)(x) and 1(2)(y) of Act No. 74 of 1977 to be amended in such a manner that the Minister may also make conditions by way of regulation.</p>
                        <p>The conditions to which I am referring, mean that the Minister will be placed in a position, when the said concessions are being abused&#x2014;as is in fact the case with the so-called 1-ton pick-up&#x2014;where he is able to act immediately by amending the regulations where necessary to control the abuse that has been disclosed.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, this is probably the last occasion on which the hon. the Minister will pilot a measure through this House and I would like to take the opportunity of expressing our appreciation for the manner in which he has conducted debates over the years. It has always been a pleasure to conduct a debate with this hon. Minister, even where there was a very strong divergence of opinion. I think he is an example to many other hon. Ministers, an example which they could well follow so that even though there may be a wide divergence of opinion, the acrimony that does take place in the case of certain other hon. Ministers could be avoided.</p>
                        <p>We understand that the hon. the Minister is retiring from the Cabinet and may in fact retire from politics completely. We on this side of the House wish him well. We hope that he and his wife will enjoy a happy, fruitful and long retirement. I am also glad to note that the hon. the Minister will not be coming to this House with a measure which may have disturbed the coolness of debate. I am very glad that he will not be leaving this House with a blemished reputation.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister has clarified the purpose of the amending Bill before the House. As he has indicated, it is remarkable to note the extent to which human ingenuity will go in finding loopholes in the law and in finding solutions to difficult problems. Of course, the solution that has to be found in this country, Sir, is how to solve the problem of getting rid of this Government and finding a better one! No doubt, the ingenuity of our human resources in South Africa will solve that problem too in the not too distant future.</p>

                        <p>As far as the Bill is concerned, it is not necessary for me to go over the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation. But what I am glad to notice is that the amendments are the result of negotiations and discussions with the people concerned. I believe that that is the correct way of solving problems under all circumstances; not to use the big stick and to say &#x201C;You will do this&#x201D; and &#x201C;You will do that&#x201D;, but to negotiate and come to an amicable arrangement whereby a difficulty can be overcome. And that appears to have been the case in this instance.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to note also that the hon. the Minister has given us the assurance that the National Transport Commission, while it is being given the discretion to agree to the granting of permits to those people who are operating the services or to withdraw those permits, will in fact, consider all these cases on their merits, because although these people, through their ingenuity, have found a loophole in the law, their activities have in fact been legal. They have been perfectly legal otherwise strong action would have been taken against them. They have acquired considerable vested interests both in capital expenditure and the employment of labour, and in many cases they in fact render a valuable service. In debates on the Railway budget I had this sort of service in mind when I stated that the Railways were not equipped for the door-to-door type of service which many of these carriers provided. Of course, if the service is from one main railway centre, i.e. from one town which is served by adequate rail transport to another town, then the Railways with their road delivery service probably cater for the service. This type of service also serves many rural areas with which the Railways have no direct contact and one can get service in respect of spare parts or emergency parcels and goods of one kind or another for which the Railways do not provide a service. This new development has only recently taken place and is now noticeable on many roads. In Natal there are certainly daily services of this nature. They do provide a service which despite the increase in the cost of fuel and the shortage of fuel the Railways will in many cases find difficult to replace. I do trust that adequate consideration will be given to all these factors before using the sword of Damocles and cancelling the permits. However, the hon. the Minister has indicated that he has this sort of approach. I trust that his successor in office will also follow the same approach.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I should like to associate myself with the remarks addressed to the hon. the Minister by the hon. Senator Henderson. It seems to me too that today will be last occasion on which the hon. the Minister will introduce Bills on transport matters in this hon. House.</p>
                        <p>It has fallen to my lot to participate in most of his debates in this hon. House. When I look back on the course of the debates, there are two particular facets of his style of debating which have struck me.</p>
                        <p>In the first place the hon. the Minister has always shown his willingness to go into the finest detail in order to convince his opponents. Secondly, I was struck by his technical knowledge, as well as the way in which he prepared himself for the debate so that he could convey the technical details to this hon. House. I remember in particular an occasion where the hon. the Minister was questioned on the noise which certain lorries made at traffic lights. He explained to us how the braking system worked, etc., and why this was the case. I was amazed to learn that day that the hon. the Minister had found time to research the matter so thoroughly and was able to convey it to us so well in this House that we could all understand it.</p>
                        <p>I should like to relate this technical knowledge of the hon. the Minister to his background. He was apprenticed as a lathe operator in the service of the South African Railways. In addition to this training which he received as an apprentice on the Railways, he took an extramural course in mechanical engineering at the Technical College in Cape Town. I have always felt that there was a certain similarity between myself and the hon. the Minister in this respect. I suggest that this background, together with his experience as a jurist, placed him in a particularly favourable position to hold the portfolio of transport, which he has done with such great success since 1974. His retirement now brings to an end an era in the history of</p>
                        <p>Parliament, and I believe that I am speaking on behalf of the whole House when I say that we regard his departure with much regret. In saying farewell to him on this occasion, we would like to wish him and his wife everything of the best for the future.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, the hon. Senator Henderson has indicated that in the light of the arguments advanced and explanations given, the Opposition support the measure before the House. I understood him to say that. He has commended the hon. the Minister for his efforts to negotiate with and consult the people concerned. I also agree with him when he says that he hopes that the National Transport Commission will in fact consider each case that is to be examined in terms of paragraph (2)(1) in the light of their particular merits and that the matters will be dealt with as reasonably as possible. We know too that an amendment has been effected extending the date up to which application may be made in respect of existing carriers. We consider this to be a necessary and desirable amendment.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph (2)(1) was introduced as a result of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into transportation in 1977, principally to provide a measure of concession in respect of rural shopkeepers or dealers because of their need to replenish stocks frequently. Had this concession not been accepted an impossible position would have arisen. This has now apparently been circumvented by the inventiveness of certain people and it has therefore become necessary to amend the Act to prevent this. But in all of this it is evident that we are approaching a new era, we might say the golden era of the Railways because the world energy crisis will now place greater emphasis on the Railways. This is therefore one of the steps among many others that will have to be taken to rationalize the whole national transportation system properly.</p>
                        <p>Sir, with these few words, on behalf of this side of the House I support this Bill.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, as this is quite likely to be the last visit which the hon. the Minister will make to this hon. House in his capacity as Minister of Transport, I should like to agree wholeheartedly with the congratulatory remarks addressed to him by previous speakers. I should like to express my personal appreciation to him for his courtesy and willingness to listen to good arguments in debates in this House.</p>
                        <p>Then, too, I should like to wish him and Mrs. Muller everything of the best for the future. I hope they will be spared for many years to enjoy the good things of life, for instance, red wine and red meat.</p>
                        <p>I should like to deviate today from a procedure I normally follow. It is not often that I thank Ministers in the House, but as far as this legislation is concerned I should like to express my thanks to the hon. the Minister for the concession he has made to the farming community. He has also given a good sketch of the purpose for which this legislation was introduced. I welcome that and I hope the public will realize what the farming community are doing for their workers and their servants. We are in the difficult position that we do not have all the facilities the city dwellers have, for instance, to take a sick person to a doctor or to take people to a larger centre where they can do their shopping. We should therefore like to thank the hon. the Minister sincerely for the concession and if in the past organized agriculture might have spoken harsh words about the Minister, this concession will bring about a change for the better in their attitude, and I am sure that all of them would also like to wish him everything of the best for the future.</p>
                        <p>†As far as the second leg of this Bill is concerned, I would like to support it in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister has obviously consulted all the interested parties, and also in view of the fuel situation in the country.</p>
                        <p>*Once again I should like to wish the hon. the Minister everything of the best for the future.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want to start off by saying that I too will support this legislation. I am not a great lover of the Road Transportation Act, because I believe it is out of place in a free capitalist society. I understand the historical reasons for it and I do not intend, at this late stage, to start a debate across the floor in regard to the Act itself. Nevertheless, I support this legislation because the hon. the Minister has advanced cogent reasons for it. The one that always impresses me most when I hear a Minister speak in regard to legislation, is when he is able to recite the amount of consultation that has taken place between the affected people and his Department. That always impresses me, because it at least shows that the other sides have been heard and that their views and their problems have been dealt with.</p>
                        <p>I am a little concerned about a report in a Sunday newspaper about heavy truck drivers who claim that because of the refusal to renew permits many of them are going to be in serious financial straits. I think this may be an opportunity for the hon. the Minister to perhaps make a short reply to this statement I do not know the truth or the validity of it and I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would say something about it.</p>
                        <p>With these few words in regard to this legislation let me add immediately that the way this particular Bill has been presented to us does not surprise me coming from this particular Minister. In the years that I have spent in both Chambers, I, who have a reputation for clashing with many Ministers many times, think I have clashed with this particular Minister fewer times than with most. I think this is not due to any credit on my part but on the part of the hon. the Minister himself. His response has always been to deflate any attempt to put heat into a debate. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I am sorry to see him leave. I believe he not only added a great deal of status to the most difficult portfolio which he held, but that he graced this Parliament with a great deal of distinction. With these words I wish him a long and happy retirement if that is what he chooses. I hope that our association will continue despite the fact that he has left these halls and has moved into another sphere.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>By your leave, Mr. President, I too should like to address a few words to my colleague, Minister Muller, on his final appearance here.</p>
                        <p>It is probably not granted to all Ministers to depart with so many words of goodwill addressed so spontaneously from all sides of the House as has been the case here today. Consequently I think there is very great appreciation for this on his part, knowing in particular that this testimony of goodwill was made very sincerely and spontaneously. This came about because the life and the conduct of this hon. Minister in this Parliament has been such that both sides of the House are sorry that he will no longer be here to introduce his legislation. There are few people to whom it has been granted to take their leave in this way. Unfortunately the Leader of the Senate is not here today and that is why I should like to say on his behalf to the hon. the Minister that we are very grateful for and appreciative of what he has done, not only because of his competence, but for the exceptional way in which he co-operated and dealt with his legislation. The Government, too, could look on with pride and confidence when he stood up to handle a matter. I think my colleague can leave this House with the thought that everybody was extremely sorry when he took this step and that he listened only to words of goodwill. I can well understand why hon. Senators were not really inclined to discuss the legislation today. They preferred to express their goodwill to the Minister.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, on behalf of the Leader of the Senate and all of us here I want to say that the good wishes extended to the hon. the Minister, are the good wishes we also extend to Mrs. Muller. She has stood by him, and we hope that the two of them will have a long life of joy and prosperity together and that it will be as successful as it has been up to now. My very best wishes accompany my colleague.</p>

                        <p>Before I afford the hon. the Minister an opportunity to reply to the good wishes, I should also like to express our appreciation to the hon. the Minister from the Chair for the very courteous way in which he has always put his case in the Senate. He is an experienced parliamentarian and a person who has great respect for Parliament as an institution, and for its rules that have to be obeyed. What one appreciates in particular is the level-headed and friendly way in which he has always conducted himself here in the Senate, even in difficult situations and when discussing contentious legislation. We have great respect for this and appreciate it. I want to give him the assurance that the Secretariat has great appreciation for the courteous way in which he has always behaved towards them. We thank him for this and wish him and Mrs. Muller everything of the best.</p>

                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, in the first place I should like to deal with the legislation and the remarks made about it.</p>
                        <p>I am grateful to hon. Senators for giving this legislation their support. As far as road transportation is concerned, I want to say that this industry is entering a period of great uncertainty. This fact also has a bearing on the matter raised by the hon. Senator Winchester. I am not sure what precisely appeared in the newspapers, but if it was in the Sunday papers, I would advise the hon. Senator to read a book on Sundays instead. Had I known what it was all about, I would have been in a better position to reply. Nevertheless, I think I am right when I guess that it has to do with the decision to curtail road transportation. These cuts were decided on as a result of the oil crisis in which we find ourselves. The position not only creates a problem for South Africa, but in recent times it has become a problem for the whole world. At the moment there is a lot of uncertainty in regard to our fuel supplies. As a result an authoritative committee has been appointed to attempt to apply fuel-saving measures where possible. One of these measures is the provision that road transportation permits should be cut by 20% over the next six months. It has been decided to cut temporary permits by 90%. Similarly the Railways has undertaken on its part, to bring about a reduction of approximately 20% in its road transportation.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these measures decisions have been taken in regard to a great diversity of other proposals. It has been decided, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, that the electrification programme of the Railways should be speeded up so that the main routes, i.e. Johannesburg and Durban, Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg and Cape Town will be fully electrified as soon as possible. These are the circumstances which have forced us to take certain decisions with regard to road transportation. In all fairness I must say that over the last few days I have spent a lot of time on the road between Cape Town and my constituency, and I think that a lot of the traffic using fuel today could, if it really becomes necessary, be carried by the Railways using electrical or even steam traction.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary for Transport and chairman of the National Transport Commission has just informed me that he will hold discussions this afternoon with all the chairmen of local road transportation boards to discuss the matter in depth. He gives me the assurance that there will be uniform action and there will be no unreasonableness. But basically the problem is simply and solely the availability of fuel and as a result there is a cloud of uncertainty over road transportation from now on. We shall simply have to adapt to the circumstances which are forced on us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I should like in a few words to express my sincere appreciation to hon. Senators for the very nice things they had to say about me, as well as to my colleague next to me, the hon. Minister of Labour, and the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell. I include the hon. Senators on the other side who spoke.</p>
                        <p>†I refer to the hon. Senator Henderson, the hon. Senator Winchester and the hon. Senator Du Toit.</p>
                        <p>I would like to tell you, Mr. President, that I am leaving Parliament without regrets, because I have reason to believe that I have had my fair share. We all know what has happened during the past few days, and if I were to tell you that there was no disappointment whatsoever as far as I am concerned regarding the nomination in the NP caucus for the presidency, I would be dishonest; I could be called a liar. I was disappointed, but I am over it I think I have had a very full life. More than 44 years ago I started on the Railways as an apprentice turner and machinist, and from that humble position during the depression days when we were all very poor&#x2014;and I was particularly poor&#x2014;I have progressed to become the Minister of Transport What have I to complain about? Nothing whatsoever! I have had more than my due.</p>
                        <p>*I take my departure with great happiness and without any frustrations; I no longer have any ambitions. I am going to lead a more tranquil life and I leave this place with the knowledge that I have enjoyed a large measure of co-operation and pleasure in this Parliament. I have enjoyed it, and occasionally it was my pleasure to pilot very im portant legislation through Parliament. I had wonderful co-operation from my party over the years and to a large extent&#x2014;sometimes we clashed on political issues&#x2014;I have also had kindness and co-operation from the other side. For this I should like to express my highest appreciation. This is the highest institution in our country and we must at all time uphold its traditions and conventions in the interests of our country and its people.</p>
                        <p>I said in the Other Place that this was a peculiar place in this sense that many people have a strong desire to get here, and just cannot get here. Many want to be here and they do not succeed; it is difficult to get here. But if one has been here for 18 years, as I have, then it is also difficult to leave, and sometimes it is harder to leave than it was to come here. For your words, Mr. President, and for those of my colleague on my left and all the hon. Senators, my very sincere thanks. I am now going to have a good rest.</p>

                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, at the conclusion of the discussion last week I made certain remarks with reference to matters raised during the debate by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. I should like to carry on where I left off and return to one point which she made. She had raised a matter that had also been raised by other hon. Senators, in connection with the definition of an employee. We say now that an employee is a person who is White, Coloured, an Asian or a Black and who has the right to reside and has permanent employment in South Africa. A debate has resulted from this both here and outside, and I can therefore appreciate why hon. Senators would like greater clarity on this matter. I did intend clarifying this matter, regardless of the fact that hon. Senators commented on the matter and asked for an explanation.</p>
                        <p>May I just consider the history of this matter for a while. In the formulation of policy as well as legislation a government sometimes needs time to so formulate it that it can be regarded as watertight for the purpose for which it was introduced. It must be remembered that the legislation was introduced because of a report that was tabled at a rather late stage. This is one of those sensitive matters in regard to which my department and I feel that we have not had sufficient time to consider it well enough to enable us to give hon. Senators a final reply in regard to that formulation. When we first began to think about and look at the implications, and began to deal with the great diversity of possibilities and problems which could arise, we decided to keep the formula fairly narrow for this year&#x2019;s legislation, and to lay down two requirements, which I have already mentioned, viz. that a person must live here and must have permanent work. I realize that if we put it that way, for reasons which I myself see and am aware of, the formula will be too narrow for the purpose. Because we have not had sufficient time to look at it closely, however, I myself have said publicly on various occasions, particularly when talking to employees and employers about it, that these points need not be argued with me, and that I know the arguments both for and against it equally well. I raised this point in Durban when I addressed a meeting of about 900 to 1 000 employers. I also said that my reason for defining it so narrowly at this stage was purely technical. I can think of a great diversity of problems which must first be sorted out. I can think of problems which would affect a variety of people; the fact that some of them live in an independent country and others in a non-independent country. There is the problem that one might have a strike situation before we could make the necessary prior arrangements for solving it. We have the problem of migrant labourers, some of whom even come from outside South Africa. In the case of some of them the period they may work in South Africa is laid down as 18 months and even less than 18 months. Some of these migrant labourers go home but do not return. Hon. Senators can see therefore that there is a wide range of circumstances. Before I brought this legislation to the House I said that we had to make provision for exemptions. I realize at this stage that I shall have to grant immediate exemptions to workers from certain places. I myself mentioned Durban, because the position in Durban is such that some people live within a few kilometres of their work. It is unthinkable that we should in future exclude all the people who live in Kwa Mashu for example. If we exclude them we shall also have to exclude them from certain benefits, benefits accruing from trade union membership. I have opened the door in advance by saying: Look, as soon as the legislation is on the Statute Book, I shall immediately say to what extent we can grant exemptions in the uncomplicated cases.</p>
                        <p>Hon. Senators will concede that we shall have to give careful consideration to a diversity of cases. As I have said at various places, this is one of the spheres in which I shall have to introduce supplementary legislation as soon as possible. All I ask is the necessary time for consideration to decide how that legislation should be formulated. I do not want to commit myself to a formulation, Sir; I do not want to lay down a formula now and then come back next year and say we made a mistake. I would rather have the discretion now to expand the formula as time dictates and to come forward at some future date with a final formula.</p>
                        <p>In other words, hon. Senators should not read into this any ulterior motive to exclude certain workers permanently. Hon. Senators must see this as an opportunity which the Minister is requesting to do it in this way, because he has had too little time to study the problems, problems which cropped up after he had started framing the legislation and after various problems were submitted to him. That is why I say to hon. Senators that this formula will not remain like this. If we had received the report three or four months sooner, and if we had had the time required to sort out the problems, I might not have had to ask hon. Senators to be patient so that I could come back to them later with another formula. That is why I want to repeat what I have already said, and I say this to certain Black trade unions as well. They need not worry; as soon as we are able to do so I shall meet them and ask them to submit applications for exemption. There will be easy matters which will not cause any problems, and when there are difficult cases, they will be dealt with as accommodatingly as possible. I hope hon. Senators will accept my explanation in this connection.</p>
                        <p>There are a few other ideas I should like to elucidate further, ideas in regard to which we must understand one another. The one is not so much an idea, but rather the concept of the restructuring of work in the labour situation. What will we be faced with in future, Mr. President? We shall be confronted with a situation in the next few years where millions of people will enter the labour field. These millions of people all have the right to a place in the economy and the economy will have to make provision for this. If our economy does not provide for the employment of so many workers and people capable of work, a situation will develop in South Africa where a large number of people will be unemployed, and unemployment is the greatest danger which can threaten a country like South Africa. We shall have to try and avoid unemployment at all costs. If this country&#x2019;s economy grows&#x2014;at the moment it is still too low&#x2014;and gains full momentum, it will have a growth rate of 5% or 6%, or perhaps more. And if that happens we shall be faced with another sort of shortage, viz. a shortage of trained people. As things are today, in a period of recession we already have a shortage of trained people in many fields. Can you imagine what the position would be, Sir, when our economy grows at a rate of 4%, 5% or even 6% in the years ahead and there is an ever-increasing gap between the supply of trained persons and the demand for trained persons? If we are not in a position to provide that training, South Africa will be left behind and we shall not be able to participate in the growth which lies ahead. We shall not be able to use that growth to develop opportunities for the employment of the many millions who are going to enter the labour market. A question arises from this: While we are making provision for all workers in the country to participate in labour organizations, in other words, in that apparatus which will be available to decide their weal and woe on the factory floor, what do we do about the fear which so many people have&#x2014;I am thinking in particular of the Coloureds and the Whites &#x2014;that they are going to be ousted in future. That is a very important fear which we must bear in mind, and I mentioned this in the Other Place as well. The question then arises: Which institution shall determine who works where? Which institution shall have to determine what rights may be developed by the workers of the future? Sir, I say that that institution is the worker-cum-employer-cum-Government combined, and the place where it must be done is at the round table of the Industrial Conciliation Board. They will have to negotiate with one another. If it takes place there, one will have to understand clearly that a principle will have to be incorporated which is also a protection. This principle is also a responsibility, viz. the responsibility of the employee of ensuring that the vast economic machine keeps going, that a place should be made for people of colour who are still unable to do so to take their place in the economy. Provision must therefore be made for the employee to play an important part in the restructuring of the future labour pattern. In other words, in the future restructuring of the labour situation, the reply to the question of where the people will work and at what rate they will progress must be given in co-operation with the employees of South Africa. That is why the Government and I say today that in the restructuring of the labour situation the employer and the employee must accept equal responsibility in determining who shall work where and this will constitute a built-in protection for the employee. That restructuring will have to take place in co-operation with the employee.</p>
                        <p>And what does the legislation before us say? This legislation provides in various ways that the employee will have a say in who shall work where. That is an integral part of this legislation. The principle is the protection of a worker&#x2019;s rights, not job reservation. Job reservation is only a method of doing this. Previously we thought that we could protect the worker by making statutory provision for who could work where. This fulfilled a function in the past, Sir, but in today&#x2019;s situation it no longer fulfils that function. Therefore, in its place, it will be possible to work out meaningful workers&#x2019; protection through the participation of the worker himself. If hon. Senators look at the legislation, they will see that various possibilities have been built in for the worker to protect himself. In other words, round the conference table of the Industrial Council the worker will be able to decide, by way of agreement, what part of the work he relinquishes to somebody else who did not do it in the past In other words, he must also help to bear that responsibility. He has now been given the instrument of an industrial court as well as a National Manpower Commission. This commission will also be able to give advice in future on the important question of irregular or unfair labour practices. So if a labour practice were to develop there is an organization which can be consulted and to whom it can be said: &#x201C;Here is a labour practice; an incorrect tendency is developing&#x201D;. I lay a charge and I seek my rights there, and that organization must then come back to the Minister to declare that labour practice undesirable and to prohibit it, or to prohibit it by way of a judgement. In other words, we make this principle an integral part of the whole legislation and we say that in future the concept of an undesirable labour practice can develop and that it will be part of the future outlook. A Minister can step in and say: &#x201C;Restore the situation to what it was&#x201D;, or &#x201C;restore a person or a group of persons to their former positions&#x201D;. I now want to give you an example of what could happen. Should there be a tendency on the part of a certain manufacturer to eliminate people one by one over a long period and to put other people in their place, and a tendency is discerned, a complaint could be lodged in the following terms: &#x201C;Look, I notice a tendency here; here a number of people who were employed and who have been eliminated one after the other, and this must be stopped.&#x201D; The situation can be examined to see if it is a justified or unjustified tendency. In other words, instead of the Minister prescribing who shall work where, both employer and employee will in future decide who should work where. This has one very important advantage, which is that employees will no longer be able to think that they can merely hold a pistol to the employer&#x2019;s head and threaten him with the Minister by asking the Minister to introduce job reservation. No responsibility is taken. As somebody said to me once: It has nothing to do with me if the industry suffers; whether the employer is able to find other employees has nothing to do with me; that is his business and not mine; all I say is that I want to be protected. That is not the right attitude to adopt either, for if an employer wants to expand his business, and he does not have the people, then surely the right thing to do is to call employers and employees together and say to them: &#x201C;Look, I want to expand,&#x201D; or: &#x201C;There is a tendency for me to lose people; let us have a sensible decision as to which of the existing work you will keep, and which we can give to other people whom we still have to find.&#x201D; In other words, that is meaningful &#x2026;</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Very well, then. As far as the question of protection is concerned, I find it more meaningful too now because it also entails more responsibility. I cannot imagine that it would be right for a workers&#x2019; corps to deny work to a co-worker and simply to demand protection from the Government and employers without tendering any co-operation in the whole process of the restructuring of work.</p>
                        <p>I can mention as example something which happened last year, when the iron and steel industry entered into an agreement The Minister did not tell them what form the agreement should take. They negotiated their own agreement and what I am going to tell you about now they negotiated on their own initiative. When they came out the other side they were completely satisfied that they had agreed and decided for themselves where they would work, which work could be relinquished, and there was general satisfaction. In other words, what I am telling you now has already been demonstrated in practice.</p>
                        <p>I want to go further and say that the case I am now putting to the Senate is a matter which has been thoroughly discussed and thrashed out with the trade unions. They appreciate it, and the reason why there is a large measure of support today for the legislation, in the labour community as well, is because the labour community is satisfied that there are sufficient built-in protective measures. These protective measures are framed in such a way that they need not have the negative effect of keeping others out. In other words, in a changing economy one must build in protection as well as mobility. A person must know that he can also help decide his own fate, and that is precisely what we are doing here. That is why I am satisfied that together with what we are now envisaging here, we must also incorporate a protective measure for the workers of South Africa because I feel that they must enjoy the protection to which they are entitled. There must be co-responsibility to help determine the labour situation of the future and to work together so that everybody will have a place on the factory floor.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser said, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, that we should move slowly and that we should be careful. Of course we must be careful. There is no situation as explosive as the labour situation. This is not a situation where confidence can be lost If a Minister were to act in such a way in the labour situation that he did not gain the confidence of the workers, he could never hope to have peace and tranquillity on the labour front. To instil confidence in one another and to expect it of one another is also one of the objectives of this legislation.
                        </p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser said we should not throw the White people to the wolves. No one is going to be thrown to the wolves. Whites will not be thrown to the wolves. Obviously a Minister would be unreasonable if he were to act in such a way that he threw his people who were an integral part of a labour situation to the wolves. To tell the truth, I never use the words &#x201C;thrown to the wolves&#x201D;. They never occur to me because they constitute a negative statement As far as I am concerned, I think we must see the matter positively for the future and must talk of how we can reorganize the labour scene in South Africa meaningfully so that everyone will have his place and will not feel threatened by anyone else.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Dr. Visser also asked me to move slowly. Yes, one cannot move more rapidly in this field than the rate at which one is able to take people along with one, and this also applies to the employees. I cannot move more rapidly in this field than the employees are prepared to go along with me. Up to now I have had very staunch support from the employee organizations, and for this I am very grateful. Consequently I want to give the assurance that any action taken will be taken with the greatest degree of sympathy and we shall try to allay the fears and to make the major principle of self-protection and co-protection an integral part of the legislation. I am pleased that this House and the Other Place agree with me, in fact that the whole country agrees with me, including trade unions, that section 77 can be deleted and that instead of section 77 we should have something which can be established to our own satisfaction, and which will embody a dynamic facet in the whole labour situation in South Africa. That is why I want to give the assurance that we shall act with the greatest caution and sympathy. I also want to tell the Senate that we shall introduce further legislation in future but I shall not introduce any legislation if the matter has not been thrashed out and settled with the existing trade unions. During recent months I have talked to the representatives of literally hundreds of thousands of people for days on end. We have given one another reciprocal assurances. I am satisfied that I can say today that by far the greatest majority of organized labour in South Africa supports this legislation. If that confidence continues and we can negotiate with one another with the necessary collaboration and sympathy and produce legislation which will give satisfaction, we shall succeed in future in preserving a labour situation which has been maintained up to now in peace and tranquillity. I am convinced, Mr. President, that in the years which lie ahead we shall handle this situation with the greatest circumspection and sympathy. If we do not do that, as I said the other day, a clash on the labour floors in South Africa will develop immediately into a White-Black conflict, and I want to avoid that at all costs.</p>
                        <p>I thank hon. Senators for their patience and I think that in replying to specific questions put to me, and the assurances I have given as to what will happen in the future, I have satisfied this hon. House.</p>

                    <p>Clause 1:</p>
                    <speech by="#scheepers">
                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, in no way do I doubt the undertaking given by the hon. the Minister that he will treat the matter of membership sympathetically, but we feel so strongly about this clause that we cannot agree to it in its present form. I want therefore to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">On page 2, in line 26, to omit all the words after &#x201C;Africa,&#x201D; up to and including &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; on page 4, in line 10.</block>
                        <p>I pointed out during the Second Reading debate how difficult it will be to carry out the provisions of this clause. I do not want to repeat what I have already said, but I must point out that I was correct not only in regard to the feelings of the Black trade unions but also in regard to those of a very large number of the registered trade union movements. As I expected, the reaction of the Black trade unions has been very sharp and according to a report in yesterday&#x2019;s 
                            <i>Sunday Times</i> some of them have stated that they are not going to register. Here a serious clash can take place because these unions could formerly not be registered. They acted as unregistered trade unions all along. I pointed out to the hon. the Minister that certain of these unions had achieved benefits for their members. Although they were unregistered they covered all the workers in a given industry. I can see that the hon. the Minister is sympathetic particularly in regard to some of the commuters, and on that we have very strong feelings. If there are people who are still outside in independent states, we feel this is a matter that can be delayed, but as far as the commuters are concerned I do not think we can delay the matter because it will cut the membership of some of the trade unions by a considerable amount and it will certainly lead to unrest if these workers are told that they cannot belong to the unions any longer and therefore cannot enjoy the benefits for which they had paid over all these years. What will the Minister do should these unions refuse to register under the circumstances? According to the 
                            <i>Sunday Times</i> the Black unions are going to make representations to the hon. the Minister and I hope that at this late stage we will be able to come to some agreement with the hon. the Minister in regard to exemptions. I suggested in my Second Reading speech that the hon. the Minister should exempt all present members of trade unions so that they do not lose their membership and benefits that they have enjoyed for a very long time.
                        </p>
                        <p>In terms of the Bill unregistered trade unions will not be able to continue. I agree with the principle that unregistered trade unions should not be able to operate providing that their desires are met in the same way as those of other trade unions; that they will not be forced to give up their present membership, and that there will not be any division between organized workers and unorganized commuters or migrant workers. As I pointed out, I feel that we will have to give some thought to the matter as far as the migrant workers are concerned. I shall therefore not press that point too strongly. But as far as the commuters are concerned we must press very, very strongly because some of these people have been members of their trade unions for 30 years or longer.</p>
                        <p>People both here and abroad were most impressed with the Wiehahn report. I sent some reports overseas and the reaction was very favourable from those who received it. They felt that at last we were starting on the right track.</p>
                        <p>I wish to tell hon. Senators that I feel I cannot reply to those people and tell them about the provisions of the legislation because they will consider it a big bluff on the part of the Government. Unfortunately, the blame will not only be laid at the door of the Government but also at the door of White South Africa. We are all going to suffer as a result and, if we do take steps to try to overcome these problems in respect of Black/ White relationships, nobody will believe us until we prove that we have done it. To send them reports and to explain to them that things are improving will not help in the least because it has happened time and again that good reports, like the Theron Commission Report, were published and nothing was done. In respect of this Bill I personally had great hopes that something positive was going to materialize. When I spoke about the report of the commission I paid tribute to the hon. the Minister. I know that the hon. the Minister is not having an easy time because one always hears rumblings from his side of the House. But we have to consider what is in the best interests of South Africa and all its people. Even the hon. Senator Dr. Loock admitted that there was so much pressure from abroad that we cannot afford to let this situation continue any longer.</p>
                        <p>We have always maintained that there can be no justification for the fact that when there are jobs available the colour of a person&#x2019;s skin prevents him from taking those jobs. As far as the membership of trade unions is concerned, I am very pleased that the principle of recognized Black trade unions has now been accepted. But now we come with all the frills that spoil the whole thing. I want to ask the hon. the Minister not to allow the outside world to consider White South Africans as being crooks and dishonest people; that we only talk about doing away with discrimination but that in actual fact we do very little. They will maintain that we are either trying to hoodwink them or that we are underestimating their intelligence. In the light of this I ask the hon. the Minister to accept the amendment so that the Bill will be more acceptable to all concerned, namely the registered White trade unions, the Black trade unions, the overseas trade unions and the International Labour Organization. I intend speaking later on the principles they have adopted. Freedom of association means freedom for all people and I hope the hon. the Minister will allow Black workers the same freedom of association as White workers. People living in the border areas, although they are regarded as being resident in homelands, are part and parcel of this Republic. They are part of the Republic and even if they commute daily to White South Africa they should be included in the provisions of this Bill now and not at a later stage.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I am going to make the assumption that in speaking to clause 1, and in particular to the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D;, this brings in the whole question of freedom of association. I hope I will not be in conflict with the Chair when I speak widely on this question. This is how I see the position. In his earlier remarks today I understood the hon. the Minister to say that the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; was really basic to the difficulties he was experiencing not simply from this side of the House but more especially from his own side.</p>
                        <p>I was very pleased that the hon. the Minister dealt with the question of Durban. He will recollect that in my speech during the Second Reading debate I dealt specifically with the situation at Kwa Mashu and the situation at Newcastle. On that occasion I mentioned that it appeared from a report I read in the Press that as few as 3% of the Black workers in the greater Durban area would in fact enjoy rights under this Bill when it becomes law. I understood the hon. the Minister to say that I was incorrect as far as that was concerned.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>I accept that, but it would be interesting to know what the percentage of Blacks in greater Durban will be who will be able to enjoy the rights accorded under this Bill. If the hon. the Minister has that percentage I would be very grateful to him if he could advise us what it is.</p>
                        <p>I understood the hon. the Minister this afternoon to give an assurance that he would take into consideration the peculiar position of the Kwa Mashu workers. I trust that that means that the Kwa Mashu workers will obtain blanket exemption which the hon. the Minister is empowered to grant in terms of this Bill. I do not know if that is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention. He did not say so and I would like to know what his intention is. He will probably say that every case will be considered on its merits, and in that case the hon. the Minister will probably have to consider the case of almost 200 000 Black workers in Natal. As I read the Wiehahn Commission Report and the figures contained in it, about 200 000 people are affected as frontier commuters. When the hon. the Minister is considering this matter I would like to know if he is going to give a blanket exemption to that class of person.</p>
                        <p>I also mentioned to the hon. the Minister that the same position applied as regards the workers in Newcastle. I imagine that no more than 3% of the workers in Newcastle will receive the benefits of the Bill unless an exemption is granted to the commuters from Madadeni who commute a mere 3 km or 4 km in some cases to the Iscor works. It is from here that the whole labour force of Newcastle is drawn, with the exception of some Blacks who are living on private premises and who work as domestic servants. I do feel that a very strong case has been made out for them and I trust that the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to give a blanket exemption as far as these people are concerned.</p>
                        <p>I am glad that the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers referred to a report in the business section of the 
                            <i>Sunday Times.</i> I will deal with this matter again in the Third Reading debate. What is said in that report in the 
                            <i>Business Times</i> is very disturbing indeed. I treat much that we read in the 
                            <i>Sunday Times</i> with a good deal of circumspection &#x2026;

                        <p>Yes, and much of what I read in other newspapers as well, including 
                            <i>Die Vaderland.</i> As far as the business portion of the 
                            <i>Sunday Times</i> is concerned I do not think politics enter into it at all. I think it would be unfair of anybody to maintain that this is so. If this report, which I have before me, is in fact correct, then it is a very disturbing thing indeed. I intend to deal with this matter further at the Third Reading if I have an opportunity to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am somewhat staggered to see that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser is not with us this afternoon. I greatly regret it because I understood him to ask the hon. the Minister certain questions and the hon. the Minister will not be able to reply to those questions. He might well not be here for some reason that is not clear to me, but I mention it because I was greatly surprised&#x2014;as were all the hon. Senators on this side of the House&#x2014; firstly, that the hon. Senator L. J. van den Bergh whom I have always understood to be the spokesman on the Nationalist benches on matters of labour sat in his seat and did not utter a word when the Second Reading was dealt with on Friday, and secondly, that he, too, is not here this afternoon. We can of course draw certain conclusions which might be unfair, from the absence of these hon. gentlemen, but as far as the hon. Senator Dr. Visser is concerned, no unfair conclusions need be drawn. He made it perfectly clear during the Second Reading debate what his views on this matter were. I have his Hansard before me. The hon. the Minister dealt to a certain extent with what the hon. Senator Dr. Visser had said, but the hon. Senator Dr. Visser took this matter very far indeed. I would have liked to have had a little exchange of views with him this afternoon, which I shall now not be able to have.</p>

                        <p>Just you have a little patience and you will learn what I am referring to. I want to deal now with this question of freedom of association and that portion of the White Paper dealing with this very question. It is headed &#x201C;freedom of association&#x201D; and appears on page 11. I quote&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">On the principle of &#x201C;freedom of association&#x201D; and the membership of trade unions the commission&#x2019;s majority recommendation is that:
                            <br/>both trade union organizations and individuals should be afforded full freedom of association in that individuals should be free to join any appropriate trade union of their choice and that trade unions should be free to prescribe such membership qualifications in their constitutions as they may deem fit, whether or not race, colour or sex is a consideration; that any trade union which meets the requirements for registration in the restructured system should irrespective of colour, race or sex of its members be eligible for registration and full participation in the statutory bargaining and dispute prevention and settlement machinery.
                        </block>
                        <p>Now, this recommendation is accepted with reservations, says the White Paper. I quote&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">While the Government fully agrees with the principle of freedom of association as the basis for trade union membership reliance must be placed on the guidance of the National Manpower Commission and the judgment of the Minister as far as its implementation is concerned. In the Government&#x2019;s view the most important need of the day is to give Black workers who are in permanent jobs and who therefore constitute a permanent part of the labour force access to machinery which was in the first instance developed for and is being utilized by South Africa&#x2019;s permanent labour force.</block>
                        <p>[Interjection.] Yes, it is very interesting. I shall tell you why it is interesting. A tittle further it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">The Government&#x2019;s decision at this juncture accordingly is that all persons irrespective of race, colour or sex who enjoy permanent residence in South Africa and who are in fixed employment will automatically be eligible for trade union membership.</block>
                        <p>Now, Sir, I mention all this for no other reason than that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser has said that this is not the policy of the NP. We have it clearly here that either the White Paper is talking a lot of bunkum and should never have been printed, or the White Paper when it says that this is what is accepted by the Government is telling us that this is Government policy. I believe it is.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say that I think the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers set it out very well. But I want to say something else to the hon. the Minister. I am impressed with his sincerity; I am impressed with his knowledge of the subject and I am impressed with his intentions. But I am not impressed with his Bill. We know through long experience&#x2014;any of us who have sat here for any length of time should know&#x2014;that it is what is contained in the legislation that counts, not what the hon. the Minister says. For instance, the hon. the Minister says that he is most sympathetic in regard to migrant workers, that he knows that this is a tremendous problem, one of historical proportions. I accept all that. But, Mr. Chairman, that is not in the Bill. Nowhere in the Bill does it say that the hon. the Minister will come in a few months time, in the next session of Parliament, and change or amend the Bill that is now before us. There is no guarantee whatsoever that any of the things the hon. the Minister said will in due course be carried out. I will accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s word; I will accept his intentions, but you know, Mr. Chairman, that he may not even be the Minister of Labour in a few weeks time or in a few days&#x2019;s time. It could be anybody else with the reshuffling that is taking place in the Cabinet. It could be any Tom, Dick or Harry who takes over from this Minister. This Minister is a capable Minister of Labour. I personally would be sorry to see him go. While that Government is in power I believe he does a very good job. I believe he does talk to the people and not at them. So, Mr. Chairman, I am not saying this in any derogatory sense and neither do I have any wish to quarrel with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intentions or integrity. But what I am saying Sir, is how in heaven&#x2019;s name can he ask me to support legislation which is only in the words out of his mouth and not in the printed document before me? The printed document before me, in fact, excludes the vast majority of the Durban labour force&#x2014;whether it be 3%, 4%, 5% or 10% is neither here nor there. The vast majority of the Durban labour force are being victimized by this legislation. The hon. the Minister says it is a problem; he accepts that and he intends to do something about it. But I am asked to vote for a clause which does not contain a single word of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intentions or promises.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>But the Minister may not be this particular hon. Minister in a few weeks&#x2019; time. I have had personal experience of dealing with a particular Minister in respect of a particular problem. The Minister changes his portfolio or leaves the Cabinet and the new Minister says he knows nothing about any undertakings given to me by the previous Minister. The new Minister is not tied down to anything promised by the previous Minister. [Interjections.] Hon. Senators opposite can mutter as much as they like; they swallow hook, line and sinker everything told to them in their caucus meetings. They do not impress me one bit, Sir.</p>
                        <p>Where the hon. the Minister also disappoints me, Sir, despite the high regard I have for him, is that when one looks at the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own memorandum one notices that that does not tie up entirely with what appears in the printed document with which we are dealing. I shall deal with that in a moment.</p>
                        <p>I think the Wiehahn Report is certainly the most important document on labour that we have had for many, many years in South Africa. As previous hon. Senators have said, it created a tremendous impression overseas. It created the impression overseas that at last South Africa was beginning to enter the modern age, the twentieth century, in regard to its labour legislation. Not that there is so much wrong with the labour legislation, Sir, except for the fact that it has been tainted and hog-tied by racial discrimination. But the report we had before us gave the world the impression that we were going to move into a new era in South Africa. The hon. the Minister used the exact words when he addressed this House. He uses those words when he talks to the public. But in respect of the question of union rights for migrant workers, for example, there is a majority view which this Bill ignores completely. The majority view was that no restrictions or qualifications should be placed on eligibility for trade union membership. That view is ignored in this Bill and the minority view is accepted. The Commission does not accept Mr. Nieuwoudt&#x2019;s view which says that &#x201C;no Black migrant workers should have registered or unregistered trade union rights&#x201D; but that view is accepted in the Bill. The hon. the Minister, has in fact, accepted the minority view. The report has had praise heaped on it from all over the world but the hon. the Minister does not accept the report at all. He takes the minority view, the minority view in regard to migrant labourers. As I say, this is my great concern.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister knows better than probably anyone else in this House that clause 1 is in fact a highly dangerous clause. He has spoken of the danger of unemployment, the danger of labour unrest. The hon. the Minister knows that as well as most of us do and he must surely appreciate that what he is doing here by excluding such a vast number of people from rights to which they are entitled, is to gamble with the security of South Africa. That is what he is doing, and it is no good the hon. the Minister saying to me that he is going to come with new legislation; that he is going to have a look at this problem because he accepts that something should be done about it. Sir, he is playing with fire when he says that because by the time he can physically do something about it, the damage may well have been done. The bitterness will have been created, the fires will have been stoked and that is the sort of thing that we are trying to avoid.</p>
                        <p>Before I go any further I want once again to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the following amendments that my party moved in the Other Place, viz.&#x2014;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(1) On page 2, in line 24, to omit all the words after &#x201C;employer&#x201D; up to and including &#x201C;made;&#x201D; on page 4, in line 27.</li>
                            <li>(2) On page 4, in lines 42 to 44, to omit the definition of &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D; and to substitute:</li>
                        </ol>
                        <block name="quote">&#x201C;&#x2018;unfair labour practice&#x2019; means the dismissal of any employee, or the reduction of any employee&#x2019;s rate of remuneration, or the alteration of an employee&#x2019;s terms or conditions of employment to terms or conditions of employment less favourable to him, or the disadvantageous alteration by an employer of the position of any employee as compared to the positions of other employees employed by such employer, for reasons other than&#x2014;</block>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(i) those recognized by law as sufficient to justify summary dismissal; or</li>
                            <li>(ii) those related to the capability of an employee to perform work of the kind which he was employed by the employer to perform; or</li>
                            <li>(iii) the reason of redundancy.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I want to deal with the second amendment, namely &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D;. When one looks at that wording as it appears in this clause, it seems all very well. If it means what I think it means in English &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, for the edification of the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat, I should like to say a few words. As far as I could understand what he was saying&#x2014;I may be wrong &#x2014;he said at the beginning of his speech that he could not enunciate his views better than they were expressed by the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers. His inference from that would seem to be that the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers should have opposed the Bill. As I understand the procedure in Parliament it is this: That one generally opposes a Bill if it does not improve the existing legal position, when that Bill has the intention of amending an existing law. Nobody in my submission can seriously say that the position of the Blacks and of labour generally in South Africa is not being improved by this Bill. There is a very considerable improvement. We could not possibly vote against the Bill but we are voting against certain clauses, as I understand. I agree that there is a large number of unsatisfactory aspects in the Bill. I think the hon. the Minister has gone a long way to admitting that certain aspects are not satisfactory but that the time at his disposal was too short to come forward with a Bill that would have met the circumstances of the day, and that he intends to amend it from time to time. That was what I understood him to say. Let it be made quite clear that the Official Opposition is in favour of the Bill as a whole but that we have very grave objections to certain clauses of the Bill. [Interjections.] We voted for the Bill at Second Reading and at the Third Reading we shall again vote in favour of it.</p>
                        <p>I said deliberately that I did not want to say anything that would embarrass the hon. the Minister. What I am saying I am saying to embarrass the hon. Senator Dr. Visser. I submit that the hon. Senator Dr. Visser does not represent the NP policy as we find it reflected in the White Paper. He does not represent it, and I think that is clear from what the hon. the Minister has said. I was not at this stage going to refer to an article that appeared in the 
                            <i>Sunday Times</i> but I think I have got to do so now. The reason why I am totally opposed to the view of the hon. Senator Dr. Visser is because he represents something that is a real danger to South Africa. [Interjections.] I am glad to know there is this division; I am glad to know that hon. Senators on that side of the House agree with me. This article reads&#x2014;
                        </p>
                        <block name="quote">Deadlock looms over Black union registration: A show-down is looming between Government and the Black trade union movement which is on the brink of deciding not to register. The Black unions are currently drafting a memorandum to the Minister of Labour setting out their grievances. They are also planning to seek top-level discussion with the Government in an effort to avoid deadlock.</block>
                        <p>This is very serious. The hon. the Minister himself has said that labour matters are extremely delicate in the political sense and that there can be confrontation between Black and White if something goes wrong, and that none of us seeks. Every responsible person in this country, Black or White, seeks to avoid such confrontation. The attitude that the hon. Senator Visser is adopting&#x2014;and I wish he were here so I could say this to his face but he will have to read the Hansard&#x2014;is a dangerous attitude. I want to refer to his speech in which he said &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>He is not here but that is unfortunate for him. I would like to get this on record. In his speech he said the following and I quote&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Ons weet wat the gevare van die kommunistiese wêreld is en hoe hulle te werk gaan om ons vakbonde al hoe meer te probeer ondermyn teen ons Blankes en teen ons Regering in Suid-Afrika, en nie alleen teen ons Blankes nie maar ook teen the verantwoordelike Nieblanke. En die verantwoordelike Nieblanke is net so min aanvaarbaar vir the kommunisme as wat &#x2019;n verantwoordelike Blanke vir hulle aanvaarbaar is.</block>
                        <p>He says this and yet this is the very thing that the attitude that he is adopting wifi bring about. It is cutting the ground from under the feet of the responsible Black worker about whom we have heard so much from the hon. Senator Scheepers. She knows them; she works with them; they are here. They are responsible people. Those are the people whom we must get on our side. And here is an attitude of mind in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s party which absolutely flies in the face of all this desire for co-operation by us on this side of the House, by the majority of hon. Senators on that side of the House and by these Black workers themselves. According to this re port, this is a statement which was apparently made by one of the Black union leaders. Let us hear what he has to say. I quote&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">We understand that the Government is constrained in the rate of progress by its right wing and the fear of a backlash among conservative White workers and voters. But we are also under pressure to deliver the goods. If we who are moderate do not succeed in showing reasonable progress we will be replaced by the more aggressive leaders. That has already been made clear to us.</block>

She can rise now and say whether or not these are the sentiments of these people. This expresses the sentiments of these people. That is why the attitude that is adopted by the&#x2014;let me use the modern term &#x2014;verkrampte section of South Africa&#x2014; whether on this side or on that side of the House makes no difference&#x2014;is such a dangerous attitude. That is why this hon. Minister requires all the support he can possibly get and that is why he will get the support from this side of the House. [Interjections.] Of course he is getting the support and we will continue to give him our full support. However, what we say and what we plead for is precisely the opposite of what the hon. Senator Dr. Visser pleads for. We plead that the whole of this movement forward be accelerated. That is what we are pleading for. We say that this is too slow, and by Jove, Sir, every one of us sitting here today knows it is too slow. Time is not on our side. One looks to the north and one looks to the west and one realizes time is not on our side. The hon. the Minister is a convert to the ideas of Professor Wiehahn and that is why he requires from his own side, from that side of the House, all the support that he can possibly get.</p>

                    <speech by="#winchester">
                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I just wish to finish my argument and my discussion in regard to the second part of the amendment. If the hon. the Minister will look at that he will see it deals with the provision in respect of unfair labour practice. If the hon. the Minister will refer to his explanatory memorandum he will see that that term is explained as follows&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">A new definition viz. &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D; has been inserted to deal with future situations where disputes arise between employees and employers who change traditional work practices.</block>
                        <p>In other words, the term &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D; has in fact been inserted as a new definition to deal with what the explanatory memorandum calls traditional labour practices. This appears at the bottom of page 2 of the explanatory memorandum.</p>
                        <p>I should very much like to know just what in fact that traditional labour practice is. What is traditional to our labour force here in South Africa? It seems to me that what was traditional labour practice five, ten or fifteen years ago, is certainly not traditional labour practice today. During the past five to ten years approximately 20 000 Blacks have been doing jobs which were previously reserved for Whites on the Railways, and the same applies to the Post Office and many other sectors of our economy. Blacks or non-Whites are today doing work that was traditionally done by Whites in the past. That is a traditional labour practice. It was traditional at that time. It is no longer traditional today. Therefore when the hon. the Minister uses that definition in his explanatory memorandum, I believe it complicates the issue even further. What is &#x201C;unfair labour practice&#x201D; should in fact have nothing to do with the traditional labour practice that he is talking about because that has been changing from year to year. Therefore my amendment seeks to set out what in fact would be unfair labour practices. They are quite the normal ones which one would expect between labour and management and I do believe that this is a far better definition than the one that is contained in the Bill.</p>
                        <p>I want to leave that particular point at that and return to the argument I was advancing earlier in regard to the question of the border workers or the migrant workers. I want to say to the hon. the Minister as I said earlier that every authority, even his own authority in this booklet 
                            <i>Empact</i> which carries a message from him at the beginning of the book, runs contrary to what is contained in the legislation. I want to quote from page 7 of the booklet where it says &#x201C;all employees qualify&#x201D;. I assume that what is contained in this booklet has the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s approval since he has attached a message to it. This deals with the Wiehahn Commission and reads as follows&#x2014;
                        </p>
                        <block name="quote">The Commission concluded that no restrictions or qualifications should be placed on the eligibility for trade union membership of any worker irrespective of whether he was a migrant worker or a commuter. In the interaction between employer and his employees the Commission took the view that what really was of importance was that a person whatever his origin was an employee and that there should be appropriate machinery to deal with employees collectively.</block>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister must admit that that is not contained in the Bill before us. This is the booklet that dealt with the Wiehahn report. The Wiehahn report makes the same point, and so does the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s memorandum. I do not believe that it is good enough for the hon. the Minister to tell the House and to tell the country that he accepts that it is a problem and that he is going to deal with it, but that he has not had time to handle that particular part of the new machinery for labour regulations at this stage. By putting that restriction here, I believe he is in fact, as I said just now, taking a dangerous course, a course that could so damage labour relations&#x2014;and labour relations and race relations are one and the same thing in South Africa&#x2014;that it would have been best left out altogether. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intentions cannot be followed up in the time available to us, that is in the next few months. The hon. the Minister will have to come with legislation. Is that right? If the hon. the Minister can assure me that he does not have to come with legislation to amend this but that he can do this by proclamation, I would like to know when he intends to do it, how soon he intends to do it, because the longer he delays the more damage is going to be done. Mr. Chairman, this is the prime reason why I cannot accept this legislation. If the hon. the Minister can give me some satisfaction, some reassurance&#x2014;not me, but the people affected&#x2014;on this highly contentious and highly dangerous matter, I would be very pleased.</p>

                    <speech by="#minister-of-labour">
                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I should now like to try to reduce something which appears to be very complicated and some which has attracted complicated argument to its simplest possible form. What have we before us today? We have before us a Bill which for the first time provides that Blacks may belong to registered trade unions and that they will be recognized. That is, as far as the concept of association is concerned, the kind of step that was asked for to give satisfaction. Since I became Minister of Labour the great dispute in South Africa has always been that according to law the Black man was not a worker. The law now states that he is a worker. It is further provided that if the Black man is a worker he may also organize a trade union. I do not want to argue about the underlying philosophy now because the time factor is unfortunately against us. For the time being, though, I just want to say that I think I have gone a long way by saying that all persons who are organized into a trade union, whoever they may be, must be registered. This refers to newcomers as well, because I want to know what they are doing. I want to see what they are doing and I want to know where their funds come from. I want to know who is organizing the new trade union and whether they are participating in politics. This applies to everyone.</p>
                        <p>Now the problem we are saddled with is how to ascertain who the newcomers are, i.e. the Blacks according to the definition. One could argue incessantly to formulate a definition of a newcomer, for some of the Black people live across the border in another state, but work in an adjoining state. They live in a certain state and may decide one night that they will go on strike in South Africa the next day. Tonight, however, they are in another state where we cannot reach them and that creates a difficulty for we are then dealing with an international situation.</p>
                        <p>What is more, tomorrow those persons go on strike in one of our factories&#x2014;I am not saying it will happen but am simply indicating the possibilities&#x2014;and the following day they catch a train back to another state and they then become citizens of that other state. Then they stand outside picketing the factory to keep other workers away. There is a clash and which subsequently gives rise to serious problems. Two countries are now involved in the matter and the Minister of Foreign Affairs is drawn into it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, the Wiehahn commission makes a very interesting point in its report. Hon. Senators should read it. 
                            <i>Inter alia</i>, it says that there should be inter-state agreements for certain cases. I am bearing all that in mind. If a person is a worker and he works here I should like to recognize him and I should like him to belong to a body with which we can discuss matters. However, I also want to ensure that the governments of other states and the heads of other organizations and I have been able to hold consultations with one another as to the action we should take in case of a strike. With whom do I lodge a complaint if something like that were to happen? I do not want to mention the names of any states, but hon. Senators will realize where this can lead to.
                        </p>
                        <p>That is the reason why I have asked hon. Senators to give me a chance to study the host of problematical cases that could arise in an attempt to find a formula that would cover all those cases properly. If we are in too great a hurry and do not examine all the aspects properly we could perhaps decide on a formula which I would not regard as sufficiently watertight.</p>
                        <p>However, I know what is troubling hon. Senators but I do not think that it is such a very serious problem because I have said this before in the Other Place and elsewhere, and I am saying it now for the third time in this House: Those trade unions that are known to us and whose members live in orderly communities, for example, at Kwa Mashu and many other places&#x2014;I have a long list of such places from the Ciskei as far as Gazankulu, Lebowa, Venda, QwaQwa, Bophuthatswana and Transkei&#x2014;do not present any problem. Six hundred and eight thousand clients work in the various towns in the states I have mentioned; we are now dealing with them and we have to sort them out. I have said in this House before that in my opinion some cases are reasonably straightforward. Therefore, I want to give the assurance once again that I shall not wait until December but that I shall in all probability invite all interested parties in August for the simple reason that I know that they, too, want clarity on the matter. As a matter of fact, the newspapers have already been full of it. It suits me, and not them so much, to consult with these Black trade unions so that we and they may know where we stand. I shall summon the trade unions and say to them: For the time being we can exempt the following people. After that I shall ask my department to assist me in clearing up matters and in that way we shall satisfy a large number of trade unions. There are problematical cases that I shall not have solved by August. I do not know when we shall have sorted those out. In other words, Sir, I require a little more time to deal with problematical cases.</p>
                        <p>But if I were to tell hon. Senators across the floor of the House today that I shall shortly, early in the recess, go out of my way to grant exemption to a large number of trade unions&#x2014;I am tempted to mention some of them by name but I think that would be unfair&#x2014;would that satisfy them? Does that help hon. Senators?</p>

                        <p>Very well, then we understand one another. If hon. Senators are satisfied, we need not argue any further. I give them the assurance now that I shall try to clear up this matter as soon as possible. Why? Not because hon. Senators have asked for it, but because I want to establish order as soon as possible and find out where we stand with one another. However, I want to repeat that even if we were to talk until tomorrow morning, there is one thing that I cannot do. I cannot say right out that I shall delete the clause and throw the door so wide open that I shall not be able to close it tomorrow. I do not want to do that. I want an opportunity to look at all the problematical cases. Why do I say that, Sir? Many prominent industrialists who have many of these people in their employ, come and talk to me. I also receive messages from them. Hon. Senators will be surprised to know that I receive messages warning me and asking whether I had thought of certain difficulties that could arise if I were to admit certain people. I refer once again to the case of people who come from across the border to work here. For example over 200 000 come from Mozambique to work in our mines here.</p>

I put this question in the Other Place: &#x201C;Do you really mean that people who come from Mozambique to work in the mines for 18 months&#x2014;people who are raw, who have to be trained and who work here at a fixed rate for a fixed period&#x2014;should have trade union rights in our country?&#x201D;</p>

                        <p>Very well, now hon. Senators agree with me but the arguments advanced in the Other Place gave the impression that they and hon. members there did not belong to the same party. All I want to do is to indicate how difficult it is. Supposing there are workers who come from Mozambique on a regular basis and virtually go home for holidays only. Such a worker may perhaps have been working here for 30 years already; he may even already have become a &#x201C;boss boy&#x201D;. Must I admit him?</p>

                        <p>I want to give hon. Senators the assurance that I shall act soon and that I shall grant exemptions wherever possible. As far as the straightforward cases are concerned I hope to have done so by August. Another point I want to make is that before this legislation is placed on to the Statute Book and before these people have organized themselves and completed the forms the next session of Parliament will be due. In other words, not all that much time will have elapsed before we take the next step. I appeal to hon. Senators therefore not to press me when I have little time at my disposal within which to draft a formula which I am not sure is the right one. I want time to see whether or not I am right. Because I know there are cases that will be adversely affected, I want to give the assurance that I shall do my utmost to assist them as soon as possible. What could be fairer than that? That, then, is also my reply to the arguments that have been advanced. I shall not act in an irresponsible manner. After all I know that if I am not careful I shall cause difficulty and surely that is not what I want to do. I do not want to commit an unjust act which may lead to eruptions and labour unrest. I want to avoid that. In this connection I want to tell hon. Senators that I will assist the organizations. Before legislation in this connection was tabled in Parliament I had already told thousands of industrialists throughout the country the things that I have just told hon. Senators. I said that six weeks or a month ago when we started to discuss these matters. The department saw these matters as part of its negotiations. So it is nothing new, because industrialists were already aware of these things before hon. Senators knew about them.</p>
                        <p>The next matter I want to deal with refer to unfair labour practices. An unfair labour practice is not a formulated practice but something which develops gradually. It is a practice which may quite justifiably present a completely different aspect in 20 or 50 years&#x2019; time to what it presents today. We are establishing a labour court which will not only adjudicate on rights like an ordinary court, but also on interests. That is why this new court will not operate according to our usual legal system as is also the case in other parts of the world. At the moment we have a labour tribunal but this tribunal is not so much concerned with rights as with interests such as wages, etc. But the new labour court will be concerned with wages and interests. In future this court will, in the same way as our legal system is undergoing evolutionary changes today, conduct investigations but it will have the benefit of a commission which is able to advise it as to whether or not it will be in the interests of an organization to lay down a formula in due course. If such a situation arises therefore, the Minister must not be asked whether it is a good or bad labour practice. The matter must be submitted to the court which will then investigate the matter in conjunction with the Manpower Commission. Then the court decides what rights the people have and what is in their best interests. I cannot amend this clause, therefore, because I want the labour court itself to have the opportunity in future to draft a formula on what is an unfair labour practice.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to say immediately that the last part of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech impressed me. It makes a good deal of sense. My amendment does not alter that situation that much and therefore I will let it stand. I am not quarrelling with the hon. the Minister too strongly on that point.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of this speech the hon. the Minister talked about the difficulties he has with the migrant labourer coming over the border, causing trouble and skipping over the border again. I do not want to be facetious but I can remember that when we have discussed this whole question of Bantustans and borders over the years we have all taken that particular point, viz. that you could make every little incident an international issue. The hon. the Minister has used exactly the same words as I have heard expressed from this side of the House for many years. But I will let that pass because we are dealing with something more important.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister says he will act speedily, and I accept that he will try. I know that things often do not run smoothly and that he may probably not be able to adhere to the time-table he likes, but that will not be his fault. If the hon. the Minister is going to act as speedily as he says in regard to this particular problem of frontier commuters like the Kwa Mashu and Umlazi people in regard to trade unions, will he act against the trade unions in the meantime? This Bill gives the hon. the Minister powers to act against trade unions which have members who should not be members of those unions. I am now referring to the migrant and border area workers. According to the legislation, trade unions will have to root them out.</p>

                        <p>We will act benevolently towards the commuters but we will have to be very careful as regards the contract workers. The contract workers actually pose a problem to my Department.</p>

                        <p>I think the hon. the Minister should make this quite clear so that it is on record. He has said that he is going to act speedily to correct or to find a solution to this particular problem of the commuters. I am talking about the people who live near the big urban areas in places such as Kwa Mashu, Umlazi, near Pretoria and elsewhere. I am not talking about the contract worker who may come from Mozambique, Malawi or somewhere else. Having established this point, I wish to ask the hon. the Minister a further question. In terms of a clause in this Bill with which we will be dealing soon it will be illegal for a trade union to have members who are in fact commuters, for example, people who are residents of Umlazi. This is one of the problems. Having said that, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is going to prosecute these unions who have commuters as members. He cannot solve the one problem without solving the other. I hope the hon. the Minister knows what I mean. This clause gives him very strong powers to act because commuters are not employees in terms of this clause. In terms of a later clause they are not allowed to be members of trade unions.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, when I spoke previously I omitted to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his appointment as Leader of the Other Place. I wish him many fruitful years. I can assure the hon. the Minister that I am very pleased that he retained the portfolio of Manpower and Development. Although we have differences of opinion in regard to certain clauses in this Bill, I can assure the hon. the Minister we have never got on better with any other Labour Minister during the reign of this Government, and I hope he will retain this position for many years to come.</p>
                        <p>We are going to oppose clause 3, and I shall not speak for long as I know the hon. the Minister is anxious to finish this debate this afternoon. We must object most strongly to the racial division in clause 3. This does not improve the position of the workers and, should workers in future decide to have a mixed union registered, numbers should not be taken into account. Although there is an amendment, I do not think it goes far enough. We would like the hon. the Minister to be sympathetic in future in a case where a mixed trade union applies for registration. The people belonging to the trade union will have agreed to it, they will have agreed to that principle and they will have become members under those conditions, and in these circumstances the racial aspect should be completely ignored. I hope that next year this provision will be deleted completely from the Act so that trade unionists will be able to decide for themselves what type of union they want, mixed or otherwise.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I want to tell hon. Senators that I have the formula here. When the numbers are too small, or when relations warrant it, the Minister will use his judgment. And what is a sensible Minister going to do in future? He will get the Manpower commission to go into the matter thoroughly and he will then decide how it is to happen after he has received advice in this connection. He will, within the framework of the Act and its objectives, the policy of his party and the attitude it has adopted, come to the decision which circumstances demand.</p>
                        <p>I do not want to say anything further about this, Sir, I just want to say that I accept the amendment and I believe that it will be applied with great circumspection in future. As hon. Senators know this is an amendment to a clause in respect of which there can be serious misunderstanding and emotionalism. I am particularly pleased that she has moved it without being too emotional about it because if we seriously disagree with one another, we may be aggravating a conflict situation that may arise in this connection. I content myself with what I have just said, therefore, and I believe that the way in which it will be applied will be of such a nature that we shall be able to maintain peace.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, in my Second Reading speech I dealt with clause 4 but the hon. the Minister omitted to reply to me. I told him the difficulty we were having in understanding the principle underlying provisional registration. I also told him that we were not opposed to provisional registration. However, I am afraid that people without any following will get registration and that they will go among the workers. In that way a great deal of chaos can be caused. An unhealthy position can arise. I think this is something that should have been gone into far more carefully before allowing people to register before they have any following whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>These people should not even have the right to go to the Industrial Court to serve on industrial councils. I should like to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to allow only the workers of fully registered trade unions to participate in industrial councils. I believe that all workers should have the right to participate in industrial councils but not those who are provisionally registered.</p>

                        <p>There is an amendment in respect of the proposed new section 4B, but I do not think it goes far enough. The hon. the Minister has given an undertaking that he will not prosecute unions. In terms of this proposed new section they can be prosecuted and fined R500 for each person who is not eligible for registration.

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, we need not argue any further because we shall not agree on this point. I tried a moment ago to explain in detail what we intended to do. Let us leave it at that. As far as the first part of the request of the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers is concerned, I am pleased that she accepts my point of view as I explained it across the floor of the House. She raised two points. The one deals with fines. It does not say that it has to be R500; it could be up to R500&#x2014;it could also be 5 cents. Precisely because there may be ample opportunity for a misunderstanding to arise, we shall be very careful not to fine people, left, right and centre or to act in a negative manner. After all it is not in the interests of either the department or the industry as a whole or the trade unions if we deal with the matter unsympathetically. I want to satisfy the hon. Senator on that score. As far as the technical point of whether R500 is not too high, is concerned, I can only say that it need not be R500&#x2014;it could be far less than R500. I trust the hon. Senator is satisfied with that.</p>
                        <p>The second point the hon. Senator raised&#x2014;she did not really make an issue of it&#x2014;was that of relationship. That matter has been cleared up by way of an amendment. It has already been discussed in the Other Place and I was satisfied to do it like that. I do not think we need argue that matter any further. Arguments are not going to bring us any further. [Interjections.] Do you really want to argue? Do you really think you can say anything that will influence me?</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I refer to the proposed new section 4B(2). The hon. the Minister said at an earlier stage and then repeated it that it was not intended to institute criminal proceedings in accordance with this provision. It is a bad principle to put into any legislation a criminal clause if there is no intention of enforcing it. It brings the law into disrepute. I suggest that the hon. the Minister should do something about that. If there is no intention to proceed in cases where the law is flouted then this provision should be deleted.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, it is not a question of having no intention to proceed, but we must be reasonable. I have tried to indicate that in the initial stages there will be occasions when the Minister and the department will have to argue about the implementation of the law. All i am saying now is that at the beginning the department will be lenient. We shall not try to prevail upon or force the trade unions; there will be a stage of explanation.</p>
                        <p>*After all, Sir, this is surely a delicate matter. Who is going to blunder in and throw people into gaol indiscriminately? Surely nobody governs a country like that. Surely we know that this is a delicate situation. We shall talk to the trade unions; we shall try to sort things out. It will be fine if everything goes well. Let me give an example: If a regulation is made to the effect that people may not travel faster than 100 kilometres per hour, surely one does not fine all those who do right from the start.

                        <p>Let me put it this way. In any labour situation, when a small group of workers of a different race group wants to join a trade union because their own numbers are too small to enable them to form their own trade union they would, according to law be able to join an existing trade union. It may happen that the actual formula of having too few members does not apply in all cases but that the question of ratio may nevertheless be a factor. The clause provides that in such a case they would be able to join. The hon. Senator now wants to know how it will happen. The Minister will act sensibly if he is confronted with such a situation in future. How will he do it? He will have the position investigated. He will want to know whether it is necessary; what is behind it; who the people are and whether they are qualified to decide and how viable it would be. Then he will say to the Manpower Commission which he has created: Look into the situation for me; negotiate with the people; talk to the other trade unions; find out what the best solution is and come back to me so that I can decide. That is how it will happen. The hon. Senator must not ask me now what will happen in future. We shall act within the framework of this clause. We shall probably act as I have just explained to you.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I still do not understand what the formula is. The amendment states&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">&#x2026; or that by reason of the ratio between the numbers of employees of the different population groups concerned it would be expedient to form a union in respect of more than one such population group,</block>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, may I just explain. Let us take a hypothetical case. In respect of the first part of the formula which covers those cases where the numbers are too small, let us take the case of 10 people who want to form a trade union, but 10 are too few for that purpose. Now they want to join a trade union with a membership of 5 000. Obviously it is ridiculous for 10 people to form their own trade union. But there are trade unions with a membership of between 20 and 30. Suppose you have a situation where 50 000 people belong to a trade union. Suppose, then, there is a group of 200 people which in itself is a sufficient number to establish a trade union. In terms of the first formula it would mean that the group would be unable to join because 200 is a sufficient number for the establishment of a trade union. But in terms of the second leg of the formula there would also be a kind of ratio. Although 200 are sufficient 
                            <i>per se</i> to form a trade union, 200 in proportion to 50 000 is rather an absurd kind of situation. Does the hon. Senator understand that?

                        <p>But that is not the kind of matter which the Minister can discuss with you at this stage. Why would the Minister, as far as these things are concerned, create machinery such as an industrial court and a manpower commission to deal with labour practices if he were expected at this stage to spell out what the various future possibilities are? That is why I am satisfied that the formula must remain as it is and that the definition be extended in this way because that makes it somewhat wider than it was. I then leave it in the hands of the people I have appointed to advise me after they had proper consultations on and had gone into the matter. In a debate such as this I do not think hon. Senators can expect the Minister to look too far ahead and to discuss a whole number of probabilities because that does not get us anywhere.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I am not going to argue with the hon. the Minister. I think he agrees with me that this is the job reservation clause. It retains job reservation enactments which at present exist; they are staying there for the time being. This is the way the clause reads. What it is in fact doing is that while section 77 of the Act is being repealed those job reservation provisions which at present are in existence, remain in force until the Minister repeals them. Obviously, on that basis I must object and move my amendment accordingly.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I do not want to detain the House. I just want to speak briefly on the question of freedom of association. The recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission, as I pointed out recently, gave a great deal of hope to many people, particularly the Blacks and the trade unions, and also to overseas people. The report received very good publicity and I think the hon. the Minister of Labour will learn from Prof. Wiehahn when he comes back that people overseas are adopting a different attitude, because the people whom I contacted were hopeful that we were now on the right road. We have accepted this Bill because certain principles contained in it are good, but as far as the question of freedom of association is concerned we have objected to the relevant clauses because they are bad.</p>
                        <p>We believe that integration should not be forced upon people, but where people decide of their own free will to join the same unions there should also be no objection to that. They should have the freedom of choice. Article 2 of the ILO Convention, No. 87 of 1948, which concerns freedom of association and protection of the right to organize, states&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Workers and employers without distinction whatsoever shall have the right to establish and subject only to the rules of organizations concerned, to join an organization of their own choosing without previous authorization.</block>
                        <p>The Wiehahn Commission&#x2019;s report states&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">The recognition of the right of employees to organize for the purpose of collective representation in dealing with employers presupposes that they shall be free to do so without restriction.</block>
                        <p>These are the principles, Mr. President, that I hope will be embodied in the final Industrial Conciliation Act after all the reports have been submitted to the hon. the Minister and he has had more time to study them. We were sympathetic to some extent today when the hon. the Minister explained his difficulties and particularly when he explained how sympathetically he will treat the cases in regard to exemption.</p>
                        <p>The commission&#x2019;s report states further&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Allowing only racially segregated unions would be a severe curtailment of freedom of choice. In other words, prohibiting mixed trade unions is wrong, but equally the enforcing of mixed trade unions would infringe the right not to associate.</block>
                        <p>The commission concluded, just as we do, that the question of membership is something that should be left to the workers to decide for themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Government has, in my opinion, made a wrong move on this issue of mixed trade unions. Our racial situation is delicate. For that very reason we believe that freedom of association should be permitted as this will develop a steady normalization of trade unions on non-racial lines in this country. I cannot understand how the hon. Senator Dr. Visser, for instance, can be of the opinion that we will be able to retain this separation for ever, or the present 
                            <i>status quo</i>, because we can never do it. We can all see what is happening around us and in my opinion we should make the necessary changes, particularly in the labour field, so that we can enjoy a better future than our friends around us.
                        </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this step by the Government detracts immensely from the positive changes in the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission. If we fail to meet the criteria of the ILO, the world trade union movement, our trade unions and the Blacks will not accept the position. There will always be ill-feeling. I hope that the hon. the Minister will have more time during the recess to consider all these matters and that he will come forward with better legislation next year.</p>
                        <p>As stated in the 
                            <i>Sunday Times</i>, if the present leaders are not successful in co-operating with the Government in an effort to get Black trade unions established, as they have the right to do now, extremists will take over. That is what we must try to prevent at all costs. That is also the reason why I stated during the Second Reading debate that the present registered trade unions could only have a good influence on mixed trade unions and would be able to establish a sound relationship basis in this country, while the moderate forces of multiracialism were being crippled by provisions such as we have in the present Bill. I do not want to go any further, save to say that I hope that next year we will be able to pass a far better Bill.

Then they had the report of the Riekert Commission, another report which has so much positive to say. In other words, these reports did not condemn the Government outright and say that everything it had done over 30 years should be thrown overboard and scrapped. In fact, they were good and positive reports, and the Minister must admit this, because they built on existing legislation. They did not say that everything had to be thrown out but that we should take what we had and build on it. But a certain man called Paulus in the Transvaal mutters a few words and the hon. the Minister says on TV that he only represents about 2% of the work force &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>The hon. the Minister made some very nice noises. I almost clapped when I saw him on TV making that statement. I thought that we were now going to get somewhere, that we were going to get the legislation and that we would be on the right path. But what happened? We get the printed legislation before us and it is meek and timid and could have been written in a convent. This is really what it amounts to. I am bitterly disappointed that the Government, the hon. the Minister and hon. Senators opposite, did not have the courage to grasp the nettle and to do something about it. But, no; we are going on and we are preserving that bit of job reservation that still exists just in case we hurt a few people and we are going to have trade unions which exclude migrant workers from outside our borders because we may create an international incident if we have problems with them. I really am in despair. We received these two excellent reports, offering us something positive, and the Government does not have the courage to do anything worthwhile about it except to make some cosmetic changes. I am most disappointed with them and will vote against the Third Reading. I do it with reluctance because I really thought my friends opposite were going to show their teeth for a change and really get stuck into this problem.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this legislation. I also want to draw the attention of hon. Senators opposite to the fact that years ago when the Labour Party was in power, the NP always took the labour community in this country into consideration. That is why the National Party is in power today. Hon. Senators opposite who today belong to the same party as the hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers have always opposed her principles over the years. We and the kindred spirits of the hon. Senator Scheepers, together, started to form the government of this country. In the &#x2019;twenties we co-operated with the Labour Party in placing much of our labour legislation on the Statute Book. Over the years we have remained in power. The only time when hon. Senators opposite co-operated with the Labour Party was during the war years and then the Labour Party declined under them. When the NP came into power again we governed so well that the Labour Party disappeared completely from the scene. If there is any party that knows how to look after labour matters in this country, then it is the NP. Our colleagues opposite are the representatives of big capital in this country and that is why they are sitting there. We are on the government side because we act in a responsible way towards the labour community. We have had fewer strikes in this country over the past 50 years, thanks to the legislation introduced by the first NP Government, than any other country in the world. We now realize that certain adjustments have to be made to our labour legislation as a result of the new tendencies that have manifested themselves in the social sphere and the field of labour. This legislation is another step forward, but it is a step in the right direction. Ours is not a static party. Ours is a dynamic and developing party but we are not going to extremes like insane people; we go forward step by step as circumstances demand. Circumstances demand that we come forward with this legislation today. We accept it but this is not the final step. The laws of the NP Government are never final. Ours is an evolutionary party and to the extent to which the county develops and to which circumstances demand, we amend the laws and introduce new legislation. We want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this legislation and we trust that we shall have the same labour peace and quiet in the new era we are entering as we had in the past.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I must contain myself so as not to make a long speech so late in the afternoon. I am very grateful that we have got as far as this and there are only two things I should like to say now. Hon. Senators Opposite confront me with the Wiehahn commission report; they tell me that it is a good report and that we should do what it says. To that I just wish to say this: It is a good report, and it was a good commission. I appointed it myself. But I want to add this: The commission does not govern the county, the NP governs the county. That is the first point.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, if we have to decide, and if I have to decide, then I can choose one of two groups to take along with me. The first is the ILO which is established overseas and the other group consists of the members of the trade unions in my own country&#x2014;my own people. And if I have to choose, I choose my own people. I need say nothing further. That is the point we have reached.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>Some time ago the Government, with a view to the better utilization of manpower and as a result of the needs of industry, appointed an interdepartmental committee known as the Naudé Committee. The terms of reference of the committee were to inquire into and report on the training and retraining of Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics in industry, particularly on the level of operators and the higher category of semi-skilled workers. The training of apprentices in terms of the Apprenticeship Act, 1944, was not included in the terms of reference.</p>
                        <p>One of the recommendations of the committee was that if the industries themselves established training schemes for their White, Coloured or Asiatic workers, the State, just as in the case of the training of Black workers in terms of the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act, 1976, should render financial assistance such as tax concessions in regard to the schemes. This recommendation was accepted by the Government.</p>
                        <p>A need for training for that part of the labour force that has not had some or other form of artisan&#x2019;s training has been experienced for a considerable time. In 1976 a start was made to fill this need when the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Act was placed on the Statute Book. However, the White and Coloured trade unions alleged that employers, as a result of the implementation of the Act that makes provision for the training of Blacks, are giving preference to the employment of Blacks because employers receive tax concessions on their training expenses and are also able to acquire a better equipped and more productive worker at a low cost. From a training point of view, of course, the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Act only benefits Black workers. If the benefits of the latter are not also made available in regard to the training of Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics, it may be regarded as giving preferential treatment to one population group.</p>
                        <p>According to the last manpower survey of the Department of Labour of April 1977, 12 665 Whites, 10 738 Coloubeds and 2 274 Asiatics were employed as operators and semi-skilled workers in the building and/or construction industry alone. Consequently there is no doubt that the industrial sector, and possibly the commercial sector as well, could benefit greatly if their non-skilled workers could receive the necessary training to enhance their usefulness, productivity and skill in the work situation. We are all acquainted with the fact that increased production and the better utilization of manpower contributes a great deal to strengthening the economy of a country.</p>
                        <p>The Bill was drawn up in consultation with organized commerce, industry and the trade unions. Organizations such as the South African Employers&#x2019; Consulting Committee on Labour Matters, Saccola, and trade union federations such as Tucsa and the Confederation of Labour pledged their support for the measure.</p>
                        <p>On 28 March this year my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance indicated in his budget speech in the Other Place that these concessions would amount to R10 million in a full financial year. Provision for the granting of tax concessions to employers who provide Blacks with training in terms of the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act are already contained in the Income Tax Act. Similar provisions will be made in this year&#x2019;s Income Tax Bill if the Bill which is now before the House is passed.</p>
                        <p>I now want to explain a few of the important clauses of the Bill to hon. Senators.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, I want to refer to the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; in clause 1. As I have already mentioned, the purpose of this legislation is to train only Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics on the level of operators and the higher category of semiskilled workers in particular. As you will note, the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; excludes Blacks who are receiving training in terms of the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act from the Application of the Bill because there is existing legislation for them. When the Bill was introduced in the Other Place apprentices and artisans were also excluded. However, after the Bill had been introduced I received urgent representations from employers and trade unions for the inclusion of apprentices and artisans. Therefore I effected an amendment in the Other Place to include these categories of workers so that employers can claim tax concessions on the same basis as that which holds good for Black workers in terms of the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I want to draw your attention to the definition of &#x201C;training&#x201D;. Employees will be provided with training to make them better equipped for any work in or related to the industry in which they are employed. However, when the Bill was introduced, training provided in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act was also excluded from the Bill.</p>
                        <p>As far as the latter exclusion is concerned, I also received representations requesting that schemes under the Industrial Conciliation Act should be included. The reason for these schemes initially being excluded was so as not to encroach on the autonomy of industrial councils. Judging from the representations which were received, employers would rather fall under the legislation which is now being discussed so that they may claim tax concessions similar to those which apply to Black workers under the Black Employees&#x2019; In-Service Training Act. Consequently I effected a suitable amendment in this connection as well.</p>
                        <p>However, I want to address a timely word of warning to employers who fall under the schemes in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act not to claim double tax concessions if they are now included under this legislation as well. This matter will also be brought to the attention of the hon. the Minister of Finance, so that he may take action if this should be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, clause 2 of the Bill makes provision for the establishment of a Council for In-Service Training and clause 3 for the constitution of the council. The council will consist of 13 members. Two officers of whom one will be the chairman and one the vice-chairman will represent the Department of Labour, and one officer will represent the Department of Inland Revenue. In addition, five persons will represent the interests of employers and five persons the interests of employees. Alternate members may also be appointed. The period of service and remuneration of the members of the council are also being stipulated in this clause.</p>
                        <p>The procedures to be adopted when meetings of the council are held, for example the voting procedure, are set out in clause 4 of the Bill.</p>
                        <p>Clause 5 makes provision for the powers and functions of the council and committees that may be appointed by the council. The council will advise me as Minister of Labour on matters of policy, the promulgation of regulations and any other matter relating to the training of employees in terms of this Bill.</p>
                        <p>In clause 7 provision is being made for the registration of training schemes and the conditions which may be imposed on registration by the registrar. If the registrar should refuse to establish a scheme, the employer in question may appeal to me as Minister of Labour against such refusal.</p>
                        <p>Clause 8 deals with the registration of private centres for training. The clause also contains a prohibition on the training of employees of one person by another person except at private centres registered by the registrar. Furthermore, the clause provides that the registrar, after consultation with the council, may impose conditions on the registration of a private centre, may grant assistance&#x2014;except financial assistance&#x2014;to such a centre and may, after consultation with the council, withdraw the registration of such a centre. If the registrar should refuse to register a private centre, an appeal may be lodged with me as Minister of Labour.</p>
                        <p>I now come to clause 11. This clause empowers me as Minister to grant exemption from the provisions of clause 8(1) of the Bill. This means that exemption may be granted, that the employees of another person may be provided with training and that training need not necessarily be provided at a registered training centre.</p>
                        <p>The other clauses, which I have not specifically elucidated, deal with the administration of the Act. They are clause 6, relating to the appointment of the Registrar and Assistant Registrar of Training Schemes; clauses 9 and 10, which contain provisions relating to the appointment of inspectors and their powers; clause 12, relating to secrecy; clause 13, in terms of which regulations may be made; and clause 14, which contains the penal provisions.</p>
                        <p>As I have already mentioned, a Black Employees&#x2019; In-service Training Act already exists. If the recommendations of the Riekert Commission on this Act are accepted by the Government, recommendations which amount to the administration of the Act being transferred to the Department of Labour, thought will have to be given to the consolidation of the legislation with the existing Act, and problems which are already being experienced in the application of the existing Act and any further problems which may arise from this legislation, will be taken into consideration at such a consolidation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, the Bill constitutes great benefits for all, i.e. for employers as well as for those employees who ought to receive further training. I trust that it will receive the support of this hon. House.</p>
                        <p>As this is such wonderful legislation, I trust that we can dispose of it without discussion.</p>

                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">Dr. A. E. P. SCHEEPERS</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister was right in saying that this is good legislation. Employers and trade unions have been looking forward to it for many years. When the legislation in connection with the training of Blacks was passed, Coloured and White workers felt that they had been cheated because no tax exemptions were granted in respect of their training. Consequently employers were reluctant and problems arose. Therefore we are very pleased that this legislation has been introduced. I had serious objections because it would not have been possible to train artisans or skilled workers but because the Bill was amended in the Other Place, my objections have fallen away. As we all know there is a serious shortage of skilled workers during the present recession. Our country is very rich in many respects, with the exception of oil. We have a large labour force but we have to use that force to the fullest extent. If we do not train our workers, we shall fall behind and that is why I think that all our workers should be trained, irrespective of race or colour.</p>
                        <p>As far as training is concerned, our experience has been that workers usually preferred to be trained in that direction in which they would be able to find employment. The clothing industry in the Transvaal had a training college and there we found that the majority of the managerial staff were Whites, and there were also a few Indians.</p>
                        <p>However, I want to refer to something which the hon. the Minister should definitely pay attention. It happens sometimes that in an area where training should be provided the number of people belonging to one specific racial group are insufficient to justify the establishment of the necessary training facilities because the services of a properly qualified person at a high salary are required to provide that training. I agree with the recommendation of the Riekert Commission that the two acts should be amalgamated and that both should fall under the Department of Labour. I think the hon. the Minister will remember that I have on previous occasions expressed the opinion that labour matters should fall under the Department of Labour and not under various departments because various races are involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, if we want to make the fullest use of our labour force&#x2014;and that is absolutely essential&#x2014;we shall have to spend a great deal of money on training. The hon. the Minister mentioned a figure of R10 million, but if we were to spend R10 million or even more on the proper training of our labour force it would be one of the wisest investments we ever made. We shall be reimbursed many times over in the form of higher taxation to be paid by both the employers because of increased profits and the employees who will earn higher wages because of their increased proficiency.</p>
                        <p>We definitely support the principle contained in this legislation, and I trust the hon. the Minister will tell us in his reply whether he intends to consider the amalgamation of the two acts during the recess. When industrial organizations establish training centres, I believe that they should be allowed to train all the workers they require. Some industries may perhaps need more workers from a specific race group, for example, industrial organizations in the Cape Province would perhaps train more Coloureds, but where neither White nor Coloured labour is available, they will also have to train Black labour. I think these matters should be gone into thoroughly because there should be no stumbling blocks as far as training is concerned, for example because a certain group is too small to justify their being trained. Workers work together in the same industries, on the same floor, they operate the same machinery and they accept that. As long as the rate for the job is paid and the responsibility is the same, there are usually very few complaints. I believe, therefore, that the hon. the Minister should consider that matter very carefully.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I trust that we will train enough people to enable us to increase our productivity considerably because hitherto it has been very low. It has only been during the past few years that attention has been given to the training of workers. Whatever the nature of the work to be done, whether it be at the professional or ordinary labour level, or operational or managerial level, people have to be trained for it, and only then will they produce the best results. The National Productivity Institute has found that it is of the utmost importance that those in managerial positions should be properly trained. Usually there are inadequate facilities at training centres to train a sufficient number of workers for all the industries and that is why I think that workers should be trained in a specific industry and after that there should be in-service training, thus enabling those workers to teach other workers the skills they have acquired.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I would just like to have certainty as regard the amalgamation of the two Acts and the manner in which training will take place. However, we approve of the principle and we support this legislation.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want to make a few brief remarks. This legislation deals with the creation of machinery whereby in-service training will function properly, and it also aimed at exercising the necessary control. 
                            <i>Inter alia</i>, it provides for the establishment of the council, to which the hon. the Minister has referred, a registrar, as well as inspectors to exercise the necessary control. Therefore the Bill envisages a smooth and effective system of in-service training.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. President, just a few ideas on the value of training. The previous speaker has already elaborated on that. It will be difficult to overestimate the value of train ing and in-service training. We know that increased salaries are continually being paid to meet the increased cost of living and so on. One of the great problems of our day is inflation and that is aggravated if higher salaries are paid without there being increased productivity. And increased production can in turn to a large extent be obtained by better training.</p>
                        <p>It is a pleasure for me to support this legislation on behalf of this side of the House.</p>

I am sure you will maintain authority in this Upper House with great distinction and I trust that your term of office will be long and fruitful.</p>
                        <p>Venda&#x2019;s becoming independent will have certain consequences as far as the application of the Unemployment Insurance Act is concerned. The position will be as follows&#x2014;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(1) The Act will no longer be applicable in Venda from the date on which Venda becomes independent.</li>
                            <li>(2) Employers who fall under the definition of &#x201C;employer&#x201D; in section 4 will be excluded, and their and their employees&#x2019; liability to be contributors will cease.</li>
                            <li>(3) In terms of section 41(1)(h) of the Act persons who are outside the Republic are not entitled to receive benefits, and from the date on which Venda becomes independent, no payment of benefits there will be possible.</li>
                            <li>(4) Employees who are recruited on contract in Venda for service in the Republic and who have to return to their country on termination of their service will, as in the case of citizens of all foreign countries, be excluded from the definition of &#x201C;contributor&#x201D; in terms of section 2(2)(a).</li>
                            <li>(5) Inhabitants of Venda who do not render a service under contract in the Republic and who do not have to be repatriated upon termination of their service, will be contributors unless they are otherwise excluded from the definition of &#x201C;contributor&#x201D;, just as in the case of all persons in the Republic.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Mr. President, the question which arose was what obligation there should be towards contributors who are resident in Venda in respect of ordinary unemployment benefits, maternity benefits and illness allowances when Venda becomes independent, and what steps ought to be taken. As hon. Senators know, benefits from an unemployment insurance fund serve as a temporary source of income to assist the worker until he can find work again. With a view to a gradual transition stage the Government felt that the 
                            <i>status quo</i> should be maintained for a period in order to prevent disruption and dissatisfaction in respect of workers who have been contributors and have built up credits prior to the date of independence. During the transitional period the Venda Government can then de cide what its own wishes are in connection with the establishment of an unemployment insurance fund for its territory.
                        </p>
                        <p>Certain proposals on the application of the Unemployment Insurance Act after the date of independence were submitted last year to the working committee which was appointed to undertake the necessary preparatory work on the coming independence of Venda. These proposals were accepted by the Venda Cabinet. The proposals are embodied in the Bill which is now before this House.</p>
                        <p>This legislation is simply consequential legislation as a result of them becoming independent of Venda. It follows precisely the same pattern of the two Bills that were introduced here in the case of Bophuthatswana and Transkei and that were adopted unanimously. This legislation is agreed legislation between the South African Government and the Government of Venda which is shortly to receive its independence.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I want on this occasion to wish you God&#x2019;s richest blessings in the task that has fallen to you. I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>This Bill deals with a large variety of matters of which I shall mention only the most important here.</p>
                        <p>In clause 2 the powers of commissioners are extended to enable them to enforce their authority and the dignity of their courts irrespective of the race or colour of the transgressor.</p>
                        <p>Clause 3 provides for the fines which are recovered to accrue to the institution charged with the implementation of the provisions concerned. This clause is linked to clauses 4 and 9.</p>
                        <p>The new scales which are decreed under clause 10 are based on existing income tax tables applicable to married persons with a family of three children. The average married income tax payer has 1,7 children. While the annual tax of R2,50 was abolished in 1978, this is another step towards achieving the Government&#x2019;s aim of eliminating any disparity in taxes payable by people of different population groups.</p>
                        <p>The Black States are already recovering considerable amounts in general sales tax in their territories on behalf of the Government. As the taxes are being paid almost exclusively by Blacks, it is right that this money should accrue to the Governments of the Black people concerned.</p>
                        <p>The amendments in clauses 13, 14 and 15 have become necessary to give meaning and content to the granting of functions to community councils. The provisions contained in clause 16 have become necessary because it has appeared that regulations promulgated for all the community councils in the area of a particular Administration Board create problems in the case of new boards established after the date of promulgation of the regulations. The amendment ensures the stability of bodies which were established in a proper manner.</p>
                    </speech>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, it is my pleasant duty this afternoon to wish you well in the new position to which you have acceded today, to repeat what my Leader said in the formal proceedings which preceded these proceedings this afternoon and to say that we will promise you on this side of the House our fullest co-operation in carrying out what sometimes can be a most onerous duty. We wish you well and we congratulate you on your promotion to this high post.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the legislation before us and I must hasten to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister how much we appreciate the comprehensive explanatory memorandum that we received from his Department. This will, of course, facilitate this debate and will make the passage of this Bill through this House a lot smoother.</p>
                        <p>I must say that we have here a Bill which is rather like the curate&#x2019;s egg because it is good in parts and very bad in a particular part. We have had to consider our attitude towards the Bill at this Second Reading stage where we should be considering the principle embodied in it. But there is, as you know, Sir, no one principle embodied in this Bill. When we have this sort of situation it makes it a lot more difficult for an Opposition to decide precisely what attitude it should adopt at Second Reading.</p>
                        <p>We find in the Bill provisions which will improve the standard of life in Soweto. We also find concessions that are made to Africans regarding the amount of income tax that they should pay. We find an extension of the powers of community councils. Regarding these, I wish to pause for a moment and to say that there are certain anomalies which appear when one reads clauses 13, 15 and 16 of the Bill. In fact, there are even contradictions. It is all very well in clause 13 for the hon. the Minister to say that the community council is precluded from making regulations and yet he ties his hands by providing that he is compelled to publish regulations at the request of a community council. I can only say to him: &#x201C;A rose by any other name &#x2026;&#x201D; because community councils are in fact being given that power. The hon. the Deputy Minister is shaking his head. I am not fighting with him; I welcome that fact. If he had come with a Bill which had said that he would not be compelled to accept their ruling then I would have been fighting with him. But this afternoon I am agreeing with him and I am congratulating him for it.</p>
                        <p>There is also something of importance in the last clause of the Bill, namely the change in the name of the department. Speaking personally, the Department of Plural Relations and Development never meant anything to me. I find that among Africans themselves it meant nothing. But many hurtful jokes have been made in a play on that name and on the intention behind the name. I sincerely hope that the Department of Co-operation and Development is now going to rid itself of that stigma that attached to the name of the Department of Plural Relations and Development and that from now on we can get around to true co-operation with and the true development of the Black people of our country.</p>
                        <p>Now, Sir, having spoken of the good parts of this Bill, I come to clause 5 which really embodies no principle because the principle of an offence, viz. employing somebody contrary to the influx control regulations, is already embodied in the Act. But we have the situation where we have a massive increase in the penalty to be applied to anybody who may be convicted of the offence of employing or harbouring or keeping an African within an urban area without the necessary permission. Only two short years ago, i.e. 1977, we doubled the fine from R50 to R100, and today we are being asked not to double or to redouble but in fact to increase this fine from R100 to R500. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister with tears in my eyes why the Government always adopts this attitude? Why have they not tried to encourage employers to register their employees, to get the co-operation of employers instead of wielding the big stick? That is what we are being asked to do here this afternoon and, as I have said, this has made it difficult for us to decide how to deal with this Bill at the Second Reading. But having weighed the Bill up, we believe that it contains so many advantages for the African people in this country that we will support the Second Reading of this Bill. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will consider our amendments at the Committee Stage, particularly the amendment we shall move to negative clause 5 of the Bill.</p>
                        <p>With those few words I tender our support for this measure.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, in the first place I should like to congratulate you most heartily from the floor of the House. This has already been done by the Leader of the House and it has also been done by the other side. I should like to congratulate you most sincerely on your election to this very high office of President of the Senate. In terms of the Constitution you are not only President of the Senate but you will also act as State President. We should like to congratulate you and Mrs. Kruger and we wish you a very fruitful term of office.</p>
                        <p>The Bill before the House is an amending Bill; in other words, it is not a Bill with a definite theme or a definite principle. It is a Bill which amends or repeals certain laws. Laws which have become superfluous are repealed and others are amended. As the respective amendments relating to various laws streamline the administration of a very, very complicated portfolio, it is a great pleasure for us to support this amending Bill. The Bill amends certain laws in respect of which it has been found over the years that there are shortcomings that must be rectified. The Bill now before this hon. House does this, and we on this side have pleasure in supporting the amendments that are proposed here.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. President, I should like to say that in view of what we have learnt during the past week, this is probably the last occasion on which the hon. the Deputy Minister will be appearing here. It is my privilege to say here today that I have known him for many years, and I should like to express our deepest appreciation to him on this occasion for the manner in which he has dealt with legislation in this hon. House. We have the highest regard for it. We do not know what his future position will be but it is our wish that just as he has always dealt with legislation in such a precise fashion in this Upper House so he will carry out his future tasks with great dedication and great application in the service of South Africa. We wish him everything of the best. Mr. President, we have pleasure in supporting the measure before the Upper House.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat in regard to the last remarks he passed regarding the departure of this hon. Deputy Minister. As he said, there have been a number of changes in the past few weeks in this Parliament. Of course, the big change we are looking for is that all the Ministers should go; perhaps we shall be fortunate enough to see that one day. But we are thankful for small mercies when they go one at a time and are replaced. But despite that, Mr. President, I wish the hon. the Deputy Minister everything of the best in whatever he is going to do. I am not quite certain what it is, but I hope that he has a fruitful and happy career there.</p>
                        <p>It is unfortunate that he should take his leave of the Senate with a Bill of this nature. My friend, the hon. Senator Webber, in referring to a particular clause of the Bill said it brought tears to his eyes but that he would vote for the good parts of the Bill at the Second Reading. I am afraid, Mr. President, that the tears it has brought to my eyes compel me to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill regardless of the good that it does contain. There is no question that it does contain a fair amount of good&#x2014;or a great amount of good, depending on where one is sitting&#x2014;but the major drawback to me is so important that I cannot lend myself to record support for this legislation. I refer to the point already mentioned by the hon. Senator Webber, viz. the drawback contained in clause 5.</p>
                        <p>I shall deal with that clause in a little more detail at the Committee Stage because, as has already been said, this is really a Committee Stage Bill and it is not a matter of a particular principle. I want to stress very strongly that the only way to record my objection to the legislation because of this obnoxious clause, despite all the good the Bill otherwise contains, is to vote against the Second Reading.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>And after 55 years today is the last day on which there will be a Vosloo in this Parliament. We have all been related to the same family.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, I want to say a few words as far as this debate is concerned. I can assure the hon. Senators Webber and Winchester that it is not an easy thing to do to increase the severity of a law. That is the last thing that I want to do. As far as the administration of Black people in White South Africa is concerned we would be only too pleased if it were unnecessary for us to have inspectors to check on the position. Unfortunately, employers do not observe the law. The fines were increased in 1977. They were not increased to get at the employers but in order to protect the Black man. I want to ask hon. Senators whether they think it is fair towards the Black man who is registered to be employed in a certain area to force him to compete with a Black man who is in that area illegally? Is it fair on the part of an employer to employ somebody on a loose footing without providing him with housing and without paying any levy for the benefit of the whole community? I just want to quote one short paragraph from the Riekert Commission&#x2019;s report to show how unscrupulous some employers are. I read from page 166 where influx control is dealt with. I quote paragraph 4/199&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">These persons are on the whole not deterred by the possibility of clashing with the law or being sentenced to a fine or imprisonment. Employers are prepared to run the risk and are not deterred by the way in which the penalty provisions for unlawful employment are now applied. According to witnesses, some contractors even make provision in their tender prices for the payment of fines in the case of prosecution and save themselves the trouble of clarifying the position of Black workers with the labour bureau. This group of unlawful workers is not always properly housed and gives rise to various social problems, as also set out in paragraphs &#x2026;</block>
                        <p>*Mr. President, we do not want to play policemen, but this is for the sake of good order and also in the interests of the welfare of the Black people. The employers of those people who are illegally employed pay no levies; they do not contribute to the administration and the upliftment of the Black communities.</p>
                        <p>The other important factor is unlawful influx. Those people compete on the labour market with people who are already legally resident in White areas. The fine was increased in 1977 and at the end of 1977 the former Minister of Justice in collaboration with the then Minister of Bantu Administration and Development even went so far as to issue a circular in which it was stated that an admission of guilt would no longer be accepted. Thereafter each employer had to appear personally in court. This simply shows how much in earnest we are to establish an orderly process. I am sorry that hon. Senators are now shedding tears about this. I trust that my road ahead will not include tears as well.</p>
                        <p>Question put.</p>

                        <p>As fewer than five Senators (viz. Senator L. E. D. Winchester) appeared on one side,</p>

                    <p>Clause 5:</p>
                    <speech by="#webber">
                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, clause 5 is the one clause in this Bill that we consider to be absolute anathema. As I said during the Second Reading debate on this Bill, we shall oppose this clause and vote against it. We believe it is totally unnecessary. The fine which is provided for at the moment of a maximum of R100, is, I believe, an adequate deterrent to the employers of South Africa. I do not believe that fines of R100 have in fact been imposed by a court. I do not believe there have been any instances where an employer has been fined R100 per employee for employing persons who have not been registered. Therefore I do not believe it is necessary to increase the fine and I also believe that this is a wrong tactic that the Government is employing.</p>
                        <p>During the debate on the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Plural Relations and Development we on this side of the House appealed to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s colleague, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Plural Relations, to consider applying a moratorium on all employers who have employees who have proved themselves to be responsible, employees who have housing and who have all the necessary qualifications except the one qualification of registration with the board. We believed that in this way we would obtain the co-operation of thousands of employers throughout the country, and I mean thousands because I believe that there are thousands because I believe that there are thousands who are employing Africans at this stage &#x201C;illegally&#x201D; simply because of the provisions of the Act. Not for one moment am I pleading for the scrapping of the influx control regulations. However, we have the situation today where it happens repeatedly, particularly in Natal, where an employer has a Black employee and after he has proved his worth &#x2026; Let us start at the beginning, Sir. The reason why that employer has an illegal Black employee is not because he does not want to register him. There are those whom the hon. the Deputy Minister spoke about. I agree with him and if he were to thump those by R100 per employee &#x2026;</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>No, Sir, I am not discussing the principle. That is why I say I am not objecting at all to influx control regulations. It is their application which will result in this fine of R500 that I want to deal with. I believe that the time has come when the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department should administratively allow these people to register. Many of those are employed illegally because there were no suitably qualified or able Black people available at the time when those employers needed an employee. What happens, however, when the time comes when the employer says to the employee: &#x201C;Look, I must register you. Before I get fined R500 for having you here as an illegal employee I must take you to the office and have you registered&#x201D;? That employee leaves overnight, and the next morning the employer finds himself with no labour because that employee knows that he will not be registered. They will not allow him to register. The employer then again has the situation where he has to find a new employee. Invariably he finds that he has to look for him in the &#x201C;black market&#x201D; because he cannot find one through the legitimate market as a result of the zoning and all the other things which I cannot discuss under this clause. I want to agree with the hon. the Minister that there is an evasion of the levies. There is the question of housing. The last thing that we on this side of the House want is the total scrapping of the influx control laws.</p>
                        <p>We also had a commission and we also heard from the urban Black people that they want to maintain their own position. They want to keep out this influx of unregistered &#x201C;illegal&#x201D; people who come into the urban areas &#x201C;illegally&#x201D;. I believe that this is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to get the Co-operation by means of a moratorium of those employers who are responsible. Where there is a willing employer with a willing employee and where the employee has proved to be responsible, I believe that the Government should grant that moratorium. Mr. Chairman, we will vote against this clause.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to take this discussion any further in regard to this particular matter. However, what I am saying to the hon. the Minister is where he is now making the amount R500, for instance, is he aware of the difficulties that the amount that is already there causes the employer of labour? The hon. the Minister says the increase is to protect the legitimate worker or the workers who are in the cities legally, and that it is not directed against the illegal worker. This is the purpose of the increase from R100 to R500.</p>
                        <p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I do not believe that it is a protection at all. If one talks to the average employer of labour in this regard one finds that he has great difficulty in obtaining legal workers, the workers who are entitled to be there in terms of the Act. He already has difficulty in obtaining such a worker. He therefore employs somebody whom he then attempts to register and finds that the red tape attached to the registration of that worker &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>No, Sir. The point is that by increasing the amount from R100 to R500 the hon. the Minister is not going to achieve his objective. In fact, he is going to make it far more difficult than it already is. This is already a difficult section of the Act to administer, but I am not going to deal with that at all. I am saying that increasing the fine from R100 to R500 will not prevent the illegalities that take place under the Act at all because these difficulties are not going to disappear but will remain for other reasons. That is why I say, Mr. Chairman, that in no way could I ever support an increase of this nature. It will not work; it will not in fact achieve what the hon. the Deputy Minister is trying to achieve, and for that reason I must vote against it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not talk for long. The hon. Senator Winchester speaks of the very high fine of R500, but if he reads the legislation properly he will see that the maximum fine is R500 for a first offence.</p>

                        <p>Yes, at the moment, but in terms of this clause it is now being increased to R500. I know of only one case where the maximum fine of R500 was imposed. There are also cases where the courts have considerable jurisdiction in cases where people did not have prior knowledge of the provision or did not try to find out. But this is principally aimed at people who deliberately employ these persons. I accept that the hon.

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, the explanatory memorandum tells us in regard to clause 10 that the new tax tables that have been introduced for Blacks have been brought closely into line with the rates of taxation that would be applied to a taxpayer of another race group who is married with three children. Let me say right away that we will not vote against this clause because of the improvement that has been made in the tax scales. Employees who receive the lowest emoluments will now no longer be taxed. The ceiling has been lifted from R600 to R1 200 and we welcome that. But, Sir, when we consider another measure that is before this House, and we consider the recommendations of the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;and I am glad he is here to hear this&#x2014;regarding the taxation of Whites, Coloureds and Asians, then we find that the minimum taxation for a married person with three children is applicable to a person with an income of R5 000 per annum. That person will have to pay an amount of R86 in taxation. With the primary abatement, abatements for three children and allowing an amount of R400 in abatements for pension, medical aid, retirement annuity and insurances, that person would earn a taxable amount of R1 200 on which he would pay R86. A Black person earning R1 200 per annum would be required to pay R12 tax. That is on an income of R1 200 and I would suggest that the difference between R1 200 and R5 000 is such &#x2026; [Interjections.] I will sit down and give the hon. the Deputy Minister a chance to reply, Sir.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, the problem here is a question of phasing. First of all, Black taxation was abolished, and we are now trying to achieve a gradual equalization. There is still not parity. In this case, single Blacks pay far less than single Whites. But it is a gradual phasing and a further step will be taken so that disparity can be removed. This is not yet the final step.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I want to refer to page 10, subsection (3) of clause 10. [Interjections.] I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister has to leave and I understand that he wishes to take his leave of us now.

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I shall reply briefly. We could not anticipate the budget; that is why the two months are not repayable. It is physically impossible to trace more than three million taxpayers and repay a small amount to them. That is why subsection (3) reads this way.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Thank you. As the hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out, there is provision in this particular subsection that there will be no refund of the amount of tax which has been paid by Africans for the months of March and April and up to such time as the new tax tables are brought into effect. In this regard I want to point out two anomalies and I am glad that the hon. the Minister of Finance is here because I think he is involved in it as well. The hon. the Minister of Finance announced these changes in his budget speech three months ago. We now have the position that Parliament is only now, three months later, validating the announcements he made then. I wonder whether he should not look at the position so that we do not have this situation. The hon. the Deputy Minister has explained the practical problems with regard to the refunding of small amounts of tax to 3 million taxpayers. However, Parliament is now being asked to say that notwithstanding the fact that the hon. the Minister of Finance announced a reduction in the taxation rate in his budget at the end of March, here at the end of May those persons who have paid at the higher rates, the rates which were applied during the past tax year, are not to get a refund of the tax that they have overpaid. I put it to the hon. the Minister of Finance that this is not fair and I hope that he can look into this matter and find another way of doing it. With regard to Whites, Coloureds and Asians on the PAYE scales this gets adjusted at the end of the year when there is an assessment, but regarding the Blacks it does not happen. For that reason I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">(1) On page 10, in line 7, to omit &#x201C;not&#x201D;;</block>
                        <p>In other words, this amendment will entitle people to a refund of the amount recovered. I know that the hon. the Deputy Minister has practical problems in this matter but it will be up to the taxpayer to make his claim and to produce the proof that he has paid. Once he makes his claim and he produces the proof of his claim I believe one takes away the problems that arise out of this.</p>
                        <p>There is also a further matter regarding this particular clause. In subsection (2) it is provided that the provisions of subsection (1) shall be deemed to have come into operation on 1 March 1979. In subsection (3) we put right the anomaly of the overtaxation which has been paid by so many people. But the amount referred to there is only for March and April. I know that it was the intention that the new scales should be out for employers by May. But from my own experience and that of my son in Natal I know that people did not have the new tables for May, so that in fact these people have been charged at the higher rate for March, April and May. I submit that to put this right, it is essential that we should amend the Bill accordingly. Whether we accept that there shall be a refund or that there shall not be a refund I think that technically and legally the situation is such that we have to include May as well. For that reason I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">(2) on page 10, in line 9, to omit &#x201C;and April&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;, April and May&#x201D;.</block>

As far as the amendments of the hon. Senator Webber are concerned, there are a few practical problems to which attention must be given and I do not think it is possible to accept the amendments at this stage.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment that we were unable to persuade the hon. the Deputy Minister to reject clause 5 and to retain the penalty at R100 as we had asked him to do.</p>
                        <p>I have already expressed my congratulations and good wishes to the hon. Deputy Minister Vosloo on his departure from this Parliament and I wish to make only one point regarding the effect this Bill is going to have. Much good is going to flow from it, for example, the people of Soweto and their lights and the new powers that are being given to community councils. All those things are advantageous. Particularly in this time of economic pressure these people are going to welcome the reduction in the taxation. However, there is one thing that does concern me and which I hope the Minister responsible for this department and his officials will look into.</p>
                        <p>There is a tremendous incidence of bribery within the department, particularly regarding the registration of Africans. Experience has shown that the amount of the bribe is commensurate with the fine which is applied in the case of a conviction. I sincerely hope that this is not going to happen in this case because at the moment it is not only employers but the Blacks themselves who face the problem of bribery. The system of vulumlomo is a system which is applied by many Africans in authority and, I am sorry to say, by many Whites as well. This is the situation we face and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will, administratively through his department, keep an eye open for this to see that it does not happen in this case, viz. that we do not have an escalation not only of the incidence of bribes but also in the amount of the bribe that is demanded. Notwithstanding what I have just said, we will support the Third Reading of the Bill.</p>

                        <p>I feel so strongly about this particular clause that I am compelled to vote against this legislation, despite all the other good things in it, and as the hon. Senator Webber has said, there are many good things in it. But this particular clause is one that disturbs me so much that I must vote against it. I want to say that as I stated in my Second Reading mini-speech&#x2014;I deliberately kept it short because I knew the hon. the Deputy Minister who was handling the Bill had to leave and was in a hurry&#x2014;I took the opportunity of calling for a division on the Second Reading to express in the best way I could my objection to this legislation. But it would seem that my action was not popular with certain hon. Senators on the Government side. They felt that I should not have called for a division and that I was wasting the time of the House. I feel that that is in fact my right and my proper duty. It had been my intention to merely record my objection at the Third Reading, but in view of some of the remarks that were passed to me as a result of the division on the Second Reading, I intend to call for a division under the Third Reading to show my objection to this Bill and not necessarily to the remarks which were passed to me.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, it is a particular privilege for me to be appearing here in this hon. House today on a day which is a special day for you. I am sure that you have the background, both intellectually and academically, to make a great success of this post, and I want to wish you a very pleasant term of office in this capacity.</p>
                        <p>I should just like to say, Mr. President, that you appeared in the Other Place under my Speakership, and I hope that you treat me better here than I treated you there!</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, section 55 of our present Constitution and of its predecessor, the old South Africa Act, 1909, has often been the subject of widely divergent opinions concerning disqualification for membership of the Senate or Parliament. As a result of this Select Committees were appointed during the first session of Parliament last year as well as during the present session with the instruction to inquire into and report upon section 55(d) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961 (Act No. 32 of 1961).</p>
                        <p>I want to express my appreciation to the members of these Select Committees today, not only for the seriousness and dedication with which they viewed their task but also for the fearless objectivity they displayed.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the fact that I have come to this House today with a Bill which differs from the Bill proposed by the Select Committee, I want to give the assurance that the Select Committee&#x2019;s work has not been in vain. Owing to lack of time the committee&#x2019;s decisions and recommendations can neither be studied nor put into operation at this stage. The Joint Select Committee on the Constitution which is investigating a new constitution for the Republic, will indeed, however, take thorough cognizance of the Select Committee&#x2019;s decisions and recommendations. The Bill before the House at present must consequently be regarded as merely another interim measure since time has unfortunately caught up with us.</p>
                        <p>In terms of section 55(d) as it stands at present, any person who occupies an office of profit under the Republic is disqualified from being elected or nominated or sitting as a member of the Senate or the House of Assembly. However, a proviso has been added to section 55(d) in terms of which certain persons are not deemed to occupy offices of profit under the Republic. However, in view of the wording of section 55(d) doubt exists as to whether a member of a commission of inquiry appointed by the State President or the Administrator of a province falls under this qualification too. For that reason clause 1 of this Bill proposes that members of such commissions of inquiry be mentioned expressly under the qualification as well. It has also been deemed advisable to include members of Select Committees of the Senate and of the House of Assembly in the proviso in order to eliminate any uncertainty with regard to the members of Select Committees that may sit as commissions during a recess.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, the Offices of Profit under the Republic Amendment Act, 1978, was merely an interim measure and lost its protective effect on 31 May 1979. This means that serving members of the Senate or of the House of Assembly or of a provincial council to whom that Act relates, no longer enjoy protection since 31 May 1979. Clause 2 is phrased in such a way that a moratorium of 30 days is afforded those members to rid themselves of any disqualification that may still be attaching to them in terms of section 55(d). The onus rests on the members themselves to determine whether the provisions of section 55(d) still apply to them since 30 June 1979.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, the position of members of the various control boards instituted in terms of the provisions of the Marketing Act, 1968 (Act 59 of 1968), and members of the Board of Curators for National Parks appointed in terms of the National Parks Act, 1976, was discussed in depth with the Chief State Law Adviser, and I want to state here emphatically that members of such control boards, for example the Oilseeds Control Board, the Milk Board, the Wool Board, the Maize Board etc. as well as members of the Board of Curators for National Parks are employed by the board in question and are not in the employ of the Republic. Consequently they do not occupy offices of profit under the Republic and so the provisions of section 55(d) of the Constitution are not applicable to them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I also want to reiterate what I announced in the Other Place with the permission of my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, namely that he has decided to increase the daily allowance of R15 per day payable in terms of Government Notice No. 2192 of 23 November 1973 to a member of a board, committee or similar body appointed by or in terms of any law within the meaning of section 55(d)(vi), to R30 per day because, as we all know, there have been considerable increases in costs since November 1973. This increase will be announced in the

                            <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I believe I am the first Whip who has had the opportunity on the floor of this House to wish you well in your new high office. I do that with deep sincerity. I must be getting old, Sir, because I was thinking a little while ago&#x2014;I sometimes think!&#x2014;and I found that I have had the privilege of serving, in the course of my parliamentary life, under three Speakers, and that you, Sir, are the fourth President in this Upper House under whom I shall serve. I am sure, and I express this with great conviction, that you will in every way live up to the high position to which those predecessors of yours lived in the course of their period of office. We wish you well.</p>
                        <p>Coming back to the Bill, Mr. President, I want to say that it is obviously necessary and good that there must be a provision in our Constitution which excludes members of Parliament and of the Provincial Councils from occupying at the same time as they are members of Parliament and of the Provincial Councils, offices of profit under the State because there can obviously be a conflict of interest where such members occupy offices of profit under the State. The duty of members of Parliament&#x2014;that includes hon. Senators and, at another level, members of a provincial council&#x2014;is to attempt to control&#x2014; and I would like to impress this upon hon. Senators&#x2014;the executive. And if a member holds an office of profit under the State there is a conflict of interest between that office of profit and his duty to attempt to control the executive because, since time immemorial in fact, the whole parliamentary institution has been an institution that has sought to control either the monarch, the executive president or the executive. So clearly there is a need to exclude holders of offices of profit under the State, generally speaking, from holding situations as members of Parliament or of provincial councils as well. That need is clearly there and it is recognized by our Constitution in which it is embodied. On the other hand, Sir, there is clearly a need to make certain exceptions because one does not want to deprive the country and the State of the services of members of Parliament in various other spheres like commissions of inquiry, committees of inquiry, standing committees and standing commissions. That would be quite wrong. It would be wrong to deprive the State and the country of the services of members of Parliament in certain fields outside Parliament simply because they were parliamentarians. The problem is to find the correct dividing line. I know the select committee to which the hon. the Minister has referred, went a long way in their investigations in an endeavour to find the correct dividing line. Where does one draw the line? I am glad that the hon. the Minister paid tribute to that select committee. I believe it did very good work. I believe that its work has not been fruitless and that that work will receive further consideration. I am glad that that is so.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the Bill before the House, it is necessary as a bridging measure until the select committee&#x2019;s recommendations have received further consideration and are in turn translated into law. Therefore we shall support the Bill which the hon. the Minister has introduced.</p>

                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, before dealing with the legislation before the House, I should also like to express a few thoughts in regard to my association with you over the years and in regard to your new appointment.</p>
                        <p>I have had the privilege over a period of 14 years of working very closely with you as chairman and member of the Justice, Police and Prisons group in this House which, together with the same group in the Other Place, had many consultations with you. Throughout the years I have always admired your competence, your diligence, your insight and so on. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking you most sincerely on behalf of that group for the wonderful service you rendered. I could not do this at the last meeting of the group, Mr. President, because I do not think I was then aware of your elevated status and neither were the other members of the group.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, you have had a very active period of service. History shows that the Minister who occupies the Justice portfolio is really the person in the line of fire. In my view you have always handled the situation competently and carried out your duties successfully. I should like to express the hope that your service in this House will be long, happy and definitely more peaceful than was the case when you sat on the ministerial benches.</p>
                        <p>I should like to express a few thoughts on the legislation before us. The hon. the Minister has dealt very fully with the position. The hon. Senator Horak made some good points in connection with it. What often strikes me is that we have a Parliament in South Africa which does not even sit for a full half-year. In the meantime its business does not come to a standstill. The constitutional position in particular is very dynamic at this stage. It is a position which must be taken into account and considered carefully. Not only the constitutional position but very many other matters as well must be attended to during the recess and, because of the work done by commissions, the time taken up by business in Parliament will definitely be shortened by reports and so on which must be submitted. People with experience of commission work will realize that if we did not have a system of commissions in this country, and if the work, the taking of evidence and so on which commissions do, had all to be done by Parliament, we would probably have to sit from 1 January to 31 December, by which time, I fear, we would still not have finished. This is legislation the practical application of which will not involve the country in any additional expenditure. In fact, it will bring about a saving. I was pleased to hear the announcement of the hon. the Minister regarding an increase in allowances for the members concerned. The expenses of the members concerned, as the hon. Minister so rightly said, are a great deal higher than they used to be. When I was a member of the provincial council&#x2014;and I think the hon. the Minister arrived shortly after I had&#x2014;we received a monthly salary of £15 a month.</p>

                            <br/>In particular we pay tribute to you for the capable and dignified manner in which you carried out your onerous duties during the period you held these various offices. You gave inspiration at all times to every section of the population and set an example of devoted and selfless service to your country.
                            <br/>We also express our sincere appreciation to Mrs. Vorster for the exceptional contribution she has made to public life and for the charm and warm friendliness with which she assisted you in adding lustre to the high offices you have held.
                            <br/>We wish you and Mrs. Vorster a well-earned rest and we pray that with the blessing of Almighty God, you may both long be spared to our country.

                        <p>Mr. President, it is just not possible for the official Opposition to support the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the House. It is well known that when dealing with the various reports of the Erasmus Commission, the Opposition has frequently referred to the part played by the former Prime Minister in the Information scandal. We have been very critical of his role in this matter. Apart from that, in our view he certainly did the highest office in the country no service when in his position as State President he went out of his way to enter into a polemic in public with a retired former Minister. Accordingly we find ourselves in the position where we cannot under any circumstances support this motion and we shall be compelled to vote against it.</p>

If he really wanted to achieve what he said he wanted to achieve, he should have moved an amendment backdating the salary increase to yesterday. But he has not moved that amendment, and in any event we would not have supported that amendment either from these benches because we would have considered it petty.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House have no material objections to any clause contained in this Bill. The Bill embodies no principles. It deals with various matters which, as the hon. the Minister correctly said, are expounded in the explanatory memorandum.</p>
                        <p>As far as clause 18 is concerned, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could not furnish us with a further explanation. The hon. the Minister says in the explanatory memorandum that this amendment was inserted on the recommendation of the Select Committee on Public Accounts. The question we should like to have answered is why the Select Committee on Public Accounts was not brought into this amendment, because as we see it, this would have placed the matter beyond any doubt. As the clause reads at present, it is only after consultation between the hon. the Minister, the Auditor-General and the Prime Minister that it will be reported on or not. We feel that if we could have this matter referred to the Select Committee on Public Accounts and they could give it their approval or disapproval, the matter would be beyond all doubt. The Select Committee on Public Accounts is the body established to call to account and give account in this Parliament of the way in which money is spent in the public interest by the Parliament of South Africa. The hon. the Minister will agree with me in this regard. If the hon. the Minister can give us a satisfactory explanation, we shall be much obliged.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Swanepoel referred to clause 18 and I think what his question amounts to is whether the Select Committee should not also have a say in determining what should be left out of the Auditor&#x2019;s report. The position is in fact that the security of the State is the responsibility of the Executive, which will determine what information may be publicized when it is a matter of secret information. That, in fact, is the situation in a nutshell. In other words, as it is stated here, the decision would rest with the Minister of Finance after consultation with the Prime Minister, in the sense that the Prime Minister is the chief of State Security, and also after consultation with the Auditor-General, who is an officer of Parliament. He is directly responsible to Parliament and, of course, to the Select Committee itself. The clause provides then, that there must also be consultation with the Auditor-General, who represents Parliament. I do not think it would be advisable to go further than that in legislation. 
                            <i>Ad hoc</i> arrangements may be made to inform speakers on financial matters, as is in fact done in regard to other confidential matters relating to foreign affairs. I believe that the Minister of Finance ought in practice to have the right to decide on this in consultation with the Prime Minister. This ought not, in my opinion, to be prescribed in legislation. It is by no means the intention in this regard that the Select Committee should be excluded. However, where any report of the Auditor-General is available to the Select Committee, we felt that it was perhaps the most effective and practical way to do this. The Select Committee itself will then be able to report to Parliament, and Parliament can then decide how the matter should be taken further. I hope that will satisfy the hon. Senator.

                        <p>Yes, but if that is what will happen in practice, then that is sufficient reason to replace the word &#x201C;after&#x201D; with &#x201C;in&#x201D;, viz. &#x201C;in consultation&#x201D;.</p>
                        <p>Because if that is the case in practice, then I see no reason why the word &#x201C;after&#x201D; should be used and not &#x201C;in&#x201D;. That is the first point I want to raise.</p>
                        <p>The next point the hon. the Minister made is that 
                            <i>ad hoc</i> statements can be made to spokesmen on finance, and I take it that he means by the spokesmen of the various parties. I take it, too, that the statements will be made by the hon. the Minister or by an official of his department, because I do not believe the Auditor-General will do it. After all, that is the duty of the Minister of Finance.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, the fact is that spokesmen of the various parties who usually discuss finance are usually also those people who represent their parties on the Select Committee on Public Accounts. Therefore, what the hon. the Minister has in fact told me is that he will give information on an 
                            <i>ad hoc</i> basis to the chief spokesmen on finance of the various parties from time to time. What this will amount to in fact is that the same information can be furnished to the Select Committee on Public Accounts because it is after all with this committee that the Minister will discuss the confidential matters. I and my party realize that there are sensitive matters and projects about which we should prefer not to have leakages of information. However, I also have sufficient faith in the members of Parliament of South Africa to be satisfied that if they are trusted, they will not violate that trust, particularly where it could affect the security of our country.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I am therefore of the opinion that the amendment we have moved deserves the favourable consideration of the hon. House.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I doubt whether the hon. Senator&#x2019;s amendment is entirely satisfactory because it will place an obligation on the hon. the Minister of Finance whereas the clause as it stands gives him a discretion. If we are going to obligate the hon. the Minister of Finance to share confidential information with a field of people wider than he considers to be in the national interest, we will today be passing legislation which will be tantamount to endangering the security of the State. I think we must trust the hon. the Minister to use his discretion, as he has done in the past and will do in the future, to know when it is right and when it is not right to share such confidential information. I appeal to hon. Senators opposite to withdraw their amendment because I do not believe it is in the interests of the State to carry on with it.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I do not quite honestly understand the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter&#x2019;s argument with regard to the greater responsibility that the amendment seeks to place upon the hon. the Minister of Finance. In fact, the amendment reduces the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility in two ways. First of all, it brings the Select Committee on Public Accounts into consultation, so it makes his task a little easier, not more difficult. It brings an extra agency to the people who have to consult about this matter. Therefore, it lightens the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility and does not increase it. It may complicate it but it lightens the responsibility and the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter used the word &#x201C;responsibility&#x2019; &#x2019;.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it also lightens his responsibility with regard to his consultation with the hon. the Prime Minister. As this clause is worded now the Minister shall, after consultation with the Prime Minister, do various things. That means that if he disagrees with the Prime Minister he goes on and does those things despite the disagreement with the Prime Minister, which is a tremendous responsibility to place on the Minister of Finance. We are saying to him in this Bill &#x2026; [Interjections .] Yes, that is exactly the responsibility that is on his shoulders and that is why I do not understand the hon. Senator Poorter&#x2019;s argument. We are trying to help the hon. the Minister by saying &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D;, which means that they must both agree. We are trying to help the hon. the Minister and we do not want him&#x2014;well, perhaps we do, in practice&#x2014;to be fired. This amendment therefore seeks a lightening of the responsibility upon the hon. the Minister.</p>
                        <p>It also does something else. By seeking to bring in the Select Committee on Public Accounts it is trying to bring in an instrument of the legislature. It is taking this decision out of the field of the executive only. We know why Parliament is here and we know the history of the development of Parliament. It is a history of seeking to control the executive in matters of finance. King Charles I ultimately had his head chopped off because of this type of conflict between the executive, the monarchy in those days, and Parliament. It is Parliament&#x2019;s task and duty&#x2014;and probably its primary duty&#x2014;to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer in controlling the expenditure of moneys. By bringing the Select Committee on Public Accounts in here we are bringing Parliament into the picture. We are adding Parliament to the executive picture which is the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. In terms of the constitutional development of democracy I think that is a very sound principle and I will therefore vote for this amendment.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, we have given very close thought to this matter and I have listened very carefully to the hon. Senator Horak and other speakers. Let me say first of all that in practice in virtually all cases the Minister of Finance will want to do this in consultation with the Prime Minister. He is not going to look for points of difference and I think in practice this will substantially be the position, after consulting also with the Auditor-General. As I see it there is, therefore, no practical problem.</p>
                        <p>There is a legal view that there is in fact very little difference in law between the expressions &#x201C;after consultation with&#x201D; and &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D;. I am not competent to carry this argument too far but this is how it has been worded by the law advisers after long discussion. My own view is that as far as the formal wording is concerned it is probably right to say &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D; with the Prime Minister in that the Minister of Finance will have to take the final responsibility. I think this is correct in a matter of this kind. If it is a contentious matter and one which may lead to a lot of debate, I do not think the Prime Minister should be directly involved. The Minister of Finance will certainly give very careful attention to the way the Prime Minister feels and I am sure that he will go out of his way to accept it, but nevertheless I think that from a legal point of view the wording should be left as it is. That is also how the Treasury and the Auditor-General feel.</p>
                        <p>As regards the Select Committee on Public Accounts it must be borne in mind that the Auditor-General is an officer of Parliament who reports to Parliament. All we are doing here is saying that in really sensitive matters there ought to be a provision that a report he draws up can be submitted to the Minister of Finance who, in consultation with the Prime Minister and with the Auditor-General, may then decide that it is in the public interest or for reasons of national security that something should be left out. I think the amendment effected in the Other Place makes this position clear and its wording is better than the original.</p>
                        <p>To my way of thinking it will be more correct to leave this matter in the hands of the executive. Supposing a very difficult matter arises, what would the Minister of Finance do? He would take the matter to the Cabinet with the consent of the Prime Minister.</p>

                        <p>Yes, that is the executive. But you have the Auditor-General fully in the picture in that he draws up a report and is consulted as to whether something should be left out. By submitting this report to a committee of Parliament&#x2014;the Select Committee on Public Accounts is a committee of Parliament&#x2014;you certainly cannot say that you are bypassing Parliament. However, you are not saying that you are asking the Select Committee to have a part in the decision as to whether something should be left out I agree with that. But fundamentally, if it is a very difficult matter, I believe this would be a Cabinet decision. That is how we see it That is how the Treasury sees it and that is how the Auditor-General himself sees it. I do not wish to be dogmatic but I must say that I am persuaded by that point of view and as a result will find it difficult to accept the amendment.</p>

                        <p>This clause relates to 
                            <i>ex gratia</i> payments to individuals involved in the fatal train accident at Keetmanshoop. At the time of the accident those men were performing military service and we are therefore happy that their families should receive the payments that will now be made. One only hopes that this group assurance will cover this type of contingency as well. I should be obliged if this could be confirmed because I think it is a very important matter.

                        <p>Mr. President, at this stage I just want to say with regard to the clause which, as the hon. the Minister is aware, relates to matters which have dominated virtually our entire debate during this past session, that I should greatly appreciate it if the hon. the Minister and his law advisers were to take another look at this amendment we have moved. I did not want to prolong discussion of the matter during the Committee Stage. We took note of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s standpoint, and bandying arguments across the floor concerning minor technical points will make no difference to the arguments on principle which both he and I mentioned here. Unfortunately they are irreconcilable. But I hope the hon. the Minister will take another look at this and hold consultations on the matter. I am still convinced that our Select Committee on Public Accounts&#x2014;I use the phrase used a moment ago by the hon. Senator&#x2014;is for all practical purposes a responsible body which can share in the responsibility of decision-taking in regard to these matters. Apart from that, Mr. President, I believe that the decisions which the hon. the Minister will eventually take can be influenced by opinions advanced by these gentlemen. And perhaps the Minister could be beneficially influenced to take the correct decision relating to the report which the Auditor-General will publish. My opinion in regard to these matters is that it is only in the case of extremely sensitive matters that the report of the Auditor-General should not be published. For the rest, wherever possible, we should play open cards, not only with the Parliament of South Africa, but also with the public and the voters who send their representatives here.</p>

I appreciate the attitude of the hon. Opposition and the hon. Senator Swanepoel. As I have already said, I do not wish to be dogmatic, but that is our considered opinion at this stage. However, I am quite prepared to consult my senior officials, my colleagues and the Auditor-General again and have the matter investigated another time. I shall then in due course contact the hon.

                        <p>It is true that the so-called revenue laws, i.e. transfer duty, stamp duty, estate duty and the duty on marketable securities, no longer play the same role in the fiscal structure of our country as they did a century ago. Nevertheless, they remain valuable and indispensable sources of revenue for the State. Although it may not be a matter of great interest or offer much consolation to those who become liable to pay these taxes and who find that they have to make a contribution to the Treasury, it is nevertheless interesting that two of the levies, i.e. stamp duty and transfer duty, have a history which goes back to the centuries when the idea of a settlement at this southern tip of the continent of Africa was no more than a dream of our forefathers. Transfer duty virtually came ashore with Simon van der Stel and was first levied in South Africa in 1686, while stamp duty immigrated not long afterwards. Estate duty too is a tax which originated beyond our borders but it has been levied here in some form for so many years that it can no longer be regarded as a stranger. To abandon these well-proven and profitable forms of taxation at this stage would be foolish, but it must also be admitted that in order to retain its value any tax system has to keep abreast of changing times and circumstances. The object of this Bill, therefore, is of a two-fold nature: Firstly, it gives effect to the tax proposals I announced in my budget speech and, secondly, it introduces certain amendments which have become necessary as a result of changing circumstances. I may add that the latter amendments originated from representations received from inside as well as outside Parliament. Hon. Senators will readily understand that it has not been possible to accept all the proposals&#x2014;to have done so would have meant that no taxes whatsoever could be levied&#x2014;but where it has been at all possible to comply with reasonable and practical proposals, this has been done.</p>
                        <p>I shall now proceed, Mr. President, to discuss the various clauses of the Bill.</p>
                        <p>The Marketable Securities Act, 1948, provides for the levying of a tax with regard to every purchase of marketable securities by a stockbroker on behalf of someone else. In other words, it is a tax on transactions taking place on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The present rate of taxation is 1&#x00BD;% of the amount for which the marketable securities are bought. The amendment introduced by clause 1 reduces the rate of taxation to 1% of the purchase price of the marketable securities. Since the concession made in 1977, the effective rate of this tax is only 50% of what it was two years ago.</p>
                        <p>Clause 2 introduces two amendments to section 9A of the Transfer Duty Act, 1949. Hon. Senators will remember that in terms of the Sectional Titles Act, 1971, which came into operation on 30 March 1973, it became possible to obtain ownership of, for example, one flat in a block of flats. As far back as the &#x2019;forties, however, some people obtained the right to occupy flats permanently by buying so-called block shares in development companies. Section 23 of the Sectional Titles Act provided for the conversion of such rights of occupation into rights of ownership and, in order to enable the holders of block shares to avail themselves of this facility without paying an unreasonable amount in transfer duty, section 9A of the Transfer Duty Act provides that the amount of the transfer duty shall be based on the amount which the occupant of the flat paid for his block shares, as well as his share of the cost of drawing up the sectional plan. A further effect of the section is that transfer duty shall be calculated at the rate which applied on the date on which the block shares were bought. Because the implementation of the Sectional Titles Act was not expected to present any problems, the said section 9A allowed the holders of block shares a period of one year after the date of commencement of the Sectional Titles Act to make use of this concession. If they did not act in time, a penalty would be payable as from 30 September 1974 at the rate of 7&#x00BD;% per annum.</p>
                        <p>In practice, the Sectional Titles Act presented several initial problems with the result that few, if any, block shareholders made use of their rights in terms of section 23 of that Act and, as far as is known, no one benefited by the provisions of section 9A of the Transfer Duty Act.</p>
                        <p>The present provisions of section 9A now virtually prohibit the conversion of rights of occupation into rights of ownership, for even if the amounts of transfer duty are still reasonable a penalty is payable at the rate of 7&#x00BD;% per annum as from 30 September 1974. That is a period of one year after the date of commencement of the Sectional Titles Act&#x2014; which was 30 March 1973&#x2014;plus the six months&#x2019; grace allowed by the Transfer Duty Act. In addition, there is the fact that the rates of transfer duty have been considerably reduced since 1973, even to the point where in spite of today&#x2019;s increased prices, the value of some flats is low enough as to result in total exemption from transfer duty or to ensure, in any event, that the transfer duty will be considerably less than the amount, plus the penalty which would be payable in terms of section 9A if it were decided to obtain ownership.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, clause 3 introduces two amendments. In the first place, it extends the period within which it is possible to make use of section 9A, but without paying a penalty on transfer duty. This concession will benefit those who bought their block shares years ago at a low price. It must be noted that the conversion of right of occupation into right of ownership must take place before 30 September 1981 in order to avoid payment of the penalty.</p>
                        <p>The second amendment provides that the person who wants to have his right of occupation converted into a right of ownership can choose not to make use of the provisions of section 9A. If he does exercise a choice, the transfer duty will be determined in accordance with the usual rules, i.e. on the value of the property at the date of payment of the transfer duty at the rate applicable at that date.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I come now to the question of estate duty. This duty is levied on the taxable amount of any estate. The expression &#x201C;estate&#x201D; includes not only tangible assets such as immovable property, bank deposits, shares, etc. but also rights such as annuities and usufructs which pass to someone else on a person&#x2019;s death. In order to combat tax evasion, property which is deemed to have belonged to the deceased is also being brought into the ambit of the Act. Included in this category is a right to an annuity paid by a fund. This concept includes an annuity paid by a pension fund or a retirement annuity fund which wholly or partly survives the deceased and which is paid to another person&#x2014;usually his widow&#x2014;after his death. In such a case, the value of the annuity is calculated at 12% over the expected life of the annuitant, and the amount thus capitalized is included in the property of the deceased.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Wait a moment&#x2014;I have still to deal with a few other concessions. Representations have been made to my department and myself from time to time for the exclusion of this capitalized amount from the value of an estate. In many cases the inclusion of the amount is merely of academic interest because most pensioners who die do not have sufficient assets to make their estates liable for estate duty, especially if they were married and had children or when husband and wife were both elderly and the capitalized value is not great. There may be exceptions, however, and even though my department has not yet encountered the exceptional case of the man with a big pension and a young wife and children&#x2014;i.e. the case where the capitalized value may be great&#x2014;it is nevertheless possible that cases may come to light where the levying of estate duty on this right which passes to someone else at the death of a pensioner may cause hardship for the remaining spouse. I therefore propose that section 3(3)(a)
                            <i>bis</i> of the Estate Duty Act be amended to provide that the capitalized value of an annuity payable by a pension fund which has been approved for the purposes of the Income Tax Act will no longer be regarded as property which is deemed to be property of the deceased. The relevant amendment is contained in clause 3 of the Bill.
                        </p>
                        <p>You may well ask, Mr. President, why a similar concession is not being proposed in respect of annuities paid by retirement annuity funds. My reply to that is that there is a clear distinction between pension funds and retirement annuity funds as well as between the circumstances in which contributions are made to such funds. In the case of a pension fund, the employee usually has no choice. Membership is a condition of employment and his contributions are simply deducted from his remuneration. The employer adds his contribution and the total amount is then paid into the fund where it remains until such time as the employee reaches retirement age. If the former employee dies after having retired leaving a widow, the pension which survives him and which passes to his widow or other dependants is the product of the contributions made by his employer as well as by himself.</p>
                        <p>In the case of a non-contributory pension fund, of course, the full pension is to be attributed to the goodwill of the employer. However, the choice of joining a retirement annuity fund or not is entirely up to the individual. Furthermore, it is for him to decide upon the size of his annual contribution. If he makes use of the generous concessions provided for in this year&#x2019;s Income Tax Bill he will not only considerably reduce his current income tax burden but he will also be paying amounts into a fund which would otherwise have been paid into other investments which would eventually have been subject to estate duty.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, clause 4 of the Bill makes two further amendments to the Estate Duty Act. These amendments give effect to two of the concessions announced in my Budget speech on 28 March. In determining the net value of an estate for estate duty purposes various deductions may be made. Two of these are (a) so much of the proceeds of insurance policies on the life of the deceased and of the value of the benefits from pension, provident or retirement annuity funds passing as a result of the death of the deceased as does not exceed R35 000 and (b) so much of the value of certain public bonds and stock and of Land Bank debentures as does not exceed the difference between the sum of R70 000 and the amount deducted in respect of insurance and fund benefits. If therefore on the death of a deceased his estate collects R25 000 in respect of insurance policy proceeds and has R50 000 invested in Land Bank debentures, a total of R70 000 will be deductible in determining the net value of his estate.</p>
                        <p>The proposed amendments will increase the amounts deductible under these two headings from R35 000 to R40 000 and from R70 000 to R80 000, respectively.</p>
                        <p>From the net value of an estate, certain further deductions are made in order to arrive at the dutiable amount on which the tax is finally calculated. There are four such deductions, each of R30 000, the principal ones being the standard deduction, the deduction in respect of a surviving spouse and the deduction in respect of each surviving child of the deceased. The amendments to be introduced by clause 4 will increase each of these deductions to R35 000.</p>
                        <p>The combined effect of all these amendments to the Estate Duty Act will be of material value to many estates.</p>
                        <p>I turn now to the amendments to the Stamp Duties Act, 1968. The amendment made in terms of clause 6 to section 22 of the Act is of a purely textual nature and flows from the deletion of section 5(3) of the Act in 1977.</p>
                        <p>Clause 7 introduces an amendment to Item 11 of Schedule 1 of the Stamp Duties Act. Due to a customs tariff amendment the existing wording of the Item no longer describes the relevant documents correctly. In plain language the exemption covers the customs documents relating to the temporary importation of motor vehicles, yachts and other goods which are the 
                            <i>bona fide</i> property of tourists and which are to be re-exported within 12 months. The amendment extends the scope of the existing exemption very slightly but hon. Senators will be glad to learn that, at a total cost of a mere R200 per annum, a source of annoyance to tourists and an inconvenience to customs authorities at points of entry into South Africa, will be eliminated.
                        </p>
                        <p>The next clause, that is clause 8, amends Item 15 of the Stamp Duties Act. That Item governs the payment of duty on the registration of transfer of marketable securities, on the cancellation of certain shares and on the acquisition of marketable securities not involving the registration of transfer. As hon. Senators will be aware, the stamp duty payable under this item and the Marketable Securities Tax are complementary. Where marketable securities are bought on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Marketable Securities Tax is payable and there is an exemption from stamp duty on the registration of those securities. Where securities are purchased outside the Exchange then stamp duty is payable whether or not registration of transfer takes place. Since 1977 there has been complete neutrality between Marketable Securities Tax and stamp duty in the sense that the rate of both tax and duty has been the same, that is, one and a half per cent of the consideration payable in respect of the marketable securities. In view of the decision to reduce the rate of Marketable Securities Tax to one per cent it follows that in order to maintain neutrality between the two levies, the stamp duty likewise has had to be reduced to one per cent. The amendments which clause 8 introduces are designed to give effect to this reduction in the rate of the duty.</p>
                        <p>I come now, Mr. President, to the last clause in the Bill, that is clause 9, which returns to the matter of estate duty. The present Estate Duty Act of 1955 repealed the Death Duties Act of 1922, but only as regards the estates of persons who died or who die on or after 1 April 1955. The 1922 Act contained similar provisions, which means that both the 1922 and much earlier Acts going back well into the last century are still applicable in regard to the estates of, or successions arising by reason of the death of, persons who died prior to 1 April 1955. Now, as is well known, some persons seek to rule from the grave and the wills of a few persons who died many decades ago are still operative. In the result, a succession under one of these old estates occasionally comes to light and succession duty becomes payable. As is to be expected, cases of this nature will become fewer and further between with the passage of time and the stage has now been reached where the possible small amount of revenue from this source can no longer justify the administrative work involved in watching out for liability under these old laws and, when found, assessing and collecting the duty due. The provisions of this clause will terminate liability under these old laws in all cases where such liability had not been determined prior to the date of commencement of the Revenue Laws Amendment Act, 1979.</p>
                        <p>As indicated earlier, Mr. President, we shall continue to review these taxation laws at regular intervals and, if necessary, we shall introduce suitable amendments from time to time.</p>
                        <p>I commend this Bill to the Senate.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister dealt with a wide variety of matters in his Second Reading speech, some of which we support and welcome.</p>
                        <p>At the start of his Second Reading speech, the hon. the Minister mentioned that many of these present laws of which we make use today such as the Administration of Estates Act are very old Acts and that they were a very good source of revenue and that it would therefore be difficult for the Treasury to repeal them. In any event I want to say to the hon. the Minister that the fact that these Acts are so old does not in my opinion constitute sufficient reason for them to be retained. The hon. the Minister will agree with me that at the present stage we in South Africa are engaged in tax reform, as one might call it, to such an extent that I believe the hon. the Minister is attempting to encourage rather than counter capital formation. If we retain the Estate Duty Act which, in many cases, imposes such a heavy duty on an estate that much of it has to be disposed of to pay the tax, we shall certainly not be encouraging capital formation; indeed we shall be counteracting it.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister said that estate duty was no stranger in South Africa. In that regard I agree with him. It is no stranger. It is so old and so well-known that it has a beard. It is a source of great inconvenience in regard to many estates and one feels that one cannot really condone such a thing when one bears in mind that one has worked throughout one&#x2019;s life to accumulate something and when one&#x2019;s children come to inherit it, what one has toiled and worked hard for has to be given to the State.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister also referred to pensions or annuities which are continued with after a person&#x2019;s death. In my opinion all hon. Senators and members of Parliament are included in this category, because our pensions will continue, although in smaller amounts, if our spouses survive us.</p>

                        <p>This would then be included in the estate. I have taken note of the percentage tax. In such a case, says the hon. the Minister, the value of the annuity is calculated at 12% of the probable life of the annuitant. I believe that in many instances, tax can be levied that could be of such a nature, due to the inclusion of these pensions, that in fact it could reduce the average life of such a person instead of lengthening it. It could come as such a shock.</p>

                        <p>That and tax; unfortunately tax as well.</p>
                        <p>Moreover I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I think that the idea of reducing the tax on marketable securities is a very good idea. If it will help in any way to lend more life to our stock market in the non-gold shares section, then I shall really be very grateful to the hon. the Minister. This does not mean that I am a very big investor in that type of share, Sir, but it is nevertheless a fact that the Stock Exchange is the barometer of growth and confidence in our economy. Greater investments in the Stock Exchange can therefore be encouraged by way of this type of reduction in tax, particularly if one bears in mind that when one purchases large quantities of shares, a half per cent can make a very big difference, particularly if the prices are in accordance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, another matter on which I was not really able to obtain clarity from the hon. the Minister during the Second Reading was the question of a concession granted in regard to pensions and not retirement funds. The hon. the Minister advances as a reason for this that there is a clear distinction to be drawn between pension funds and annuity funds, and that is understandable. But I do not regard it as a convincing reason why the concession should be made in the one case and not in the other. I should therefore be obliged if the hon. the Minister could give us a further explanation of this.</p>
                        <p>With these few words, Mr. President, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that we support the Bill. For the most part it gives effect to the proposals he made in his budget speech. These have already been discussed on previous occasions and are now simply being moulded into laws in order eventually to be put into effect.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Swanepoel rightly said that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech covered a wide variety of matters embodied in the Bill at present before the House. As the hon. the Minister said, the matters embodied in the Bill are all important and indispensable sources of revenue&#x2014;indeed, traditional sources of revenue. In fact this only gives effect to tax proposals that have already been put before the House. Having listened to the explanation by the hon. the Minister, we were content, but now that I have listened to the hon. Senator Swanepoel, I am again inclined to agree with him. When one takes both standpoints into account one must in my opinion decide what is popular and what is responsible. It goes without saying, therefore, that the hon. the Minister adopted a responsible attitude.</p>
                        <p>I should like to put the following idea to the hon. the Minister. Whereas certain concessions are being made, particularly with regard to estate duty&#x2014;and they are important concessions&#x2014;are these concessions that are made from year to year keeping pace with the constant reduction in the value of money? In my opinion that is the crux of the problem.</p>

                        <p>Judging from that interjection I infer that that is a remark which enjoys widespread sympathy. However, I think that this is something which ought to be taken into account throughout the system of taxation. In some cases it seems as if there is no adjustment of the rate of taxation in the tax system because due to the fact that the value of money is dwindling, tax is increasing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House realize that much good will come of this Bill. It embodies important concessions, other important matters are rationalized and we therefore support the Bill.</p>

Do the pensions which we as retired Senators will begin to draw when we retire fall within the ambit of this amendment?

                        <p>Well, Mr. President, I am very grateful, and I will now not challenge those hon. Senators any longer. But I am not sure whether they understood the matter correctly either because one of them said &#x201C;wet van Transvaal&#x201D;, which meant that he anticipated that his pension in his widow&#x2019;s hands would be taxed. So they did not really know what the position was and neither did I. But the hon. the Minister now says that our pensions are excluded. I declare a personal interest on behalf of my widow one day and so I shall not take the matter any further.</p>
                        <p>But there is a very interesting constitutional matter that arises out of the shape in which this Bill has come to us. This is, as the hon. the Minister will accept, an omnibus Bill which amends various existing pieces of legislation such as the Marketable, Securities Tax Act, the Transfer Duty Act, the Estate Duty Act and the Stamp Duties Act. There are four that I can see that this Bill as an omnibus Bill amends. Now, section 60(3) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act reads&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">The Senate may not amend any Bills so far as they impose taxation or charges, or appropriate revenue or moneys for the services of the Government.</block>
                        <p>Strictly legally interpreted that means that if this Senate does not like one clause in this Bill but it likes all the others, it cannot move for the amendment or deletion of that clause because that would be amending the whole Bill. The only remedy would then be to vote against the whole Bill. This arises out of the omnibus nature of Bills of this sort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, this House will know what my views are about omnibus Bills. I have always said that I do not like them. I have always said that we must have separate Bills amending original Acts. Now this omnibus Bill&#x2014;and I am quite serious about this&#x2014; brings us into a position where we are bound by the provisions of section 60 of the Constitution of South Africa.</p>

                        <p>This Bill imposes taxation or charges, but in fact it is not one Bill. There are four Bills here; there might be more, but four that I can see immediately. So, Sir, we have a constitutional contretemps here, a constitutional problem, a Harry Schwarz, in fact. That is how we in the NRP refer to our ex-colleague; we call a problem a Harry Schwarz. Well, here we are; we have a Harry Schwarz here; we have a problem. It is an interesting and very difficult constitutional problem. I might wish to vote against a particular subsection&#x2014; (a)
                            <i>bis</i> dealing with estate duties&#x2014;because I do not like it, but I cannot do that because I would be amending this Bill. I will, therefore, have to vote against the whole Bill if I do not like that subsection. To me as a one-time lawyer it raises an interesting point. I see the hon. the Minister has something in his hand so I will sit down now and ask him to reply to the debate. We can perhaps take this further a little later.

                        <p>The saving grace here is, and I think this is why it is put in an omnibus form, that all these provisions reduce taxes. They do not impose taxes. So I think we live again, on this one.</p>

                        <p>I am glad the hon. Senator raised the point, because it is a very interesting constitutional one. It is something one would like to think about further.

                        <p>*I want to thank all hon. Senators most sincerely for their support of this measure. I should also like to refer to the question of estate duty. Estate duty still exists in South Africa today, but in recent years considerable relief has been granted in this regard. In this connection I want to use the example of a widow with two children. If the total net value of her late husband&#x2019;s estate, including the proceeds from insurance policies or Government stock to the value of R25 000, amounts to R140 000, no estate duty will be payable in these circumstances. In 1948, the first figure I have, estate duty of R33 000 or 23% would have been payable. In 1964, estate duty of R14 000 or 10% would have been payable on an estate of R140 000. In 1948, an estate of R200 000 would have been subject to an estate duty of almost R65 000, which amounts to almost one-third of the estate. In 1964, it would have been R29 000, or less than 15%, whereas today it is R5 000 or 2&#x00BD;%. Therefore this is a considerable decrease. On an estate of R300 000&#x2014;this will probably be our good farming friends and not us&#x2014;the duty in 1948 was R107 000, almost 36%, in 1964 it was R54 000, or 18%, whereas today it is R27 000 or 9%. I must concede that to an extent estate duty is an inconvenient tax, but if one bears in mind that the State receives between R40 million and R60 million, depending on the state of the economy, from this source every year, this is not something that can be summarily abolished, particularly if one considers notes that the demands being made on the Exchequer today for Defence and security purposes are very high. However, I have furnished these comparisons to indicate that we have already granted considerable relief in this regard.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Swanepoel referred to the distinction we draw between a pension and a retirement annuity and the matter of capitalizing the income received under those two headings for the purpose of estate duty. We are now going to eliminate the capitalized value of pensions from a recognized pension fund, whereas we are not going to do that in the case of retirement annuity fund benefits. It is simply a case of the view one takes of these two. As we see it, and always have seen it, there is a fairly substantial difference as regards the nature of these two funds. I do not wish to repeat all of them but just let me run through a few of them quickly.</p>
                        <p>Membership of a pension fund is compulsory, which means that an employee has no discretion in the matter. The employer recovers the employee&#x2019;s contributions from the latter&#x2019;s pay, he adds his own contribution and pays the combined amount over to the fund. In the fullness of time an annuity becomes payable to the member or to his dependants. The self-employed person does have a discretion. He may decide to enjoy his money now or he may decide to join a retirement annuity fund. If he does so decide he can shop around and join the fund which best suits his purpose.</p>
                        <p>Employers as well as employees contribute to pension funds. Sometimes an employer contributes very generously and he may even bear all the contributions in some cases. The pension which eventually becomes payable to the retired employee or to his dependants is therefore not solely the product of the employee&#x2019;s own thrift. Had he been able to bank the equivalent of his own contributions instead of paying them into the pension fund his estate would not have been swelled to the extent of the capitalized value of the pension payable to his widow. The annuity payable by a retirement annuity fund is, however, the product of the taxpayer&#x2019;s own savings. Had he, instead of joining the retirement annuity fund, deposited each month an amount equal to his contribution to the fund he would have had in the bank, together with accrued interest, at least as much as the capitalized value of the annuity payable to his widow on his death.</p>
                        <p>Most retirement annuity funds are underwritten by insurance companies and the amount which becomes available for the purchase of an annuity is, as indicated, the product of the member&#x2019;s contributions only. By way of contrast, some established pension funds are very wealthy and are able to pay annuities in excess of those normally based solely on the employer&#x2019;s and employee&#x2019;s own contributions. They sometimes build up very big reserve funds on which they receive considerable interest income.</p>
                        <p>Where a member of a retirement annuity fund retires and receives a pension, and then after a period of time dies, the annuity which his widow receives is normally a continuation of his own annuity. In other words, the widow steps into her husband&#x2019;s shoes. Clearly there is a valuable asset passing as a result of the husband&#x2019;s death. The position with pension funds is usually different for the widow normally becomes entitled to an annuity in her own right in terms of the rules of the fund. She is not, therefore, the successor to her late husband&#x2019;s pension. That pension would normally die with him.</p>
                        <p>Having said all this, I know that it is perhaps not quite as convincing as it sounds. However, there are people who feel that the taxing authority ought not to draw quite a sharp distinction between the two. As I said in the Other Place, I am quite prepared to ask the Registrar of Insurance to take this matter up with the Life Offices Association and with the Advisory Committee on Long Term Insurance to see what the general view might be in the industry at this moment. Perhaps we can have a very close and critical discussion about the matter and we can see how the matter stands next year. But I do hope that hon. Senators will feel that the concession we have made in regard to the pensions, and the fact that the capitalized value will fall away from the estate&#x2019;s value, is not too bad for the next few months.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I rise merely to point out to the hon. the Minister that in spite of the fact that we have been afforded relief in regard to estate duty over the years, it has still been the case every year that in spite of the relief, his estimated revenue from estate duty has been higher than the previous year. In those instances and in those years it was in my opinion the case that the relief afforded by the hon. the Minister did not keep pace with the reduction in the value of money. This year is the first year in which there will be an estimated reduction of R&#x00BD; million on the revenue of the previous year.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Listen to the amount which the hon. the Minister is nevertheless going to obtain by way of estate duty. The amount is R44&#x00BD; million, and the number of estates on which this duty is levied is not large. It would be interesting to know what the average duty per estate would be if one were to divide tins among the estates that are taxed, and what was the maximum and the minimum duty levied. I do not want this now, Sir; they are merely statistics that I mention for interest&#x2019;s sake.</p>
                        <p>Sir, it seems to me that the levying of duty is often done on a basis which the hon. Senator Horak is so fond of referring to as &#x201C;boereverneukery&#x201D;. When one takes the case of stamp duties, one sees that despite the relief we are being afforded, the Treasury will gain R19&#x00BD; million more this year than it did last year by way of stamp duty. In the case of transfer duty the figure is R10 million more than last year. Therefore, while we welcome the relief being afforded, I do think that it is only right that we should also point out to the hon. the Minister that this is a case of &#x201C;What you lose on the swings, you gain on the roundabouts&#x201D;.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I just want to make a few remarks in regard to the implementation of the Bill before the House. I do not think we ought to let the occasion pass without expressing our thanks and appreciation for the concessions set out in clause 4. I do not believe that at first glance the hon. Senators realize the extent of these concessions. In his reply to the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister mentioned comparative figures. We must note that in the case of a married couple, the abatement is basically being reduced twice by R5 000; in the case of children it is R5 000 for every child, and R5 000 on insurance policies etc., and what this amounts to is that in the case of a family with three children, an additional total concession of R30 000 is being granted. When we compare these figures with the first schedule of the Estate Duty Act and take an estate of R100 000 plus, we see that the savings amount to 25% above R100 000 on that increased amount. This means an amount of R7 500. If we take an estate of R300 000 plus, as would apply in the case of many of the hon. Senators opposite, if not all, we find that the saving is 35%. In this case the abatement is R30 000 and it means that estate duty is reduced by an amount of R10 500.</p>
                        <p>I rose merely to draw attention to this. We are so quick to complain about the tax position but I really think that at first glance we do not realize the extent of the concessions set out in clause 4.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I, too, am grateful for the concessions being made here, but I just want to react to what the hon. the Minister said a moment ago. He referred to rich farmers with estates of R300 000, and I want to say to the hon. the Minister that a decent farming enterprise is easily worth R300 000 today, but there are no cash savings with which to pay estate duty. The effect of this may be that an economic farming unit is destroyed thereby because the persons who have to inherit it have to get rid of essential sections of the farming enterprise and thus eventually make it an uneconomic proposition. I should be obliged if the hon. the Minister could give attention to this in the future and try to bring the arguments we use in this regard more into line with the truth.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I shall be very brief. In the first place I want to thank the hon. Senator Van Rensburg for the interesting figures he furnished to the House. I said certain things in a lighter vein but I accept that there are problems. I must say that I personally know of cases where the estate has been fairly large but where cash has not always been easily available. This is true, but it is largely for that reason that provision has been made for the amount that may be invested in assurance policies and Government stocks.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel referred to the fact that although relief had been effected with regard to estate duty, the earnings had not really dropped. I think this may be so, but that is not solely ascribable to depreciation in the value of money, but also to the population increase&#x2014;I think that is a factor&#x2014;and the increase in the number of estates reported. I think our statistics in this regard have been streamlined and made a little more effective than before.</p>
                        <p>As far as stamp and transfer duties are concerned, I must inform hon. Senators that the increases in the amounts levied are to some extent ascribable to an improvement in the property market and the Stock Exchange. I say that they are partly ascribable to this. Talking of the Stock Exchange, I recall what happened when I came here at the beginning of 1970. The hon. Senator Swanepoel was speakingzwhen I was listening to a financial debate for the first time. He was really hauling my predecessor over the coals concerning certain statements he had supposedly made in regard to the rise in Stock Exchange up to May 1969. He will recall it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>As I stated in my Budget speech on 28 March, we in South Africa are engaged in an important programme of tax reform the object of which is gradually to move away from the present system where the principal emphasis is placed on direct taxes to one where both direct and indirect taxes play a more balanced role. The first and historical step along that long and difficult road was taken last year when sales tax was introduced, and I am pleased to be able to say that as a result of thorough planning the proceeds from that source have already provided us with sufficient freedom of movement to be able to make the considerable income and other tax concessions which I announced on 28 March.</p>
                        <p>To those who, like Oliver Twist, expected more, I should like to mention that as in the case of politics, tax concessions are the art of the possible. Given a maximum tax revenue which we could afford to surrender, my department tried out no fewer than 13 possible combinations of tax rates, income abatements etc. before the right combination for the occasion was found. I am fully aware that, in view of the decline in the value of money, the level at which the maximum rate of taxation is reached&#x2014;55% on an income of R30 000 in the case of a married person&#x2014;is still not the level which we should like to see and, as soon as circumstances permit, further attention will be given to this matter. As I have said, however, the road ahead is not an easy one, and at this stage it is impossible, and in fact undesirable, to make any firm predictions. However, we are now moving in the right direction and it is expected that it will be possible to maintain the momentum. Hon. Senators are already in possession of a comprehensive explanatory memorandum on the Bill, yet I still think that a few words by way of explanation of the background to certain of the amendments as well as of matters which are receiving our attention or which are of general interest would not be inappropriate.</p>
                        <p>I shall consequently begin with the rates of tax for the coming year of assessment and in this connection I should like to draw the attention of hon. Senators to clauses 1, 2 and 5, as well as to the schedule to the Bill. As may be deduced from my previous remarks, the new scales should not be seen exclusively as a fiscal measure but also as a further step in our programme of reform. That the concessions in many cases are considerable will be realized next month by thousands of salary earners when the new deduction tables come into operation. Provisional taxpayers will share the same experience during August and, when the final assessments are issued after the close of the 1979-&#x2019;80 tax year and a final adjustment is made, this will come as a further bonus. I hope this will serve as an incentive and that returns will be submitted earlier and more expeditiously next year.</p>
                        <p>Clause 3 inserts amendments to certain definitions in section 1 of the principal Act. Some of these amendments will be discussed later when I come to clause 8 and in the meantime I shall confine myself to the question of the amalgamation of co-operative societies.</p>
                        <p>Section 94 of the Co-operative Societies Act lays down the rules that have to be followed when two or more co-operatives amalgamate. Actually the procedure is very simple. What actually happens is that the amalgamating co-operatives disappear and from them a new co-operative will arise which in reality is merely a continuation of the original co-operatives. However, the repercussions for the purposes of income tax are considerable, for any assessed loss which the amalgamating co-operatives may have had, will die with them. Moreover, if some of the debts which the new co-operative took over from the old ones subsequently appear to be irrecoverable, the amounts thus written off by the new co-operative may not be claimed as a deduction in determining taxable income. There are other repercussions as well which need not be spelt out here.</p>
                        <p>At present my department is reviewing the entire situation and will, it is hoped, be able to make suggestions in this connection within a few months. The amendment which is being inserted by clause 3(1)(e) is merely an interim measure intended to make the deduction of a bonus by the amalgamated co-operatives possible.</p>
                        <p>I may add here that it is in no way the intention to amend the position of ordinary companies which may amalgamate in terms of the Companies Act. Such amalgamations are not comparable with those which occur under section 94 of the Co-operative Societies Act and they shall continue to be subject to the present rules in the Income Tax Act.</p>
                        <p>Clause 6 gives effect to the proposal in my Budget speech that a special tax rebate would be introduced for inhabitants of Walvis Bay. However, I must mention here that the reduced rates of tax, which will be applicable with effect from the 1980 year of assessment, will to a certain extent reduce the difference between the South African and the South West African taxes and will in some cases even eliminate it entirely.</p>
                        <p>The amendments to section 10 of the principal Act which are being inserted by clause 7 are primarily of a textual nature. The most important is perhaps the exemption in respect of the receipts and accruals of the South African Special Risk Insurance Association. This association was formed in order to provide insurance in respect of damage which may be suffered as a result of sedition.</p>
                        <p>†I come now, Mr. President, to the amendments which are to be made by clause 8 to various portions of section 11 of the principal Act. That section provides for the general deductions which may be taken into account in the determination of taxable income. Together with the reduction in the rates of tax, the increases in the abatements and the amendments to be made in terms of clause 13, these are perhaps the most important in the Bill, certainly as far as self-employed persons are concerned.</p>
                        <p>We have never sought to limit the amount which a taxpayer may contribute annually to a pension fund or a retirement annuity fund, but what the principal Act has done is to limit the contributions which may be deducted for income tax purposes. At one time the limits were fairly low, but they have been raised at regular intervals, especially during the past few years, and now stand at R1 750 in the case of a pension fund and R3 500 in the case of a retirement annuity fund. The R3 500 limit also applies where the taxpayer is a member of both types of funds. Where a taxpayer is earning, say, R10 000 a year, a maximum permissible deduction of R1 750 in respect of contributions to a pension fund is by no means ungenerous, but where he is fortunate enough to be earning, say, R40 000 a year an annual contribution of that order could seldom hope to secure him a pension which would be in keeping with his earnings. A somewhat similar situation applies in the case of a retirement annuity fund.</p>
                        <p>What we propose to do, therefore, is to allow a taxpayer to deduct by way of pension contributions an amount of up to 7,5% of his remuneration from retirement-funding employment. Where a taxpayer contributes to a retirement annuity fund he will in future be allowed to deduct up to 15% of his income from trade, after excluding his income from retirement-funding employment. The salaried man to whom I referred a moment ago who earns R40 000 a year, will thus be able to contribute R3 000 annually to a pension fund and have that amount deducted in the determination of his taxable income, while the professional man whose practice yields him a profit of R40 000 will be able to contribute R6 000 to a retirement annuity fund and have that amount deducted for income tax purposes. At this point I must emphasize that, while making these concessions, we are entrenching the existing deductions in the law, which means that someone whose income from trade is less than R23 334 will still be able to claim up to R1 750 in respect of pension fund contributions or R3 500 in respect of retirement annuity fund contributions. Where he is a member of both types of funds, the R3 500 limit also applies. In essense, then, these concessions will enable those persons with an annual income from trade in excess of R23 334 to lay-by more generously against the day that none of us mortals can hope to escape.</p>
                        <p>Hon. Senators may well raise the question: Why the difference between the amounts deductible in respect of pension contributions and those in respect of retirement annuity fund contributions? In this regard I may be traversing some of the same ground as earlier but I should like to put this briefly. The answer to this question is that, although the end result is the same in the sense that an annuity will one day be paid to the member, the two types of funds differ from one another in a basic area. What will one day emerge from a retirement annuity fund will be entirely the product of the member&#x2019;s own sacrifices during his working life, whereas in the case of a pension fund the annuity payable on retirement is usually the product of the employer&#x2019;s contributions as well as those of the members. In many cases the employer&#x2019;s contributions are very generous, far exceeding those of the employees. In these circumstances we think we are justified in maintaining this distinction which has applied ever since retirement annuity funds were first recognized for income tax purposes.</p>
                        <p>I may add here that the amendments made in terms of clauses 17 and 18 to the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act are directly linked with the amendment being made in terms of clause 8 to section 11 of the Act.</p>
                        <p>I shall deal next with the amendments introduced by clauses 10 and 11. The Income Tax Act contains provisions which are designed to encourage the building up and maintenance of a South African merchant fleet consisting of first-class vessels. In a nutshell, the shipowner is permitted to write off 40% of the cost of a ship in the year of purchase and the balance of 60% in six equal annual instalments of 10% each. Details of the types of vessels which qualify for these allowances are given in the White Paper or explanatory memorandum. It has been pointed out recently that whereas a coasting vessel of as little as 200 gross register tons so qualifies, a fishing trawler does not unless its tonnage exceeds one thousand. This may have been a reasonable distinction to make twenty years ago, but times have changed. Trawlers have tended to become smaller, but because of modern equipment and the installation of powerful machinery they are much more efficient than their much larger sisters used to be. Because of these developments, and not only because of inflation, the cost of building a modern trawler has risen astronomically. I consider that there is ample justification for reducing the qualifying tonnage of a fishing vessel from one thousand to two hundred gross register tons.</p>
                        <p>The amendment made in terms of clause 10 to section 12 of the principal Act merely ensures that, where a factory trawler qualifies for the special shipping allowance under section 14 of the Act, the machinery initial allowance granted in terms of section 12 of the Act will not be allowed in respect of that portion of the cost of the trawler as relates to the processing machinery or plant built into the trawler.</p>
                        <p>Clause 13 amends section 24B of the principal Act. That section was introduced last year and deals with gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions. In drafting the amendments we have had regard to the helpful advice given to us by professional associations and to the commentaries which have appeared in certain taxation and other publications. While it would be too much to hope that we have satisfied every critic, we have, I think, gone a long way in that direction. Further attention will be given to the section when circumstances permit and, if necessary, further amendments will be proposed in due course.</p>
                        <p>Hon. Senators will be aware that, as the law now reads, section 24B does not apply if a forward exchange contract was available to the taxpayer and he failed to make use of the facility. When the section was introduced last year, such contracts were available only in respect of a limited range of transactions, and the inclusion of this condition was intended as a sort of carrot and stick to encourage businessmen to take out forward cover where it was in fact available. Since that time the De Kock Commission has reported and one of the results of its labours is that forward exchange contracts are now available in a wide variety of circumstances. Since it was never intended that section 24B should be virtually a dead letter&#x2014;in fact our intentions were exactly the opposite&#x2014;we have reviewed the position and decided to remove this particular condition with retrospective effect.</p>
                        <p>Section 64C of the principal Act provides for exemptions from the non-resident&#x2019;s tax on interest and hon. Senators will have noticed that, in terms of the third amendment introduced by clause 14, I am taking power, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister of Community Development to exempt from the tax interest on foreign loans raised for housing or community development schemes in the Republic. The provision of suitable housing to meet the needs of our growing population is a matter of the greatest moment and I think it will be agreed that the sacrifice of a limited amount of revenue in order to reduce the cost of that housing to some extent and at the same time to attract funds from abroad for this purpose, is a small price to pay.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, the nature of the amendments to be made by clause 15 to section 83 of the principal Act is apparent from what is said in the explanatory memorandum. I think, however, that a few additional words of explanation are called for. As far as is possible, judgments or decisions of the Income Tax Special Courts are published for general information. In terms of the regulations framed under the Income Tax Act, however, publication of any such judgment or decision is subject to the consent of the appellant. Now it sometimes happens that an appellant, for reasons known to himself, declines to allow a judgment to be published, even though his identity is concealed. This is indeed a pity, and it is felt that valuable decisions should no longer be capable of being withheld from the public at the whim of the taxpayer. The proposed amendments will enable the President of the Court who is a judge of the Supreme Court, to overrule the appellant in certain circumstances. The anonymity of the appellant will be fully preserved, just as has been the case in the past.</p>
                        <p>The amendment introduced by clause 16 to the First Schedule to the principal Act follows from an announcement made in my Budget Speech that farmers who have elected the system of equalized tax rates (&#x201C;nivellering&#x201D; in Afrikaans) will henceforth be taxed at the lower of the equalized rate or their rate of tax for the year in accordance with the normal rules. This represents an extremely generous concession to farmers and should be of particular benefit to those who have suffered as a result of the recent drought.</p>
                        <p>Under the pay-as-you-earn system of tax collection the threshold at which provisional tax becomes payable has for many years stood at R500. The amendment effected by clause 19 will raise that threshold to R1 000 and enable the Secretary for Inland Revenue to remove the names of some 210 000 persons from the register of provisional taxpayers. Not only will this result in a measurable saving in costs, but it will also save a large number of elderly persons the trouble of estimating their income twice every year and every six months making a journey to the local revenue office in order to pay their provisional tax. This does not, however, mean a sacrifice of revenue but rather a deferment as the tax will be collected when an assessment is issued.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry, Mr. President, that what I intended to be relatively brief remarks on this Bill have tended to become somewhat extended. There are, however, one or two further matters which I wish to touch on briefly before I close.</p>
                        <p>In my budget speech I referred to the matter of fringe benefits and stated that a report on the subject was expected soon. That report has since been submitted to me and arrangements are being made for it to be published in the 
                            <i>Government Gazette</i> during the latter part of July so that the public will have a full opportunity to study the proposals and submit their comments. It is disturbing to note that, in spite of my budget statement, reports have appeared in various newspapers and periodicals which suggest that a massive witch-hunt is about to be set afoot and insinuate that civil servants receive valuable tax-free prerequisites which will continue to go untaxed. Those reports, Mr. President, contain some truths, some half-truths and some untruths which are twisted in such a way as to create the impression that civil servants and members of the Senate are an elite class who are growing fat at the expense of the general public. If the writers of these misleading and damaging articles would take the trouble to examine the facts and compare them fairly with what is enjoyed by persons in the private sector, they would be forced to change their tune. In any event, it will soon be seen that the report on the taxation of fringe benefits goes out of its way to ensure equality of treatment between the public and private sectors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, in regard to the matter of a capital gains tax, the situation seems to have been reached where the introduction of such a tax is regarded in certain quarters as inevitable. Such, Mr. President, is certainly not the case. A draft Bill will be published for general information during the recess, and in the light of the comments received from all quarters a decision one way or the other will be taken. In the meantime the Government is in no way committed to the introduction of such a tax.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I commend the Bill to the Senate.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, the latter part of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech is very interesting in view of his budget proposals in regard to a fringe benefit and capital gains tax. I cannot comment on this as we have not seen the draft Bill or know very little about its contents or what is proposed, but I would again appeal to the hon. the Minister to be very lenient in the drawing up of the provisions of this draft Bill. I believe that under our present economic conditions, with a tax on capital gains and also on fringe benefits we might find ourselves in a position where it could possibly mean retarding the rate of growth that we are so anxious to achieve.</p>
                        <p>There are considerable concessions in the Bill before us. There is a concession to the shipping industry, for instance. I can see the purpose of these concessions and on behalf of the recipients I want to express my appreciation. But I must admit that I know very little about shipping and that is therefore the most I can do.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister must not think that in my part of the world we do not have sea or waves. In the Kalahari we have a sea of sand, and the dunes are our waves, but unfortunately we use camels for ships and not the type of craft that is used on the ocean.</p>
                        <p>*Mr. President, the relief in respect of the income tax margins is something which this side of the House has been requesting for a long time, but what was particularly encouraging in the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister was that the lowering of the margins is not merely a fiscal measure but is in fact part of a new tax reform system which we are introducing in the Republic. Consequently I think it gives a reasonable degree of permanence to lower tax scales in our tax structure and also holds out the prospect of further reductions in tax rates, as circumstances allow.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister also expressed the hope that tax forms would in future be returned sooner as a result of these concessions. I readily concede that in the case of salary earners and pensioners it is probably not very difficult to fill in a tax form and send it back. But the preparation, auditing and drawing up of balance sheets is not such an easy task. At that time of the year there is nothing one can do to get one&#x2019;s accountants to work faster since they usually have so much work that they cannot give preference to a particularsk. Consequently I am afraid that the hon. the Minister and his department will have to go on being patient with these people. I do not think there is anyone who deliberately wants to delay the handing inof an income tax form, but even to the ordinary farmers these forms have become so complicated that they have to rely on people with more knowledge in this respect, who will hand in the forms in their own good time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I now wish to express a few ideas on pension funds. In my view the hon. the Minister would not harm the economy in any way if he were to add a further R500 to the existing figure of R3 500 as far as retirement annuity funds are concerned. The amount of R23 000 which the hon. the Minister mentioned here, and the accompanying deduction of R3 500 for retirement funds sounds reasonable, but I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that many persons use this kind of fund as a way of saving and also as a hedge against penury in their old age. If one is able to make this minor concession of an additional R500 per annum I think these funds are also a means of saving and a source from which the State, as in the past, could obtain loans in times when capital is not very readily available. In my opinion saving should be encouraged in every country in the world and in every sphere. I would therefore be grateful if the hon. the Minister would take this suggestion into consideration in his next budget.</p>
                        <p>I now wish to refer to the reports of the special courts. I believe that these reports of the special courts, or rather the judgments given by the special income tax court, should as far as possible be made known to interested persons and to persons involved in the drawing up and completion of income tax forms. In spite of the concessions which the hon. the Minister wishes to effect by way of an amendment in this Bill I do not think that these concessions go far enough. We on this side of the House believe that there will be many people who will not see much sense in granting their permission for the publication of the evidence and the findings in such cases. It is merely a natural and human characteristic, for why should they grant their permission if the case is over and judgment has been given? There is no encouraging reason for them to grant their permission for the publication of these judgments. I wish to suggest&#x2014;the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper gives effect to this&#x2014;that one should try instead to apply the provision in a different way, i.e. by allowing 30 days in which an appellant may object to the publishing of the findings and the judgment. If he has not objected within a period of 30 days then they may be published.</p>
                        <p>With these few words we on this side of the House support the Bill. I wish to express the hope that the tax reforms envisaged by the hon. the Minister will have reached such an advanced stage next year that he will be able to announce further reductions in the tax rates to us.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I wish to thank the Opposition for supporting this Bill. The hon. Senator Swanepoel was quite right in pointing out that this Bill forms part of the tax reform programme. The hon. the Minister said the same thing, and I think it is right that we should consider it in that light.</p>
                        <p>†When the general sales tax was introduced about a year ago a fair amount of apprehension existed, in particular on the part of the opposition, about its success, the wisdom of it, about the scope of it and about its effects. I think it is the view of all of us&#x2014; there is no sense in the Government trying to score a debating point at this particular stage and I do not think we are trying to do so&#x2014; that the introduction of the general sales tax, its effects and the benefits we are in fact perceiving this afternoon, are a credit and a monument to the hon. the Minister of Finance. I think few people realize the number of administrative difficulties that accompanied the introduction of this massive programme, a programme which not only involved a new concept but which also required a great deal of administrative know-how and dedication on the part of the staff.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Seeing that we are dealing with the Income Tax Bill and that general sales tax forms a part of taxation, I think it is quite appropriate that I should refer to it. I also think the explanatory memorandum accompanying this Bill is a very comprehensive one and is one which we on this side of the House have welcomed very much.</p>
                        <p>Something which has not yet been mentioned, but which I would like to refer to, is the question of the classification of somebody who is in fact making a contribution as supporting a dependant. We are now raising the amount required to qualify as a deduction from income from R1 200 to R2 400 per year. In the light of the diminishing value of money I think this is to be welcomed. On the other hand, abatement allowances have been increased. This is a compensatory factor because we are now reducing the diminution abatement rate to about half of what it was previously. In the past the abatement rates diminished by R2 per R1 000 (for a certain income and more) whereas it will now be R1 per R1 000. The new Treasury bonds with an interest rate of 7% still give us a tax-free investment up to an amount of R40 000. Something which might interest the hon. Senator Koch is that the deductible amount from a wife&#x2019;s earnings has been increased from R750 to R900 per annum.</p>
                        <p>With the change of accent as regards the levying of taxes, I think we can look forward to many reforms in the future. It may be that what the hon. Senator Swanepoel has just asked for may become a reality in a year or two&#x2019;s time. The hon. the Minister is continually looking for ways and means of ensuring that we are not going to act punitively towards the producer. I think the hon. the Minister has achieved this aim with these tax proposals. We on this side of the House wish to congratulate him on this and we support the Bill wholeheartedly.</p>

                    <speech by="#rensburg">
                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, there is something which is not quite clear to me and if the hon. the Minister is unable to help me now, it is something which I could eventually clear up with the department. Section ll(l)(iv), which is being inserted by clause 8, provides that as far as a partnership is concerned, its members will be deemed to be one person for the purposes of the paragraph. This provision is not clear to me, and I would be pleased if the hon. the Minister could possibly throw more light on it.</p>
                        <p>I should also like to say a few words about clause 15. The legal profession really welcomes this provision. Some of our most important legal judgments are on the question of income tax. I, myself, have dealt with cases where the income tax court gave a decision on a certain legal point which the appeal court subsequently amended. At present Butterworth is one of the largest publishers of legal decisions. I wonder whether an arrangement cannot be made with them to publish legal principles&#x2014;not all the facts, nor any identification of the persons involved&#x2014;separately. It would serve as a good reference work for everyone.</p>
                        <p>I should also like to say something about capital gains tax. This question is not under discussion now, but the hon. the Minister referred to it. I trust that the question of inflation will be borne in mind in the consideration of this matter. The hon. Senator Oelrich, in a previous debate, pointed out quite correctly that a rand which had been worth a 100c 10 years ago, was worth 15c today. When we calculate our profits on sales today, taking into consideration the interest rates which we have paid over the years, we realize that what may appear to be a profit today could very well be a loss.</p>
                        <p>We know of the case, approximately three decades ago, when the late Minister Hofmeyr introduced gains tax on immovable property. It created so much work and so many problems that after three or four years the tax was eventually dropped. When it was calculated on a single asset only, such as immovable property, it was found that it was impractical. I am mentioning this in all humility, Mr. President, for once the Bill is here, it may create more problems than if we were to express a few reservations about it before the time. Consequently I just want to emphasize the question of the tremendous inflation, and point out that what may initially appear to be a profit may in reality be a loss if we take everything into consideration which we have spent in that connection in the course of time.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I think I must make some contribution to this debate in regard to what the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter has said. I wish to thank the hon. the Minister for increasing the allowance for married women, but I must tell him that women are beginning to feel rather like that old song: &#x201C;How ya gonna keep &#x2019;em down on the farm, after they&#x2019;ve seen Paree.&#x201D; Unfortunately, we all see and we all read what is going on in the rest of the world, and we rather feel that we are getting a raw deal. We appreciate everything about the men in this country, except one thing, and that is that when it comes to money they like to keep us short of it. Girls feel a kiss on the hand may be all very well but a diamond bracelet lasts for ever. I should like to give Senator Horwood a kiss on the hand for increasing the allowance, but we just feel we should get what everybody else is getting. At the risk of being a bore I want to read what has been written in this connection&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>No, not Adele van der Spuy; I am not going into competition with her! We know that the hon. Senator Van Schoor has a very soft spot for her, so maybe he will also understand how women can sometimes be driven mad with frustration. [Interjections.] I know that his idea is to get a woman in the Transvaal into Parliament and we all know which woman he has in mind. But if you do not give the women some incentive to come back to work they will stay at home even Adele. We do not want a repetition of what happened with petrol but we are going to make a heck of a demand when you need us. We therefore ask the hon. the Minister of Finance to reconsider our case and to remember too that we are going to be there, but that we cannot be there successfully unless you make it possible for us to be there now.</p>
                        <p>For a long time I have also wanted to put in a word for pensions for our husbands, but as the hon. Senator Horak does that on every possible occasion, and because he is a great defender of the poor and of women and orphans, I think I can leave that matter safely to him and to Mrs. Suzman in the Other Place. Meanwhile I am speaking in clichés this afternoon, and in platitudes, and perhaps I do sound a bit like a Cassandra because I bring this future woman shortage up on every occasion. However, I am even becoming frightened of one thing, something the hon. Senator Carr once said to me while I was aggressively crossing a street&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I should like to thank hon. Senators on both sides of the House for their support of this measure which I think everyone will agree is a very important one. In the first place, I wish to reply to a matter raised by the hon. Senator Swanepoel. He suggested that we should perhaps increase the amount in the case of annuity funds from R3 500 to R4 000; this is of course a further concession, but I shall give thorough consideration to it. I shall discuss the matter with my senior officials and we could perhaps look into the matter early next year.

                        <p>We shall come back to this point, and I shall give it thorough attention. I agree with the hon. Senator Swanepoel that this is a very important form of saving. There is no doubt about that, it is becoming increasingly important in our economy, and we must bear it in mind.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel also referred to clause 15 in connection with the publication of decisions of the special court. I want to thank him for the amendments which he moved, and for his interest in this matter. I think his amendments are aimed at reducing the administrative work in connection with the publication of court decisions, but there are certain practical problems. He must not think now that we are ostensibly refusing any amendment; that is not so, but I want to try to elucidate the situation as we see it a little further. There are one or two problems in connection with these amendments. In the first place, in terms of regulation B.15 which is being deleted by subsection (2), decisions are only published with the express consent of the appellant and I hesitate to depart from this principle, except in cases where the appellant withholds his consent unreasonably. Secondly, according to the wording as moved by the hon. Senator, the Registrar will accept, if the appellant does not react to his notice, that there is no objection and proceed to have the decision published. However, that may not be the case either. The appellant may not have received the notice. Of course, this situation could also arise in terms of the wording which I have proposed, but in the latter case the anonymity of the appellant will be preserved in that publication will only take place on the authorization of the president of the court, and not automatically, as would be the case in terms of the amendment moved by the hon. Senator, as I understand it.</p>

                        <p>†Then, Mr. President, the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter seems to have been under the impression that the abatement for a dependant has been increased from R1 200 to R2 400.

                        <p>*The hon. Senator Van Rensburg raised one or two interesting points. He asked why a partnership is regarded as one person. The amendment relates to the contributions which an employer makes to pension funds. The maximum contribution which is normally allowed, and this may of course be increased, is an amount equal to 10% of the employee&#x2019;s remuneration. Where the employee is in partnership consisting of, say, four persons, they are jointly allowed to contribute one amount of 10%, and not four times 10%. I hope this is clear. I want to thank him for his contribution.</p>
                        <p>The other point which the hon. Senator mentioned was the importance of bearing in mind the question of inflation, particularly what it could really mean in regard to profits; in other words, the nominal amount and the real amount. In the case of a high inflation rate this of course makes a vast difference. We shall go into the aspects which the hon. Senator mentioned very thoroughly.</p>
                        <p>†I should like to thank the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter for his support of this measure.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the hon. Senator Koch referred to the increase in the deduction for married women from R750 to R900. I cannot say that it is an epoch-making amount, as some of our friends on the Continent like to say, but it is an improvement in the right direction. If I understood her correctly, she said that she might even kiss my hand for that!</p>

I think that is more significant for all taxpayers and quite clearly also for married women. That is much more important and if we can succeed&#x2014;this is my serious aim at any rate and I hope I shall succeed&#x2014;in reducing that still further, then the constructive effect of that on the position of married women will be very clearly seen.</p>
                        <p>As far as the general tax position is concerned, I am sure the hon. Senator Koch will bear in mind that we have also made a substantial concession in the form of a more gradual diminution in the abatements above R5 000 over the whole spectrum. I think that will make a very big difference. The amount that the Treasury loses in that respect alone in one year is about R200 million so that will not be insignificant for many taxpayers. All these concessions taken together will mean a considerable benefit not only to the general taxpayer but certainly also to married women.</p>
                        <p>I think we have also made fairly important improvements in the position of divorced and separated women who have dependants. The tax position has definitely been improved in their case as well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, we try to improve the position from year to year and all being well, we shall see with what we can come up with next year. I fully appreciate the hon. Senator Koch&#x2019;s concern for the position of married women because I think their position needs to be constantly borne in mind. I can assure the hon. Senator that this is something that the Commission on Taxation Policy is constantly considering. The fact that they did this two or three years ago and brought out a very carefully worded report in conjunction with the Department of Inland Revenue does not mean that they have simply left the matter at that. They are constantly reviewing the position. But if the hon. Senator were to. ask me what my first priority is, I would say that it is to bring down the marginal rate of tax for all taxpayers just as much as we can. Once we have achieved something in that respect which we feel is really significant, we can have another look at the specific problems of married women and their taxation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I thank the hon. the Minister for his assurance that he will reconsider my amendment during the recess. He will probably then have more time to have a closer look at it and to obtain further considered opinion on it. I realize that all of us are very busy at this stage of the session and that there is precious little time to look at amendments of this kind. The hon. the Minister will however realize that these Bills come to us at a very late stage of the session and there is nothing that we as an Opposition can do about it. We cannot do anything about getting the Bills earlier and thus being able to bring certain amendments to the notice of the hon. the Minister. When it comes to the question of putting amendments on the Order Paper, I do not think we can put amendments on the Order Paper before a Bill has had its First Reading in the House, so the position is very difficult.</p>
                        <p>I think the hon. the Minister will see the good sense in that amendment of mine when he has another look at it. I think it has a great deal of merit. The hon. the Minister has mentioned certain objections at this stage. We could have a lengthy discussion on those but I do not think that would serve any purpose at this stage of the session.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Koch, in reference to the R900 now deductible from the combined income of a husband and wife, asked for a greater concession in that regard and I think there is merit in her request. She said something else as well which made me realize that men are sometimes foolish but when she said that men were sometimes stingy when it came to handing money over to their wives, I thought that men were sensible people. I do not know how women spend the money. I remember in the olden days when the husbands received their pay-packets they handed those pay-packets over to their wives and the wives gave them a certain allowance. That is not done any more these days.</p>
                        <p>Talking about women&#x2019;s lib, I think there is a certain amount of men&#x2019;s lib as well these days due to the fact that we control our own finances. I would, however, commend to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention this question of working women. It is something that worries us greatly. I realize what the consequences to the Treasury will be if greater concessions are made but the hon. the Minister will also realize what effect this has on productivity, viz. the keeping away of people in the higher income brackets from the labour market. They are as a rule better trained; they are a more specialized type; they are the people we really want to be active in our economy. With these few words, Sir, I support the Third Reading.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the hon. Opposition for the fact that I have been able to introduce this Bill now at such very short notice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, it would not be realistic to assume that the attainment of political independence by Venda will automatically lead to financial independence for that country in the foreseeable future. Venda still finds itself in the position which is characteristic of developing countries. There has been little development in the secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy of Venda, and the contribution made by agriculture, forestry, fisheries and hunting to the gross domestic product of Venda at present still amounts to more than 30%. Moreover, by far the greater part of this contribution comes from the self-supporting sector, i.e. the sector which does not enter the market. As in the case of other developing countries, the paucity of economic activity in Venda is a factor which inhibits the generation of State revenue. It is therefore obvious that Venda will continue to need the financial support of South Africa after it has become independent.</p>
                        <p>It is essential to take a realistic view of the situation of Venda. In an article published by the Africa Institute of South Africa earlier this year, reference was made to the views of the Morse Commission, which reported in 1959 upon the economic requirements of the former High Commission Territories, i.e. the present Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. That commission proceeded from the standpoint that viability did not necessarily imply that a particular country should be able to manage without any financial aid from abroad. However, it does mean that the State concerned should at least be able to finance its current expenditure itself.</p>
                        <p>The Africa Institute pointed out that in terms of this standard Venda could not yet be regarded as viable. This was also the finding of the institute in respect of another principle which is relevant in determining viability, i.e. that a viable State should be able to provide job opportunities for the greater part of its adult labour force.</p>
                        <p>In our consultations about the question of the provision of financial aid to Venda in the future I believe we should be very mindful of these arguments. However, I would like to refer to a few matters in this connection.</p>
                        <p>As far as the question of job opportunities is concerned, it is true that a considerable number of Venda men are still working outside Venda. However, a similar phenomenon is found in other countries which have already attained political independence. In fact, a good example of this is presented by the former High Commission Territories. It is also interesting to note in this connection that the percentage of the Venda population living permanently in that country has increased since 1970 and amounted to approximately 70% in 1977. Although this tendency does not necessarily imply any significant developments in respect of employment in Venda, it does indicate stability as far as the occupation of the country is concerned.</p>
                        <p>During the period from 1971-&#x2019;72 to 1978-&#x2019;79, Venda&#x2019;s own revenue, expressed as a percentage of its total budget, increased by more than 150%. Unfortunately, not enough information is available at the moment to separate Venda&#x2019;s current government expenditure from capital expenditure. However, it goes without saying that the encouraging tendency to which I have just referred would be even more striking if Venda&#x2019;s own revenue could be compared with current expenditure only.</p>
                        <p>There is a further factor which has to be borne in mind. The principle has already been accepted that amounts should be transferred to the Black States equal to the indirect taxes arising from the economic activities in those States. Because of insufficient statistical data, it has not yet been possible to calculate exactly what is due to Venda in respect of customs duties, for example. As a result, only nominal amounts have been transferred to Venda in this connection in the past. However, the necessary surveys are now being made and the position will change considerably after Venda has become independent, when its share of the joint revenue pool of the customs union will be determined on exactly the same basis as those of the other countries to which the customs union arrangements are applicable. Although it is too early to make any projections in this connection, the new developments can be expected to lead to a perceptible increase in Venda&#x2019;s revenue from these sources.</p>
                        <p>With these remarks I have tried to illustrate the positive aspects. However, as I indicated at the very beginning of my speech, there is no doubt about the fact that once Venda has become independent South Africa will have to give financial aid to this new neighbouring State. It is the intention to give this aid in a way that will enable Venda to build the necessary stability into its public finances and to face the future with confidence.</p>
                        <p>†The arrangements which are proposed, Mr. President, do not differ in any material respect from those made when Transkei and Bophuthatswana attained independence. For the convenience of hon. Senators I would, however, like to refer to each of the various clauses very briefly.</p>
                        <p>Clause 1(1):</p>
                        <p>The Black States Constitution Act which at present provides for the transfer of funds to Venda, will cease to apply to that country when it attains independence. The total amount made available for Venda in respect of the 1979-&#x2019;80 financial year, will not yet have been transferred at that stage. Clause 1(1) therefore envisages, firstly, the transfer of the balance of such funds to Venda.</p>
                        <p>Services which at present are carried out on behalf of Venda by Government departments in the Republic, will become the responsibility of Venda on the date of independence. The relevant departments have budgeted for the full 1979-&#x2019;80 financial year and will accordingly experience a surplus in respect of the period from the attainment of independence by Venda until 31 March 1980. It is intended to transfer such funds to Venda as well.</p>
                        <p>Clause 1(1) also provides for the transfer to Venda of any further amounts that may be made available in the Additional Appropriation or by way of Ministerial authorization.</p>
                        <p>Clause 1(2):</p>
                        <p>As in the case of certain Government departments which have budgeted for a full financial year in respect of services in Venda and will stop incurring expenditure in this connection at the time of independence, there may also be other bodies that will have unutilized funds that can be transferred to Venda. Clause 1(2) aims at authorizing the transfer of such funds.</p>
                        <p>Clause 1(3):</p>
                        <p>Taxes paid by citizens of Venda in the Republic, in terms of the Black Taxation Act, are transferred to Venda in terms of the provisions of the Black States Constitution Act. As has been mentioned, when Venda becomes independent, these provisions will cease to be applicable to that country. Clause 1(3) authorizes the transfer to Venda of that portion of such taxes for the 1979-&#x2019;80 financial year which has not been transferred when Venda becomes independent.</p>
                        <p>Clause 1(4):</p>
                        <p>Section 7(1) of the Exchequer and Audit Act, in terms of which additional funds&#x2014; hence funds not included in the budget&#x2014;can be made available by the Minister of Finance for the defraying of expenses does, however, also place a limit on the total amount that can thus be made available. Section 7(2) of the Exchequer and Audit Act also provides that steps should be taken for the voting of such additional funds during the Parliamentary session following upon the date on which the funds are made available by the Minister. Clause 1(4) provides that any additional funds made available for Venda by the Minister of Finance in terms of clause 1(1)(d) will also be subject to the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchequer and Audit Act. This means, in other words, that such additional funds for Venda will be included in the total amount which the Minister can make available in terms of section 7(1) of the Exchequer and Audit Act, that is to say 2 per cent of the relevant budget at the time. Such funds then must also be voted.</p>
                        <p>Clause 2:</p>
                        <p>Clause 2 relates to financial years after 1979-&#x2019;80. In terms of this clause the necessary sanction is obtained for an agreement with Venda in terms of which the following amounts can be transferred to Venda every year, subject to such conditions and for such periods as the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs may determine:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(a) An amount equal to the taxes paid every year by Venda citizens in the Republic in terms of the Black Taxation Act.</li>
                            <li>(b) An amount determined by the Minister of Finance, but not exceeding the total expenditure of the RSA in, or on behalf of, Venda in the 1979-&#x2019;80 financial year&#x2014;i.e. expenditure by normal Government departments and other bodies, for example, the Railways and the Post Office&#x2014;plus an additional amount which Venda will need, in particular to continue with its new services in the 1980-&#x2019;81 financial year, i.e. a full financial year, minus the additional revenue which Venda will receive in the 1980-&#x2019;81 financial year. Once the total amount at issue here has been determined, it shall remain constant. It shall also represent a statutory amount in future estimates.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Clause 2 also provides for the transfer to Venda of any additional amount that may be voted for Venda by Parliament in any specific year.</p>
                        <p>Clause 3:</p>
                        <p>In this clause provision is made for the transfer of certain assets to Venda.</p>
                        <p>Clause 4:</p>
                        <p>It is an accepted principle that assets, in connection with services that become the responsibility of a Black state, are transferred free of charge to the government of such a state. In the case of assets of the Post Office and the Railways and Harbours Administration the intention, however, is to compensate the relevant bodies for assets which are transferred, by reducing the relevant bodies&#x2019; loan debt to the Treasury.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, the House is grateful to the hon. the Minister for the way in which he has explained the provisions of this Bill. He has done so in detail and we appreciate it.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to quarrel with the hon. the Minister about this Bill. The big battle will take place tomorrow or the day after when we discuss the Status of Venda Bill, for this is where the differences in principle lie. My only complaint is that the hon. the Minister is actually putting the cart before the horse by introducing this Bill before the Status of Venda Bill because the hon. the Minister is now guilty of assuming that this hon. House will approve the Status of Venda Bill. This, however, is a theoretical view which I have and I shall not elaborate further upon it.</p>
                        <p>It will of course be necessary for the Republic of South Africa to continue the financial support given to this homeland in the past. There is no argument about that, and we approve of this for various reasons. One of the reasons is that if we do not do so, someone else will do so, and it could be an enemy of the Republic. I will not elaborate on that either as we can discuss all those matters when the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s colleague comes here.</p>
                        <p>†In fact, Sir, this to a very large extent is consequential legislation. We do not have the first legislation in this regard, but this Bill is consequential upon the other Bill being passed. We will therefore have no objection to the passing of this Bill.</p>

Senator Horak said this is putting the cart before the horse, and I can understand that at the end of the session technical problems do arise. I want however to put this question to the hon. the Minister, and I ask it out of ignorance. Can we in fact constitutionally pass a measure of this sort in the House? In other words, can we dispose of property, can we dispose of money to something which in fact does not yet exist?</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, on a point of order: The hon. Senator is debating an incorrect point. He is assuming that we are giving something away, whereas the Bill clearly states that it will be &#x201C;on independence&#x201D;.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator makes my point better than I could make it myself. That is exactly the point. We are being asked to agree to the South African Government donating, selling or disposing of property or money to something which in fact does not exist at this particular point in time. [Interjections.] With the best will in the world, how can I do that?</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, if the Bills had come in the proper order, the other way around, I would have argued and voted against the Status of Venda Bill because I do not agree with it. But after having voted against the Status of Venda Bill, when the hon. the Minister introduced the Financial Arrangements with Venda Bill I would have had to take a different attitude because the first Bill would have been passed and it would be no good arguing against the second Bill because then they would have no funds to meet their commitments. In other words, Sir, my attitude would have been that I would have supported the Bill before us, that is the Financial Arrangements with Venda Bill, having lost&#x2014;as I assume that I am going to lose it&#x2014;my argument on the Status of Venda Bill.</p>
                        <p>I am quite certain that the hon. the Minister can understand my point of view if some of the hon. Senators on the other side cannot. How can I support a Bill in which something is to be disposed of to a body that does not exist? It is as simple as that.</p>
                        <p>But, Sir, I want to ask you on a point of order whether it is in fact constitutional that this Bill can be passed in this manner. I should like ruling on this matter because I do not believe that it is in fact constitutional that it can be done in this way. I know that if this had been arranged differently we would have had the other Bill first, and then I would have been in a different position. But, Sir, all I can ask for is your guidance on whether it is constitutional that this Bill should be dis cussed in this way. I am going to vote against this Bill. [Interjections.] I do not know whether hon. Senators on the other side are blind, Sir. Are they just a charitable institution? Are they prepared to give chunks of South Africa away without any legislation? This is what it amounts to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I should like your guidance in this matter. In my humble way I believe that this is in fact unconstitutional. The hon. the Minister of Finance cannot do it this way. He cannot give away pieces of South Africa without the necessary Bill before us.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I want to thank hon. Senators apart from the hon. Senator Winchester for their support for this Bill. I have already thanked the House for the fact that I was able to proceed with this legislation at short notice.</p>
                        <p>†I do not think there is a constitutional problem. First of all, Venda is a self-governing territory. Secondly, the short title of the Bill states that &#x201C;This Act shall be called the Financial Arrangements with Venda Act, 1979, and shall come into operation on the date of commencement of the Status of Venda Act, 1979&#x201D;. If we approve this legislation it will come into operation only on the date of commencement of the Status of Venda Act.</p>

                        <p>Yes, that is right. On the date the other measure comes into operation, this one will too. I think this disposes of the hon. Senator Winchester&#x2019;s problem.

                        <p>*Mr. President, this motion is being moved to give effect to a unanimous decision of the Committee on Standing Orders of 14 June this year. As will be seen from the motion, it has been decided that the practice of proroguing Parliament at the end of a session will no longer apply, but that the Senate and the House of Assembly will be adjourned until the date on which it is intended to commence the following session. Parliament will then be prorogued on the day prior to the date to which the two Houses stand adjourned. The main object of this new procedure, of course, is to enable select committees to sit during the recess, a need which has long been felt. I wish to point out that this new procedure does not exclude the possibility that to facilitate the work of a select committee the State President may appoint members of a select committee as a commission to proceed with the work of the select committee or certain aspects thereof. For various reasons select committees must sit in the Houses of Parliament in Cape Town, and in cases where a select committee wishes to sit elsewhere, it will be reconstituted as a commission.</p>

                        <p>We are dealing here today with one of our smaller national groups, but at the same time a national group which distinguishes itself very clearly from the other Black nations of South Africa. From what could be established about the early history of the present nation of Venda, it appears that the last immigrants crossed the Limpopo River long before 1700 and settled in the Nzhelele Valley in the vicinity of the Soutpansberg. According to tradition they encountered a local population there called Vhangona, and their descendants still form part of the population of Venda today.</p>
                        <p>The important groups which entered the country, such as Tshivhula, Ndou, Dau and finally Singo are still distinguishable today. For interest&#x2019;s sake it can be mentioned that it was the latter group that built a capital with stone walls&#x2014;Dzata&#x2014;in the Nzhelele Valley and expanded the empire of Thovhele to cover a wide area.</p>
                        <p>Since the earliest times the nation of Venda has been acknowledged as a tightly-knit ethnic unit occupying a small definable area and sharing a great deal of common history, a particular culture and a language&#x2014;Tshi-venda&#x2014;of remarkable uniformity. This language is a very important part of the Venda identity. It is no dialect, but a language in its own right and incomprehensible to its neighbours. Anyone who does not speak this language is not really regarded as one of the people.</p>
                        <p>The Venda are still living today where their forefathers have lived for centuries. As a nation, the Venda never emigrated from their present territory, while other groups did immigrate to Venda and were assimilated into the nation. This nation, as a result of the dry area along the Limpopo and the tsetse fly-infested South-East, remained in isolation to a great degree. Many aspects of the Venda culture, such as social structure and family organization, marriage, inheritance and property ownership, origin in totem groups, agricultural calender and methods, plants cultivated, clothing and other things, especially when seen as a unit, are so unique as to be clearly distinguishable from the culture of other South African ethnic groups.</p>
                        <p>†Venda has always consisted of a number of independent chieftainships and its political situation was rather exceptional for Southern Africa. In Venda there are no tribes in the usual sense where the nation and their ruler form a unit. Here the ruling clan and its territory form a unit, with the commoners forming the movable part. The ruler rules by virtue of inheritance and if a ruler loses his land, he loses everything, including his right to rule.</p>
                        <p>No review of Venda history, however concise it may be, is truly complete without mentioning the considerable influence of Joao Albasini (Tshiwawa), a Portuguese trader and agent of the Transvaal Republic, who in his capacity as Commissioner for Natives made use of armed Tsonga refugees from Mozambique, to maintain law and order in the area, to combat faction fights and to collect taxes imposed by him on tribesmen in the area. A considerable number of these refugees settled along the south side of the Zoutpansberg under Venda chiefs, whose rule they accepted. That concludes the past history of Venda. Politically, Venda developed rapidly in the recent past, by accepting the status of a territorial authority in 1962, the establishment of a legislative assembly during 1971 and the declaration as a self-governing territory in 1973, and today we are dealing with the instrument which shall enable Venda to advance as a fully independent state.</p>
                        <p>On an occasion of this nature it may well be appropriate to view the State in its present form in different fields in an effort to determine the State&#x2019;s ability to adapt and to fit into the commonwealth of nations and to have a glimpse into the future. In contrast with other Black States in the Republic, Venda has an exceptionally high percentage, namely 68% of its 
                            <i>de jure</i> population living within its boundaries and, in addition to that, the Government of Venda is desirous, not only to recognize its people as citizens, but especially to resettle those living in the rural areas, in Venda.
                        </p>
                        <p>*It is worth mentioning that in the economic field, Venda maintained an annual average growth rate of 25,9% in its gross domestic product in the years from 1970 to 1975 and that the share of Blacks in that product was already 90% in 1975. The national per capita income is R228 per annum, and this income increased over the years mentioned above by an annual average of 18,8%. Venda is primarily an agricultural area which also has a very high potential in certain areas for the cultivation of coffee and tea.</p>
                        <p>Up to the present, mining has not played a major role in the economy of Venda, but with the recent discoveries of large coal deposits, this potential, too, has increased considerably. As regards area and population, Venda is a small State, but for the sake of perspective it may be mentioned that a comparison with 28 other small countries&#x2014;10 in Africa and six each in America, Asia and Oceania&#x2014;shows that Venda covers a larger area than 15 of those countries and has a larger population than 17 of them, while it has a lower population density than 18.</p>
                        <p>It is also interesting to note that Venda had a higher per capita income in 1975 than 28 African States and that its real per capita income maintained an average growth rate higher than that of 45 African States. It is also of interest to know that while African States receive an average of R 17,80 per capita of development aid, Venda receives R49,22.</p>
                        <p>As far as the assets of Venda are concerned, all that remains is to discuss the most important asset of the country, i.e. its people. From 1970 to 1977 the number of schools in Venda increased by 40,5% and the number of pupils by 60%, while the pupil-teacher ratio dropped by 30%. During this period the number of post-primary pupils, as a percentage of primary and post-primary pupils, increased with 250% and Venda university students increased by 50%.</p>
                        <p>From these facts one can only conclude that a promising future awaits a nation that looks after its youth in this manner. I take pleasure in wishing Venda the grace of God for their future, and I do so with full confidence.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, with regard to what you have just said, on behalf of this side of the House I want to welcome you back in the Chair to which you were duly elected by this House. I also want to wish you a speedy and complete recovery.</p>
                        <p>In the second place I want to welcome the hon. the Minister and congratulate him on his promotion to full Minister. I am not quite sure in which capacity he is appearing here this morning. It seems to me that he has not as yet relinquished his former office of Deputy Minister; he is still temporarily in that capacity although he is now a full Minister. However, we want to congratulate him on his promotion and wish him everything of the best. A philosopher of old said that there is nothing new under the sun. The truth of that statement is reaffirmed by this debate which is taking place here this morning. This is now the third chapter in the long story of big apartheid, a story which started in 1959 with the announcement of the new policy by the late Dr. Verwoerd in the Other Place.</p>
                        <p>†Twenty years is a long time and we now have the third instalment, the third chapter of the story of big apartheid over that period. I must say the process has been very slow indeed, because we still have several other homelands with which to deal in terms of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Government&#x2019;s policy. The arguments which were used in 1959 on both sides, for and against, are the same arguments which can be used and will be used again today. Because that is so and because there is nothing new under the sun, Mr. President, I am not going to detain this House very long. I could very easily read the speech I made on the Status of the Transkei Bill, or the speech I made on the Status of Bophuthatswana Bill, and there would be very little change necessary in what I said then with regard to what I am about to say now. As I say, I do not want to repeat old arguments which have been thrown across the floor of the House from both sides for many, many years, in fact for 20 years. However, I do want to say one or two things.</p>
                        <p>Before I do so, I want to thank the hon. the Minister for his interesting exposition of the history of the Venda people. They are a very interesting people as the hon. the Minister has said. They are almost unique, in fact, in Africa and in Southern Africa with regard to their background. Their language is very beautiful, not that I understand it but I have heard it spoken because I know that part of the world quite well. It is a beautiful language. Their culture is in fact a unique culture in many respects and they are an interesting people. Therefore, particularly because they are a peace-loving, interesting, docile people, we as their White rulers at this stage, should be very careful about the manner in which we deal with them. We must be quite sure that anything we do is in their long-term interests. That is why I think we should consider this Bill a little more carefully than we had perhaps intended to do earlier.</p>
                        <p>Of course, this Bill emphasizes the basic difference in principle between the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Government and my party with regard to this question of the future of the homelands. I have said before and I say again, that we on these benches have no difference in principle with the Government as regards the political, social and economic development of these homelands. It is an old policy in South Africa. It goes back to 1913, this policy of setting aside areas in which the Black people can live in their nations and of developing those areas and helping them to develop, and of also encouraging political development and growth. There is therefore no basic difference regarding the question of the socio-political, economic development of the Black homelands. There is no difference. Where the difference comes in, is the ultimate situation which these areas should reach. We say we stand for every possible development short of independence. We do not believe that it is in the interests of South Africa as a whole or even of those people as separate national units to become sovereign independent states. We do not believe that this is in their interests for many reasons.</p>
                        <p>In the first place let me come back to Venda and deal with the economic situation of Venda, its economic viability. The hon. the Minister has given us some interesting figures. For instance, he said that the increase in the gross national product of Venda in the past year was 25%. That is very encouraging. But, Sir, my Leader and I sometimes play snooker. When I pot a red ball the score goes up to one on the board. Then, 20 minutes later, I am successful in potting another red ball and then the score goes up to two. Then I say to my Leader: &#x201C;I have improved my position by 100%.&#x201D; So percentages are a little misleading, Mr. President. In fact, percentages can be very misleading, because if one has one thing and one gets another one, one has increased or improved one&#x2019;s situation by 100%. So, although I do believe that there has been some progress in Venda at the economic level, I am afraid that I do not regard that area as an economically viable unit. I listened with great care to what the hon. the Minister said about the economy of Venda but it was clear to me that the hon. the Minister and his senior colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, were certainly not 
                            <i>ad idem</i> on this matter, because the hon. the Minister of Finance introduced a Bill yesterday, which we passed, called the Financial Arrangements with Venda Bill. During the course of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech, which I have here, he said this&#x2014;
                        </p>
                        <block name="quote">Dit sou nie realisties wees om van die veronderstelling uit te gaan dat die verkryging van politieke onafhanklikheid deur Venda outomaties aanleiding sal gee tot die bereiking van finansiële selfstandigheid deur daardie land in die voorsienbare toekoms nie. Venda bevind hom tans nog in &#x2019;n posisie wat kenmerkend van ontwikkelende lande is. Die sekondêre en tersiêre sektore van the ekonomie van Venda het nog nie veel ontwikkeling getoon nie, en die bydrae van landbou, bosbou, vissery en jag tot die bruto binnelandse produk van Venda beloop tans nog meer as 30%. Verreweg die grootste gedeelte van hierdie bydrae kom bowendien van the sektor met eie produksie, d.w.s. the sektor wat nie die mark betree nie. Soos in die geval van ander ontwikkelende lande verteenwoordig die yle voorkoms van ekonomiese aktiwiteit in Venda &#x2019;n faktor wat &#x2019;n stremmende invloed het op die opwekking van staatsinkomste. Dit lê dus voor die hand dat Venda na sy onafhanklikwording nog die finansiële steun van Suid-Afrika sal benodig.</block>
                        <p>Mr. President, we agreed with the last proposition that Venda would for a long time need the financial assistance of South Africa. I said also that if the Republic of South Africa did not make that financial assistance available, somebody else would, and that is another reason why I do not like the sovereign independence concept. I will, however, refer to that again later. The point I want to make now is that I do not believe it is realistic to give sovereign independence to a nation that is not yet economically viable and, in the words of the Minister of Finance, will not be economically viable in the foreseeable future. I do not believe it is realistic and I do not believe it is right. For purely economic reasons, therefore, I do not believe that sovereign independence for Venda is the right policy.</p>
                        <p>It also seems to me that the greatest potential of this country lies possibly in its resources as far as coal deposits are concerned. It certainly is a very fine thing to have coal resources, Sir, but how does a small independent country, not economically viable, deal with those resources? It cannot establish industries based upon coal within its own territory because it does not have the capital or the know-how. It is therefore dependent on exporting that coal to South Africa or somewhere else in order to realize its value. And this independent state is an enclave in the body of South Africa, surrounded by the Republic of South Africa. This state is therefore dependent on the Republic of South Africa for the transport of its coal for export or for the market for its coal. In fact, independence does not mean very much if the state is an economic satellite to that extent.</p>

                    <speech by="#horak">
                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">J. L. HORAK</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>I don&#x2019;t think it was a good thing to give independence to Lesotho. I was one of the people who said that we should incorporate it into the Union, as General Smuts had said. I do not believe Lesotho is economically viable and I do not believe that sovereign independence for Lesotho is a good thing. It has been shown that politically it is not a good thing either. The hon. the Minister is making my case because he will know that in the course of last week the Government of Lesotho opened negotiations with the Communist Republic of Cuba for reciprocal diplomatic representation. The hon. the Minister is making my case. I do not think that is a good development. In fact, I believe it would have been better for all concerned if the Protectorates had become part of the Union of South Africa in a federal arrangement.</p>
                        <p>But to come back to the question of coal, I believe it is no use having potential wealth if you cannot exploit it. Venda will have difficulty in exploiting to the full its resources of coal. It would be far better in economic terms for that territory to remain part of the Repub lic so that it can share in the wealth of South Africa and we can make the best use of the resources that are available there, like coal. So I return to my proposition that it is not good to establish sovereign independent states if they are not economically viable and if they will remain for the foreseeable future, satellites of the Republic in the economic sense. But let me leave the economic field now and come to the political field.</p>
                        <p>First of all I wish to deal with the domestic political field. The hon. the Minister said that 68% of the Venda people are resident in Venda. That is fine and a better percentage than in respect of many of the other homelands. This means that 32% of the Venda people are somewhere else. Some of them will be migrant labourers from Venda to the labour markets in South Africa. Some of them will be situated permanently on White farms. Perhaps the hon. Senator De Jager has some on his farm. Others&#x2014;and this is the residue I always talk about&#x2014;will be permanently situated in the urban areas of the Republic of South Africa. If in political terms independence for Venda is going to be regarded as justification for not extending political rights where they live to those Venda who are permanently resident outside of Venda, then I believe that is not a good deal for the Venda people. If we say to the people of Venda that they have their sovereign independence and that we are going to treat their people working in Johannesburg and in Pretoria and who are permanently resident there as foreign citizens and not as South Africans, I do not think it is a good deal for the Venda people politically. This is a point we always make and I will not labour it.</p>
                        <p>I now come to the question of the international situation. I have just said, with reference to Lesotho, that I am deeply disturbed by the political developments there, but we did not give Lesotho its independence and it is therefore not our fault. I am deeply disturbed by the rapprochement, the agreement between Lesotho and the Republic of Cuba. Heaven knows, if we have a Cuban influence established in Lesotho, we have great trouble. We know what the Cuban influence has done in Africa to the North of us, for example, in Angola and elsewhere. But we have no control over Lesotho. However, the point is that before we pass this Bill we will have control over Venda and there will not be any question of the establishment of a Cuban or other presence there. But if you give a state sovereign independence, and it is an economically non-viable state, you are asking for the intervention of other powers. You put yourself into the position where you will constantly have to outbid those other powers in terms of money.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>The fact that a unit asks for independence is a factor to be considered, but one must look then, as I have said at the political, economic and international situation. One of the most bitter and longest civil wars in history was fought in America towards the end of the last century between the Southern states and the Northern states. The ostensible reason for that war was because the Northern states wanted to abolish slavery in the Southern states. The Southern states wanted to secede from the Northern states. The abolition of slavery was the ostensible reason but that is a simplistic interpretation of that situation. That war came about because the Northern states were afraid of the threat to their economy by the cheap slave labour in the South and the South saw the abolition of slave labour as a threat to their economy. They therefore decided to secede and this war was fought on the question of the right of the Southern states to secede. They wanted to secede, just like Venda has expressed the wish to become independent. But that war was fought, and I am convinced that the economy of America would not have been as flourishing as it has been over the past century if there had been secession. You cannot simply take the desires of people into account in this matter of secession. It is a simplistic concept that you can do that. I am surprised at the liberalism displayed by hon. Senators opposite now. Do they want everybody to do anything they want to do? If the Black people of Soweto say that they want an independent enclave are hon. Senators going to say that they can have one? It is the same thing. I am not impressed by this pseudo-liberalism. I am a practical man and I look at facts and factual situations.</p>
                        <p>Let me get back to the situation in question. What do we do if Venda is misled or bribed into a situation by the offer of huge sums of money to establish relationships, let us say, with Cuba, Communist China or some such agency? What can we do when it is independent? We just have to outbid other agencies continuously, and the poor South African taxpayer will pay the price. The hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell, who is a wealthy man, throws up his hands, indicating that the South African taxpayer must pay the price. Let the hon. Senator go and say that to the people outside!</p>
                        <p>I hope that this will not happen because the Venda people are law-abiding, docile and good people. But how is Transkei going? I do not want to criticize a foreign independent state here, but how is Transkei going? Are we happy that diplomatic relations have been broken off? I foreshadowed that that would happen years ago, in 1960 in the Other Place. I said that we must be careful about the international political future of the Xhosa, because the Xhosa is a fiercely independent chap. If it suits him he is going to enter into alliances with all sorts of elements hostile to South Africa. I said that, and it is happening. This is not a good policy and it is specifically also not a good policy because it deprives the people concerned of their right to share in the economic wealth of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
                        <p>*One hand washes the other. These homelands, as part of the Republic, are helping us in the Republic to promote the economic interests of all our people. But if we fragment excise and separate, we make it difficult for those people to make the economic progress which they would have made if they had remained an integral part of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
                        <p>†The whole situation in Europe at the moment is towards closer unity, and not towards partition and fragmentation. That is the trend in Europe. They are going to find a European Parliament; it was elected the other day.</p>

                        <p>Must I give the hon. gentleman a lecture on Rhodesia? Do you know what the mistake was that was made with the federation of Rhodesia? They made it a geographical federation; they simply took three elements in which the White people were in the minority in each element and they said: &#x201C;This is a federation.&#x201D; That is no good. That is the federation my friends of the PFP propose. We say we want a race federation. We want Venda as a separate unit but we want it part of a federal arrangement. We want it to run its own affairs but we want it to be under the control of the umbrella authority of the Republic of South Africa. That is our attitude, and in that umbrella authority it will have a voice; it will have a say. We say that sovereign independence is a dangerous, reckless, economically non-viable policy. We have said it for 20 years and we shall continue to say it. So the hon. the Minister and I must agree to differ on this matter.</p>
                        <p>*I do not want to repeat all the arguments I have used over the years with regard to this matter but in conclusion I say that we are of the opinion that the policy of sovereign independence for the homelands is a foolish policy and history will prove it. Developments in Lesotho and Transkei are already proving this. That is our attitude and therefore we cannot support the Bill.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, in the first place it is a great pleasure for us on this side of the House to welcome you back. The loss of one&#x2019;s voice is a severe professional risk for politicians and we wish you a speedy recovery. In the second place we want to congratulate the hon. the Minister who introduced this Bill this morning&#x2014;yet another of our historic measures&#x2014; on his promotion. We are pleased that he has appeared here in spite of his promotion because he played an exceptionally important part in the formulation of this measure. I shall remember the hon. the Minister as one of those people who knows probably every piece of land in South Africa. He has worn out his shoes tramping over the whole of South Africa in his years of service as Deputy Minister in charge of the consolidation of the Black areas and, prior to that, as a member of the commission. Perhaps I am expressing an idle wish when I say that as the governments of the homelands become independent, perhaps they could provide some wet cement slabs so that those people who have left their footprints on the road to the development and establishment of those homelands could leave their footprints there as well. Then our Minister Hartzenburg would be one of those people whose footprints would be imprinted there.</p>
                        <p>As far as this measure is concerned, we on this side of the House will not take up much time debating it for the simple reason that this is a proud moment for us in that this morning we are laying the basis for the establishment of the third sovereign independent Black state within the geographical area of South Africa. This is the third step in which I personally and we as a party&#x2014;in spite of all the hon. Senator Horak might say&#x2014;believe honestly, sincerely and without compromise, namely the establishment of a South Africa of fatherlands, Black fatherlands as well as a White fatherland.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">A. M. VAN SCHOOR</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Du Toit can say what he likes but that is our pride and that is our idealism for ourselves and for our Black nations in South Africa. What really struck me here this morning was the information the hon. the Minister gave. The hon. Senator Horak is correct when he speaks of figures and percentages. Percentages might sound impressive, but the hon. the Minister went further. The hon. Senator did not even mention this. The hon. the Minister drew comparisons with acknowledged, recognized states in the United Nations, and I say to the hon. Senator Horak this morning that the names of Transkei, Bophuthatswana and Venda have more right to be included on that list of states in the United Nations, to parade before that wonderful forum than many other member states. I say further that when we compare our Black leaders with the persons in the United Nations today we can be proud of the quality of the personalities of our Black leaders. As a member of the White Republic of South Africa I believe and I am convinced that we have good reason to feel proud because the quality of the leaders of our two independent states and that of those of the emergent independent territories is much higher than that of many of the leaders already recognized in the United Nations. That is our attitude towards our Black people in South Africa. That is our pride.</p>
                        <p>We know the arguments of the hon. Senator Horak and that is why I say that I do not want to devote much time to them this morning. Today we see the fulfilment of yet another of the major steps in the policy of my party, of my government, a policy we believe in, and which I think is to the good not only of a greater South Africa but also of the individual nations and member states. I do not want to go into the arguments raised by the hon. Senator Horak because we know them. I may just tell him that I always listen to him very carefully but in this case I cannot accept his arguments. The past 20 years have shown that the arguments they have advanced against the independence policy, this abolition of guardianship policy, of the National Government have been refuted by reality and will be refuted even further.</p>
                        <p>He may be right theoretically when he says that Venda and certain other of our emergent Black states will not be economically viable. That may be so, Mr. President, but he knows better than I do that economic viability has never been accepted and recognized internationally as a test for sovereignty. More than three-quarters of the member states of the United Nations are not economically viable. On the contrary, such a deplorable situation has been created that a strong movement has arisen over the years&#x2014;which will not succeed because the voting count is against it&#x2014;that the voting strength in the United Nations should be determined by a country&#x2019;s economic strength and not on the basis of individual membership. Even the international community does not accept the economic argument of the hon. Senator Horak. Even less can I accept all the risks he paints and which he has projected over the years regarding independence for our Black nations and our Black territories as against his party&#x2019;s policy of independent units but within a sort of federal relationship. I could paint the risks attaching to independence for Black nations much better than he does himself. We are fully aware of those risks but we and the Black nations are very much aware of the risks involved in the policy of his party and particularly in the policy of the party of the hon. Senator Winchester. When we talk of risks we need only refer to the recent collapse, instability and chaos in certain countries.</p>
                        <p>The international community refuses to recognize our independent nations; it refuses to recognize Zimbabwe-Rhodesia; it is trying to out-manoeuvre us in the matter of independence for the nations of South West Africa and it wants to hand that country over to foreign Swapo forces. The fact of the matter is that in its own history the United Nations has recognized the principle of separation of sovereignty, even where there is no difference in regard to religion, colour or anything else, as was the case in the old Pakistan which is now divided into Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>We must look at our situation in South Africa. My party and the Government and I personally are proud to give our blessing to this Bill. We realize that we live in a world of risks but, when we weigh the potential against the risks, then I say that I believe in the quality of our Black leadership and our Black nations. There will be problems; we cannot expect this to be an easy task. But no matter what problems may arise, I believe in the quality of White and Black leadership in Southern Africa to move together in independence, in separate independencies, to a future where we will form an association of states in Southern Africa based on our communal interests.</p>
                        <p>I know that Transkei might ask the Cubans to open an embassy there tomorrow but I do not think it will happen for the simple reason that the demand for communal interests for everybody in Southern Africa is irresistible. It will work like a magnetic force and help us solve all our problems and overcome the risks. That is why I say with joy and with pride that my side of the House wholeheartedly supports this Bill.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Yes. But I really expected something better from the hon. Senator Van Schoor. He treated this matter with great moral justification, this matter of the independence of the Venda people. However, this is all so much eyewash and the hon. Senator knows it. The real issue involved is that the NP Government came to the conclusion in the 1950s&#x2014;under the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2014;that it could never hope to continue to govern South Africa as a White political party; it could not continue to govern the whole of South Africa. The NP Government was unprepared and unwilling to share the political rights it enjoyed in South Africa with any other group. This is really the whole crux of the matter, Sir. We have had the argument that the White group was not the smallest group in South Africa; the Black people have been divided into many tribes and nationalities in an effort to show that the Whites are not, in fact, the smallest group. But it became obvious to the NP that they could not continue to govern South Africa as a whole in peace and that the only way was to bring about separation, and separation, as the hon. Senator Horak has said, was grand apartheid. This is all that it means. The whole purpose of this Bill which establishes a third independent homeland, is merely to fragment South Africa further because the Government is unwilling, politically, to share South Africa with all the people within its borders. This is all it amounts to. If hon. Senators opposite wanted to be frank with this House, they would admit that this was the reason. This is, in fact, the only reason why we have Bills of this nature. There is no other argument; there can be no other argument. All it amounts to is that the Government is not prepared to share the political rights in South Africa with any other race group.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Yes, certainly. Whether the Government is prepared to do so or not, Mr. President, is not the issue. I am saying to hon. Senators opposite that regardless of any philosophy they may have, regardless of the number of Black states they may establish in South Africa, I believe the time will come when we as White people in South Africa will have to find a basis of sharing political rights. And I mean all of South Africa, Sir, not that part that has been broken up into little bits and pieces. Whether that happens under a dispensation of the NRP or the party that I represent or a combination of the two with the NP, it will come. I believe that what Bills of this nature do, is merely to postpone that day and add greater dangers to the natural process that will ultimately take place in South Africa. Whether it will come under a confederation or under a federation, I do not know, but sooner or later it will come about. If their argument is, in fact, correct, then they cannot deny an independent homeland to the Coloureds of South Africa and they cannot deny an independent homeland to the Indian people of South Africa. You and I know, Sir, how ridiculous it is even to think along those lines because if that were to be the position, then Durban would have to be part of an Indian homeland and Cape Town would have to be part of a Coloured homeland. One can take this to ridiculous extremes, Sir! The Government is not prepared to face that possibility but in the meantime it takes a small group like the Vendas, a small country that is not viable economically and that is completely dependent upon South Africa, and tries to cast them aside saying: &#x201C;Now we have solved that situation.&#x201D;</p>
                        <p>What is really revealing in their whole argument&#x2014;and the hon. Senator Van Schoor has had the moral and political courage to admit it&#x2014;is that they say that the time will come, as a previous Minister, Dr. Connie Mulder said last year, when there will be no Black South Africans. That is Government policy. The whole intention is to turn around and say: There are no Black South African therefore we are not discriminating against Blacks. That then will bear out what Dr. Koornhof has just said in the United States, namely, that there is no discrimination in South Africa, because all the Blacks will then have their own homelands, their own sovereign independent States. That is why I say that what the hon. Senator Van Schoor has said is eye-wash and I believe that in his more reflective moments he will admit that it is eye-wash. All this Bill is about, Sir, is that the Government is not prepared to share South Africa politically with the other groups that live in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Here I want to interrupt myself to congratulate the hon. the Minister. I offer him my very sincere congratulations on his promotion in the Cabinet. I welcome it because I believe the hon. the Minister attempts within the confines of Government policy to do his best. I welcome him to his new post and congratulate him.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister gave us figures to show the number of states which are smaller in area, smaller in national wealth and so forth than Venda. I am not going to dispute any of his figures in that regard. But can he name any one of the states he mentioned that is as integrated economically and politically with another country as the Venda people are with South Africa? I would venture to suggest that not one of them is. Some of them are islands, in fact, and are completely divorced and separated from their neighbours. So to use that as a comparison, I believe, is a fallacious argument. If one looks at the Bill and tries to ignore the two previous Bills that conferred independence on two other states, then one must agree with what the hon. Senator Horak has said, namely, that it will be independent in name only. The Bill further fragments South Africa and it solves not a single problem. For 20 years we have been dealing with this problem. Can the hon. the Minister tell me that South Africa is internally better off politically than it was 20 years ago? Have we fewer problems, fewer troubles than we had 20 years ago? Are we better off internationally than we were 20 years ago, now that this will be the third state to which we have given sovereign independence?</p>

                        <p>I will deal with their political rights. The hon. Senator Dempsey asked what will happen if they ask for independence. But what alternative do they have? They are denied political rights in South Africa. They are denied them for all time. What else can they do? What</p>
                        <p>else can they ask for but independence? Give them the choice between political rights in South Africa and independence, and one will soon know what they will ask for. There are people in this House who are better qualified than I to say what Chief Buthelezi&#x2019;s claim has been all along. Why has Chief Buthelezi, the head of the most powerful of the African states within South Africa, not asked for independence? Why has Chief Buthelezi, the head of the most viable economically, the most politically advanced state among the Black races in South Africa, not asked for political independence? It is because he has made the point, and I think he makes the point for so many others, that he wants rights in the whole of South Africa. He wants political rights in the whole of South Africa. This is what must come regardless of what the Nationalist Party are trying to do by introducing legislation of this sort. That is the answer to the hon. Senator Dempsey.

                        <p>Anybody who looks at this Bill in 20 or 30 years&#x2019; time, will see that by actions of this sort, by their support for hon. Senators opposite were jeopardizing the future and the interests of South Africa.</p>

                        <p>Yes. There are very serious dangers. But the Government policy of believing that they can fragment and so secure South Africa is a fallacy. This was tried in Europe in 1848 and it resulted in something of the order of 60 years of continual war. I am saying to the hon. Senators opposite, that is what is going to happen in South Africa. The Balkanization of Europe created unending wars and unbelievable horrors. And that is what these hon. Senators opposite are trying to bequeath to our future generations. [Interjections.] They do not seem to learn from history. I believe that the whole crux of this matter, as I said earlier on, is simply because they will deny as far as they can political rights to all the other race groups. It is a question of permanent White domination of South Africa as we know it. [Interjections.] And if South Africa shrinks in the process to the stage where ultimately the Whites can dominate just a tiny little island in the Black mass, the Black sea around us, they will say that their policy has succeeded. [Interjections.] Mr. President, they may succeed that way but they will have destroyed South Africa completely and they will have endangered the lives of the people that they claim to be protecting. This I believe is the horrifying thing about a Bill of this nature. It offers sovereign independence in name only. It offers a title without any substance and without any foundation. [Interjections.] And herein lies the danger. In their pursuit of this ideal of White domination &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>I too believe that one can lead a territory such as Vendaland and other territories in South Africa to a degree of autonomy. There can be a degree of decentralization. However, there must be one controlling federal government or confederal government, whatever name or title one wishes to give it. The time will come, and I have said this before in this Chamber, when there will be people of other races sitting in this Chamber. The only salvation for the White people of South Africa will be for them to have the courage to realize that what they have they can only keep if they learn to share it. Therefore I must oppose this legislation.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. L. ODENDAAL</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want to associate myself right at the outset with the previous speakers in addressing a word of hearty congratulations to the hon. Minister who is present here and to wish him everything of the best&#x2014;we know him and have full confidence in him&#x2014;in the future handling of the particular department which now falls under his control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, there was nothing new in the speech of the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat. In fact, we have heard that same argument hundreds of times here across the floor. It is quite useless to waste one&#x2019;s time in trying to reply to it. That is his ideology of consociation, of a unitary state and of human rights, of one man, one vote and so on, which finds no practical echo anywhere in the world and which is not realistically practicable. I think that the Opposition has no conception&#x2014;I really mean the party of the hon. Senator who spoke before I did&#x2014;of what it means for a nation to have its own freedom and independence and sovereignty, its right to self-determination and full citizenship, i.e. to have its own inherited fatherland. We on this side of the House and everybody who is realistic can appreciate this because we experienced the loss of freedom along a bloody road and its eventual recovery by constitutional and peaceful means. We know the value of sovereign independence and complete freedom. If one has no feeling for freedom, for nationality and national dignity, then one might argue like the hon. Senator who spoke before me. We who know freedom and who know what it is to lose it and get it back later can appreciate this. Our full sympathy and our best wishes go to the Venda nation upon the attainment of their sovereign independence as embodied in this short and explicit measure. This is undoubtedly a historic happening in our country&#x2019;s history.</p>
                        <p>The Venda nation at its own request is becoming independent, without any bloodshed, without any struggle or strife having preceded it. The hon. Senator who spoke before me, of course, still thinks in the imperialistic way. He thinks in terms of a unitary state within certain borders. He thinks like our ancestors or our former conquerors thought, viz. that one can throw everybody together into one state regardless of their colour or the language they may speak. We must remember that South Africa is the country in the world today with the greatest complexity of cultures and ethnicities in the whole world. We could throw all the nations of South Africa together and conglomerate them and form a consociation&#x2014;or whatever it might be called&#x2014;instead of the so-called fragmentation of South Africa. They want to keep South Africa whole, and this is evidenced by the arguments advanced by the hon. gentlemen. They are afraid that they might lose their riches. What are their real motives? It does not matter to us if great riches lie buried underground in these states. We have good reason to believe that there are such riches but we do not begrudge them to the Venda nation. If they can develop their agricultural potential to the full we do not begrudge them this sincerely, just as we claim it for ourselves. The question has already been put here and I repeat it. Why did we not object at the time to the independence of the British protectorates in South Africa? Most of them are less viable than Venda is at the moment. Leabua Jonathan, for instance, said that all that the former regime had left his country were a club and a few trout in the streams. In my view Venda is far more viable than the former British protectorates. The hon. the Minister has given us a brief insight into the possibilities of these states. They have a good rainfall and a very good agricultural potential and they have also shown that they have a really effective growth potential.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, if the official Opposition here and in the Other Place continue with their idea of a conglomerate or consociation, a unitary state, they must surely be blind to what is going on in the rest of the world. I want to say a few words in this regard. They are just as blind as the United Nations because nowhere in the world&#x2014;and I challenge hon. Senators to dispute this&#x2014;has a conglomerate existed permanently, except of course in countries such as Africa and elsewhere&#x2014; and we are aware of these&#x2014;where it was not maintained by force and domination. Black Africa, for instance, in the twenty years of its gaining independence, has had no fewer than 40 
                            <i>coups d&#x2019;état.</i> I want to read to you, Sir, what a Black Ghanaian student wrote recently in 
                            <i>The Chicago Tribune</i> of America about the position in Africa&#x2014;
                        </p>
                        <block name="quote">In Black Africa there is actually little of the majority rule being demanded from those beleaguered White-run countries (here he means South Africa and Rhodesia). Instead there is for the most part only tyranny presided over by self-proclaimed kings, army juntas or military dictators, governments in which the bulk of the people have absolutely no voice.</block>
                        <p>We could give countless instances where people have been thrown together under the same roof and given so-called democratic freedom but where it still served no purpose, e.g. Cyprus and Belgium, and Canada where after hundreds of years the British and French are still not one nation and the French are insisting on their own independent state. Even the Red Indians in Northwest Canada are now beginning to demand their own state. The United States with its so-called forced integration, e.g. on the educational level, and their Bill of Rights of 1966, is another example. Prof. Hutchinson recently told a Tucsa congress here that the result of this has been that the Black ghettos in the American metropolitan complexes are still on the increase and that the situation is becoming untenable. We know too that New York&#x2019;s bankruptcy is due mainly to the fact that many thousands of Blacks there are unemployed and have to receive unemployment allowances. That is the result of human rights and freedom. Their compulsory integration on the educational level is a complete failure, as I have just shown by quoting American experts.</p>
                        <p>Old imperial India had to remain united. This led to a bloody war which cost more than a million lives before India was divided into three states along the normal ethnic and religious lines. Now there is peace. I am mentioning only a few examples but there are dozens. I am not even talking of Africa and the East where nations, as in old colonial Africa, have been artificially and forcibly brought together. Borders have simply been drawn arbitrarily and everybody living in that particular area is called a nation. We say peoples are nationalities, they are entities, ethnic groupings, and that is where our interest lies. The nations in old colonial Africa enjoyed no freedom, only tyrannical oppression and disintegration. In Africa there has been hardly any progress and even economic decline.</p>
                        <p>The idea of a consociation or a unitary state where many ethnic groups are thrown together is doomed from the start, and I want to refer to what Bishop Tutu told us recently&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Die idee van die PFP om &#x2019;n unitêre start te vorm waarin the regte van die minderheidsgroepe sogenaamd verskans sal word, is vir die Swartmense nie die papier werd waarop dit geskryf staan nie.</block>
                        <p>They can forget about it. The majority will govern and they will be under the heel of the Blacks.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to the aforementioned chaotic situation where a conglomeration of nations is thrown together, this Bill envisages something positive, the most positive position we can reasonably and sensibly accept. And that is the granting of freedom, independence and dignity to the Venda nation which traditionally is a humanitarian, positive and dignified nation. We recognize their independence and we rejoice with them on its attainment. The Bill before the House recognizes the attainment of freedom by democratic, bloodless and constitutional means. It recognizes the birthright of a nation to be itself, to live its life according to its own culture, traditions, morals and customs. It envisages positive good neighbourliness and mutual co-operation with the Republic of South Africa, their motherland. That is the honourable, Christian, ethical and rational solution as regards the concept of independent, mature, independent nations. That is the right of the Vendas, that is their desire, that is their hope, and it is our privilege to give it to them. It is our joy to be able to give it to them. We assure them that South Africa will not leave them in the lurch but will stand by them as in the past, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, as laid down in the Bill adopted here yesterday. We are in earnest that they should
                        </p>
                        <p>be free. We grant it to them wholeheartedly and we welcome this legislation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, permit me to address you before I deal with the legislation. As I was not here to welcome you the other day, I should like to do so now. I hope that you will have a peaceful time in this hon. House. Often you will notice the younger Senators sleeping, and that is something the President may do as well. I assure you that no one will wake you. When I came to this House for the first time there was an hon. Senator here who knew the protocol very well. The first lesson we had to learn in the Senate of those days, he put this way: &#x201C;Gentlemen, you never wake the President.&#x201D; Mr. President, if after a good lunch you feel like dozing off for 10 or 15 minutes, we shall not disturb you, we assure you.</p>
                        <p>I should also like to convey my congratulations to the new Minister of Education and Training. I hope he will always hold the name of the Western Transvaal high, and I wish him every success for the future. As far as the hon. Senator Odendaal is concerned, I shall make no comment on his argument with the hon. Senator Winchester. But I would like to say to the hon. Senator Odendaal that I regard this third piece of legislation granting independence to a Black state within the borders of our beloved fatherland as a flight from reality as far as the Nationalist Party is concerned. The NP will not look facts in the face. Hon. Senators opposite speak of one White South Africa but I want to ask them where that so-called White South Africa is. An MP of the old United Party once said something in the Other Place which I think hon. Senators must take to heart He said&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>Where does that hon. Senator come from? I think we should send him back to the Free State. The fact remains that the urban Black man has helped to develop South Africa and he wants to share in the benefits. If we want to be honest with ourselves we must say that they can share in it. We must not fragment South Africa; we should rather let these people share in the economic benefits of the country as a whole. That is what these people really want. In this connection I should once again like to point out that my old party did not deviate from its policy over the years, and neither has it done so up today. That is as clear as daylight. We are willing to develop the so-called homelands to their fullest potential so that they can offer a good living to the greatest number of Black people. But we cannot imagine that fragmenting South Africa is going to solve our problems in this connection. I am glad to see therefore that the Minister of Co-operation and Development has also broadcast some federation stories. [Interjections.]</p>

                        <p>I know hon. Senators opposite would like to do that to the Opposition but they will find it a little difficult. A further aspect is that we must compare the viability of Venda with that of other states, for instance Bophuthatswana. Bophuthatswana has probably the best potential for development and economic independence of all three of these units. What did Chief Mangope say when he accepted independence? He did not accept independence because the Tswanas wanted to be independent. Hon. Senators know very well what he said and I do not want to repeat everything. He said he accepted independence because to his mind it was apparently the only way to get rid of apartheid. There is also another difference between Bophuthatswana and Venda. [Interjections.] He also spoke of that hon. Senator because he is also one of the practitioners of discrimination which Chief Mangope did not like. He particularly did not like the hon. Senator&#x2019;s former newspaper. The other point we must put very clearly here is that Bophuthatswana has stated&#x2014;I am pleased to be able to say this because it is being said by other states in South Africa which will become independent&#x2014;that it does not want the Whites out of its territory, because it knows it can use the ability of the Whites. Chief Mangope proved this by appointing three Whites in his cabinet.</p>

                        <p>His Ministers of Health and Justice and his chief adviser on agriculture are Whites. Bophuthatswana possesses a far greater potential than Venda does in many spheres and the attainment of independence was probably not such a bad step for them to take. But Venda is in a much weaker position to utilize independence. This reminds me so much of people who ask for bread and are given the franchise. The hon. the Minister said that there are coal deposits in Venda but that territory is very isolated and has almost no road system or transport facilities. Venda will remain completely dependent on the Republic of South Africa in this respect. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has said that the per capita assistance supplied to Venda is as high as R49,22. I support the idea that we must help those territories to develop as far as possible so that they can achieve their full potential. But if that includes sovereign independence I must protest because I do not think the people of Venda appreciate it.</p>
                        <p>I want to put a last question to the hon. the Minister. Has the land dispute between Venda and Gazankulu been settled? A few years ago there was a dispute between these two territories in regard to an area of land adjoining the Letaba River which was formerly State land. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister if the matter has been settled. I shall not repeat all the arguments which the other side of the Senate have advanced over the years. I just want to say that I think this is a sad day and I think that most of the Vendas will eventually agree with us. I have no choice but to vote against this legislation.</p>

                        <p>The previous speaker on the Opposition side, the hon. Senator Winchester, donned the mantle of a prophet and with a display of foreknowledge stuttered out a prophecy of doom for South Africa, which, if one thinks about it, could almost reduce one to tears. He reminds one of the Egyptian hieroglyphics; it takes one a lifetime to understand them and then one still does not understand them so un-Western are they. And that applies to that hon. friend. As far as the other speaker, the hon. Senator Horak, is concerned, and his idea of development but not complete independence for Venda, I shall say something about him at the end of my speech.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, there has been so much repetition of the arguments advanced in previous debates regarding Transkei&#x2019;s and Bophuthatswana&#x2019;s independence that it is really unnecessary for us to argue too comprehensively after the replies which were advanced to those arguments from this side. I thought therefore it might be as well to give a short summary in six or seven minutes of the attitude in principle of the governing party in this country regarding the granting of independence to Black states. Thank heavens three or four parties are not governing simultaneously in this country; it would cause a Babelic confusion, Mr. President, the sort of Babelic confusion into which a man like Senator Winchester would fit well. You know, 3 800 years have gone by from the time of Abraham until today, and about the same length of time has elapsed since the Babelic confusion took place, and after all these years he has still not learned his lesson. I do not think he would learn it if he lived for another 3 800 years. The NP has a certain policy which does not make it a tyrant over other people, which the hon. Senator has accused us of being. Therefore it will do the opposition parties good to remember this tomorrow: The NP policy in regard to Black states is based on the Christianly justifiable principle of development and self-determination which results in the principle that we do not believe there can be protection for minority nations within a unitary set-up. The only other policy, the one of a unitary form of state, can have only one consequence, and that, as certain as we stand here this morning, will most certainly mean that they will go under and be destroyed and lose their nationhood for ever. The opposition parties can be certain that the NP will accept no federal or confederal system, no matter what the form, but rather a kind of commonwealth of Southern African states later, about which we do not want to hold a discussion here now. While the federal system may have succeeded overseas and may still succeed, the South African situation is not a parallel situation; it is completely different. The consequences of such a system would be diametrically opposite here to what they are in those countries.</p>

                        <p>We could say again: Think back to the federal system which they tried to bring into being in Rhodesia; it lasted ten years and it was a failure. In so far as the Black man in the urban areas is concerned, we only want to repeat that in terms of NP policy they are and remain linked, tied to their mother nation in the homelands, and whether you or I think otherwise, they themselves know that that is so. They feel and bear witness to the fact that they do not constitute a real part of the White&#x2019;s different political set-up of which they were traditionally, to some extent, a part in the past. We want to change this. The NP policy is a logical and well-considered one and that policy has been put here time without number: Nations with specific national and cultural characteristics can only reach full maturity and enjoy guaranteed national survival in their own indigenous self-determining and constitutional unit. It is impossible otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Therefore our call is&#x2014;and on this note I want to conclude&#x2014;independence for the Black states; independence now for Venda, which has asked for it itself! The Venda nation do not want to be sucked up to and become a sham unit in a larger unit of a restless constitutional national set-up. At election after election the White electorate has returned us to this Parliament on the basis of that policy, and the Opposition expects us to do otherwise here.</p>
                        <p>Then senseless things are said such as those said here by the hon. Senator Winchester. He really reminded me of one of the wonderful men from the fatherland who sang one of the verses of the National Anthem thus: &#x201C;Ek sal lewe, jy sal sterwe, ons vir jou Suid-Afrika.&#x201D; That is the sort of principle he brings up. Sir, the Vendas are just as much Black nationalists as the Zulus or any of our other Black nations here in South Africa. And if you were to say to a Zulu: &#x201C;You are not a Black nationalist&#x201D;, and he knew what it meant, he would say to you (written phonetically): &#x201C;Oe na mangha.&#x201D; That is not true. And if you were to say it to a Sotho, he would say: &#x201C;Oea kala lesjakoe.&#x201D; You lie; that is not true. And if you were to say it to a Venda he would say: &#x201C;Wha zuwhiefa&#x201D;&#x2014;you lie. I do know something of their languages. [Interjections.] Yes, and one other. I could ask Senator Winchester, just as I ask the Venda. &#x201C;Dienjie oe maghahoe?&#x201D; Who made you? Where do you come from? One can see he was not born in this country and he has not been raised in the thought patterns of these South African national compositions and individual nations. We do not begrudge other nations what we claim for ourselves, Mr. President. The hon. Senator Horak spoke of homeland development. But he says they must only develop. We must take them a little way but we must not in reality take that development to the full expression of freedom and stability. This reminds one of what was said about students of the University of Stellenbosch in the old days. They always went on tour with Afrikaans plays and when they went to Namaqualand in the old days on the first tour one of them saw a young girl. We were all like that when we were young. He fondled her and flirted with her a little and when he came back on the next tour he thought she would still be willing, and he began again. But she said: &#x201C;No, definitely not.&#x201D; So he said: &#x201C;But I do not understand why you are like this. Last time we were here you were so nice.&#x201D; Then she said: &#x201C;No&#x201D;, and in that typical Namaqualand idiom which was used at that time, &#x201C;Not you Stellenbosch boys; you just &#x2018;njarrie&#x2019; us; you never &#x2018;njammie&#x2019; us.&#x201D; Which means &#x201C;you flirt with us but you never marry us&#x201D;. They say they want a sort of development of the Black states; they want to &#x201C;njarrie&#x201D; them, flirt with them; but they do not want to &#x201C;njammie&#x201D; them, give them independence. They are frightened to death of it. There is a Cuba and there is a this and a that which spells danger. Sir, we do not have a &#x201C;njarrie&#x201D; policy; the NP has the &#x201C;njammie&#x201D; policy for complete independence for nations created by God. We want to give those nations what we claim for ourselves. That is why, Sir, we cannot do otherwise than support future independence for Venda.</p>

He said, for instance, that the NP did not believe in a federal or confederal system. I shall talk to him about this later. There will be three parliaments under the new dispensation they speak of, and the hon. Senator Fick said that the day must never dawn when there is more than one government in the country. But how many parliaments, how many governments, will there be?</p>

                        <p>You said: What would happen to South Africa if that happened? That is what the hon. Senator Fick said. I cannot compete with him when he starts to tell jokes but what the NP wants to do to South Africa reminds me of the young married couple who had a baby. The wife was rather sick and it was decided that she would go away for a week. She went away and the husband had to look after the baby for the week-end. The first evening the neighbour heard the baby crying all the time. The child cried so much that after a while he went to see what was the matter. When he entered the house he went to the bathroom and found the father bathing the baby. The father had the baby by the ears and he was lifting the baby in and out of the bath. Then the neighbour said: &#x201C;No nobody baths a baby like that; you put one hand under the head and the other under the hips and then immerse him gently in the water.&#x201D; Then the father said: &#x201C;But you don&#x2019;t realize how hot the water is.&#x201D; Mr. President, that is what the NP is doing to South Africa. They do not want to burn their own hands and that is why South Africa is being pulled by the ears through hot water.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister quoted figures to show how Venda compares with other backward states in Africa. I do not think that is a good comparison, Sir. Can you imagine, Sir, what the comparison would have been had Venda remained part of South Africa? The hon. the Minister said that Venda had a higher per capita income than 28 other African states and that the percentage increase in income had been higher than that in 50 other African states. How much better would it not have been had Venda remained part of South Africa? Then the increase would not only have been higher than that of 50 African or backward states but it would also have been higher than that of many countries in the world.</p>
                        <p>I should like to refer to the mineral wealth of South Africa and how this fragmentation of the country will prejudice the whole of South Africa. South Africa is particularly rich in minerals, Sir; South Africa has so to speak a monopoly of certain strategic minerals outside the Soviet Union. But this fragmentation hampers the possibility of South Africa&#x2019;s becoming an industrial power in the world with all its steel, coal, etc. South Africa possesses between 60% and 70% of the world&#x2019;s supply of chrome. Zimbabwe-Rhodesia possesses about 25% and the Soviet Union possesses about 5%. If this proposal goes through, it will mean that South Africa will lose about 80% of its resources. At the present moment about 70% of South Africa&#x2019;s resources are to be found in Lebowa and Bophuthatswana.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, given the position of diminishing petrol reserves and supply problems of crude oil, coal and uranium South Africa can be expected to provide an increasing share in the energy requirements of industrial nations. While South Africa may have only 1% to 3% of the world&#x2019;s reserves of coal, it is deemed sufficient to sustain industrial growth into the 22nd century.</p>
                        <p>*Sir, 71% of South Africa&#x2019;s coal reserves are situated in the Eastern Transvaal and the Free State, 25% in the Northern Transvaal and only 3% in Natal. If we accept that much of these coal deposits is to be found in Venda and Lebowa, it means that South Africa will lose these resources and our position will then &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>But that is the truth. I say that much of these resources will be lost as a result of fragmentation. Those resources will not belong to South Africa. That is what it is all about.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, in conclusion I just want to say that the economic and social well-being of the Republic will be crucially dependent on an adequate supply of minerals for future industrial might and on foreign earnings from the sale of minerals. By cutting itself off from its most valuable mineral resources, the Republic will be committing what amounts to economic and industrial suicide.</p>
                        <p>*Mr. President, it is obvious that we are weakening our position in South Africa and in the world if we continue with this fragmentation of South Africa. It will mean that the mineral resources and riches of South Africa will be lost. We shall no longer be in a position to compete with other countries on the world market. These smaller states which own the minerals will be able to enter into treaties with other powers, Eastern powers. That is what will happen and that is what it will mean if we proceed with the legislation before this House today.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I shall not take up much of the time of the House but there are a few aspects about which I think one can rightly reason with the hon. Senator Horak. The hon. Senator has shown an attitude of reasonableness today. He has endeavoured to argue the merits of the situation and I want to respond to him in the same manner.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, does the hon. Senator Horak accept that the degree of sovereignty which we enjoy&#x2014;White, Coloured and Indian South Africa&#x2014;is dependent upon the degree of sovereignty which we grant to others? Does he in fact place an embargo on our own sovereignty by refusing to accord other nations in the Southern Africa complex their sovereignty? One cannot have it both ways, Sir. The hon. Senator Horak will be the first to say: Yes, we would like to enjoy a sovereignty that will ensure the continuation and the maintenance of our own culture and our own traditions. But at the same time he will qualify this by requiring that other nations be denied their sovereignty. Let me put it this way to the hon. Senator Horak: He does not deny that Venda is a nation, that it is a nation with its own language, culture and customs. He has not denied that by virtue of its ethnicity Venda has been independent of any other nation in respect of the maintenance of those very elements of its nationhood&#x2014;its culture, its language, its customs and its traditions. Does the hon. Senator Horak consider that the withholding of sovereign independence will create a greater financial obligation towards any state, in particular Vendaland or any other people, than in any event exists by virtue of their contribution to the total gross domestic product of all the economically independent nations of Southern Africa? Does the hon. Senator not accept that the ultimate development of a people lies within the actual national virtues of the people themselves which they develop and employ in their own interests? How can the whole be greater than the summation of its individual elements? Is it not so too that greater strength can only flow out of the progress and growth of those very elements? How can the hon. Senator believe that withholding independence will promote the national character of a nation? Is the hon. Senator not able to conceive that a people who are motivated by a sense of nationhood are stronger than those who live among other peoples in an amorphous state and are gradually forced to sublimate their national culture to that of others? There are also other aspects that we could raise. Time does not permit me to do so but the element of our policy lies therein that we grant the right to other peoples to advance to sovereign independent nationhood.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, in the first instance I should like to thank hon. Senators for their congratulations on my promotion. I sincerely hope that I will be able to serve this country with devotion. Thank you.</p>
                        <p>*I think we should start with the fact that hon. Senators said that there had been development. They are pleased about that but they do not want it to go further than development in the constitutional sense of the word. In respect of the development that has taken place in Venda and the figures I have given which hon. Senators Opposite tried to belittle somewhat, I can tell you, Sir, that the African states to which reference has been made, states which are poorer and smaller than Venda with fewer people, also adjoin other states. They are dependent upon and interdependent in respect of co-operation with those states otherwise they will not be able to survive. Some of them do not have access to the sea. They are situated in the centre of Africa and there has to be co-operation otherwise those states cannot survive. It is a fact, however, that there is not a state in the world, big or small, that having acquired its freedom has of its own free will elected to revert to its previous position because it was better. There is not a state in the world that, having acquired its freedom, has relinquished it again.</p>
                        <p>What is happening here, in spite of everything hon. Senators say, is that with this Bill South Africa is unconditionally giving the Vendas the fatherland that they have been occupying now for nearly three centuries as a unit which they themselves can govern so that the entire Venda nation can live freely within their fatherland, Venda. That is what is happening here and hon. Senators cannot understand it and will not understand it. That is why there is a basic difference between us. I may also tell hon. Senators that I shall not repeat all the arguments because we know what they are and we differ basically. Therefore it is not necessary to repeat everything.</p>
                        <p>However, what is happening here is a matter of history repeating itself, as we have heard. I have been asked how Venda, as a poor nation, will be able to develop the huge asset of hers, namely, the coal deposits that have been discovered there. The hon. Senator Moll and other hon. Senators now say that South Africa is losing something valuable by making Venda independent. That once again simply illustrates the fact that they cannot get away from the idea of colonialism and imperialism that they still harbour in their heart of hearts. A hundred years ago the Transvaal which was a republic at the time&#x2014;I am talking about the year 1879, exactly a hundred years ago&#x2014;was probably less developed than Venda is today. It was poor and small. [Interjections.] Wait a minute, Sir, the South African republic was small and poor but there were riches under the ground and the powers of the world came and tried to take those riches away from it. Venda too has underground riches and she also has people who have ideals, people who are inspired by a feeling of nationalism and idealism. Just as the people of the Transvaal started to serve and develop their fatherland so must the people of Venda be given the same opportunity of putting their shoulder to the wheel and developing their country because of their love for it.</p>
                        <p>Sir, you ask where the money is to come from. As far as the Transvaal was concerned, the money came from outside. Foreign investors invested money here in South Africa to assist in developing the country. We have said all along that fortune-hunters should be discouraged from investing in South Africa. Naturally we do not want them. After all, the genuine investors who came to South Africa with good intentions helped to develop this country and many of them decided to throw in their lot with us. The point I want to make is the following: I spoke to a prominent manager of a mining house the other day. He</p>
                        <p>told me that according to an estimate he had made, only 7% of the total earnings of the gold mining industry in South Africa during the previous century, i.e. since the discovery of gold, had left South Africa and gone abroad. The rest, namely 93%, remained here because people had to be paid salaries, and power and equipment had to be paid for in order to develop the gold mines. The only money that left the country was in the form of dividends. As far as Venda is concerned that will also be the case. They too can allow people to develop those riches. The major portion will remain in Venda and will contribute to the development of that country. Only a small percentage will leave the country and in that way those riches will contribute their share. And we should not begrudge them that. So one must not say that South Africa is losing something. The coal deposits in Venda have never belonged to South Africa because that region has always belonged to the Venda. We should not try to deprive those people of their heritage.

                        <p>The hon. Senator Du Toit asked me to keep up the reputation of the Western Transvaal. I undertake to do so and he should also do so because I think all he had had to do lately has been to keep up the reputation of the Western Transvaal. I gained the impression that he was still dreaming of the olden days when he still had a party. The hon. Senator said he did not believe that the majority of the people of Venda wanted to become independent He does not believe that.</p>

                        <p>Yes, he says so. Very well, we understand one another. There was an election in Venda last year. Two parties took part, the ruling National Party of Captain Mpepho and the opposition party, the Venda Independent Party. Bote those parties are in favour of independence. After the election a legislative assembly was constituted and that legislative assembly decided that Venda should become independent. The Cabinet. &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>Yes, a constituted legislative assembly. The opposition gained the majority of seats in the election and the majority of the chiefs supported the ruling party. Consequently it had a majority in the legislative assembly. But they asked for independence and the legislative assembly appointed a recess committee to draft a constitution for Venda on which representatives of the ruling party and the opposition party served. The opposition party was represented on that committee and after certain amendments had been effected&#x2014;the opposition party suggested certain amendments, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, who could become president and who not and how vacancies in the future parliament should be filled&#x2014;a constitution was unanimously approved and submitted to the legislative assembly.

                        <p>No, their function was to draw up a constitution for Venda and they submitted a constitution which they had unanimously approved. Both the opposition and the government accepted the constitution. The legislative assembly of Venda consists of representatives of the opposition and the government as well as representatives from outside. Nine members of the legislative assembly of Venda live outside Venda, among others the leader of the opposition who lives in Soweto. The representatives in the legislative assembly adopted the constitution unanimously. The hon. Senator says the people of Venda do not want independence but he is totally wrong. The people of Venda have clearly and unequivocally indicated at an election and on other occasions that they want to become independent. There is not the least doubt about that.</p>
                        <p>As we all know, Venda is the third state in South Africa to become independent and consequently, when the Venda people went to the polls on that issue, they knew what it was all about; it was not a new concept to them. Hon. Senators cannot say that the Venda people did not know what the election was all about. The Venda people know that Bophuthatswana and Transkei have become independent and surely they talk to those people. The fact that those two states became independent rather inspired the Vendas to opt for their independence as well.</p>
                        <p>Hon. Senators have asked whether South Africa is better off because of the step she is taking now and because of those taken in the past. They say that the onslaughts from outside directed at South Africa have not abated. Mr. President, I admit immediately that the onslaughts against South Africa have not abated because South Africa still has her riches; South Africa is still of strategic value because the Cape sea route is still there. The Marxist world is anxious to lay its hands on these riches and to control our strategic position. So we did not expect those onslaughts to ease off. But we will be in a much stronger position to ward off those onslaughts because of this Bill and the step we envisage taking, namely, to grant the Venda people their sovereignty. They can now exercise self-determination to its fullest extent within their own fatherland just as we and other independent states are able to do in our own fatherlands. Now all the nations of Southern Africa jointly can defend their respective fatherlands against such onslaughts and in that sense we are in fact in a much better position than we would have been as a unitary state as hon. Senators want us to be. In such a case we would have a position similar to that of Angola where three different nations live in one country and fight against one another. In such a conflict situation they create an opportunity for the Marxists and the communists to gain power and to rob those nations of everything they have. That is why I say that we are now in an infinitely better position than we would have been otherwise, and there should be no doubt about that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, we have a beautiful combination in Venda. Dedicated people serve in the government. They are people who are serving their nation. The people of Venda are imbued with idealism for their fatherland Venda. When one travels through Venda today, one notices the wonderful development that has been taking place there over the past few years. Afforestation has been extended; for example, one sawmill is already operating and a second one will go into operation towards the end of this month. There are factories where black poles are produced; there are food canning factories where, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, mangoes which are grown in Venda are canned. They are also concen trating on maize and wheat farming and have flourishing fishing and tourist industries. In the industrial field, for example, 16 Black industrialists have settled there over the past few years. Tripartite companies have been established doing building work and so forth. Mr. President, Venda is already a vital state.
                        </p>
                        <p>What is happening there and in the other independent states of South Africa is a repetition of European history. Under the Roman Empire Europe was one big state. Strife, clashes and conflict among the various nations eventually developed, however, and when the various nations eventually became conscious of their own nationhood, that continent was divided and each nation established itself in its own country. There were still clashes after that but they became fewer and fewer until the European Community was established later. It was only after division had taken place that there was real co-operation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I believe that this is a vital clause. It takes away the citizenship rights of the people of Venda. It is a matter which has been discussed on previous occasions under previous legislation. I do not intend to belabour the issue but I would like to point out that two prominent South African politicians, namely, the Minister of Co-operation and Development and the hon. member for Pinetown in the Other Place, have both stated overseas that what South Africa is doing is to protect the citizenship rights of all its peoples. This clause runs contrary to the statements they are making in the United States of America. To show my objection to the clause I am going to call for a division.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I am deeply impressed by the calm atmosphere in which this Bill has been discussed in this Senate, and I was impressed also by the sincerity and the obvious concern displayed by members on the Government benches and on these benches with regard to this whole problem. I think it would be correct to say that only time will show who is right in this matter. There is no bitter difference here because this is a great and tremendous problem and the whole question is a very grave and important question. As I say, I think only time will show who was right in these debates, and we shall have to leave the matter in the lap of time.</p>
                        <p>I shall not go further than that. I could make a Third Reading speech and I could reply to some of the very good questions the hon. Senator O&#x2019;Connell asked me. I have the replies to those questions. I could also go into an economic dissertation upon whether the coal will be of more value to Venda as part of the Republic or as a separate state. I could talk about the process of decolonization in the rest of Africa and express the hope that this decolonization here will not have similar results. I do not think it will, fortunately. But I shall not do that I shall simply say that we will leave it in the lap of history. We will, of course, on our side oppose the Third Reading.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator said that we might just as well leave it to posterity to judge, and all I want to do in this Third Reading debate is to read something from the annals of history. On 22 May 1917 the leader of the former United Party and the old South African Party, Gen. Smuts, made a speech in the Savoy Hotel in London. He concluded his speech with the following words&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">It has now become an accepted axiom in our dealings with Natives that it is dishonourable to mix White and Black blood. Instead of mixing up Black and White in the old haphazard way which instead of lifting up the Blacks degraded the Whites, we are now trying to keep them apart and in that way laying down a general policy which it may take a hundred years to work out, but which in the end may be the solution to our Native problem. Thus in South Africa you will have in the long run large areas cultivated by Blacks and governed by Blacks, where they will look after themselves in all forms of living and development, whilst in the rest of the country you will have your White communities which will govern themselves separately according to the accepted European principles.</block>
                        <p>That is the policy of the NP which it is now putting into practice.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, of course, everybody interested in politics knows that particular statement very well, but I did not know that the NP set so much store by what Gen. Smuts used to say. But I am interested in the Nationalist Party of 1979, and if one looks at what the Nationalist Party of 1979 is saying, it is a completely different thing. The Minister of Foreign Affairs says he is not prepared to lay down his life for apartheid while other Ministers are saying other things. As I said just now &#x2026; [Interjections.] Dr. Koornhof said in America: &#x201C;I believe in the right of every man to equality before the law, to full citizenship.&#x201D; This is also the Nationalist Party in 1979! [Interjections.] It is a completely different thing. He said that South Africa had entered a period in which all races were becoming involved in the decision-making. [Interjections .] In decision-making, not in the decision-making of separate states but in the decision-making of South Africa itself. This is what Dr. Koornhof said. [Interjections.] I can read what Dr. Koornhof said and other hon. Senators opposite can do so too, but they most probably read what Dr. Treurnicht said this morning in repudiating Dr. Koornhof. We have a little war going on inside the Nationalist Party caucus. [Interjections.] That is happening right at this very minute. Mr. President, what Gen. Smuts said was fine for 1917 but the Nationalist Party are saying in 1979 they do not even agree with each other. [Interjections.] So to my mind this is all a lot of nonsense.</p>
                        <p>I want to say, as I said earlier on in my Second Reading speech, that the Nationalist Party has adopted a hands-up policy. There is no question about it. They cannot hope to rule South Africa as a White race so they will split it up and they will end up in some little corner, tucked away somewhere, and say: &#x201C;Look we are a White government ruling White people.&#x201D; The rest of South Africa will have been hived off. It will be under attack by every foreign ideology in the world, Cubans, Communists, the whole lot, and we will be trying to defend it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I do not intend to become involved in a long debate at this late stage.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I just want to place one further thought on record, and it is this: I know that there are difficulties in the administration and control of a Parliament as big as this one. I know that certain things have to take their turn. But I want to place on record my objection and my very sincere protest to you, Sir, as President of this House, that in tee past two weeks in particular we have had some of the most important legislation of the whole session to consider. In the early days of the session the legislation which came before us was non-controversial and we were able to spend a good deal of time debating it. I think it is a tragedy, and I do not think it is good parliamentary practice or good for South Africa, that we should have to debate such important pieces of legislation such as the Bill before us now at this late stage. I am quite certain there are members on the other side of the House who would also have liked to speak. We are fortunate in the Opposition in that our numbers are small and most of us get an opportunity to speak&#x2014;probably too often! But I know that there are members on that side of the House who have valuable contributions to make; whose views, though I may disagree with them, I respect; and I would have liked to hear some of those views. But, Mr. President, the mechanics of Parliament, the way in which we are handling legislation does not augur well for the democratic and the parliamentary system. I would appeal to the powers that be to let us at least have the important legislation early in the session when we can do it justice. I am not speaking only for myself because I know there are members on the other side who have good and valuable contributions to make to debates on legislation like this. We have dealt with a Bill this morning which gives sovereign independence, a high status, to the Vendas. It is a matter of grave and great importance and we have divergent views on it But it has gone through this Chamber&#x2014;I shall not say in record time&#x2014;very quickly. It has been debated and certain people have taken part in the debate but I believe it could have been discussed in far greater depth than it was. People could have made bigger and better contributions. I think it is wrong that we should deal with legislation of this importance with this speed. I do not think we do justice to this House, to ourselves and to the system of Government in South Africa. I just felt that I had to place that on record and I hope in future the Government will try to avoid introducing important legislation at the end of a session.</p>

                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>The turmoil surrounding the former Department of Information has for a considerable time now been the subject of intensive investigations and debates in this House and elsewhere. The matter was investigated in depth by a judicial commission of inquiry and the persons who had been involved and implicated in it were identified. My feeling is that it is a heartfelt desire on the part of all responsible hon. members of this House that we and our people should again be able to concentrate our energy and strength fully on the great challenges and problems which our country has to contend with.</p>
                        <p>When I say this, Mr. President, I do not mean that we should forget the lessons to be learned from this episode, or that the law should not be allowed to take its course, or that the final salvage work should not be disposed of properly. This will be proceeded with. In fact, this Bill, as well as the Bill on the State Trust Board and the one relating to the office of Advocate-General, contain measures to this effect. What I mean, however, is that the shock which the disclosures caused in our national life should now be shaken off, and that in particular the episode should not be allowed to dominate the true political debate in this country and the consideration of important matters of policy any further.</p>
                        <p>In an important sense it is consequently the object of this Bill to help bring this chapter in our history to a final close. With this object in mind it is necessary, from a financial and administrative point of view, for Parliament, and therefore this House, to take two steps.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, with a view to the future, this House is being requested to authorize the creation of a special account for secret information services on the same basis on which similar accounts already exist for other secret services. In this way essential covert projects of the new Information Service of South Africa which cannot be defrayed from its ordinary Vote may in future be continued under the clear and specific sanction, directives and restrictions of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, this House is now being requested to deal with the extra-legal actions of the past and to get them finally and formally settled. In this connection this House is aware that State moneys were from time to time made available to the former Department of Information without covering Parliamentary appropriations, as required by sections 2 and 4 of the Exchequer and Audit Act read in conjunction with section 98 of the Constitution Act, having existed for that purpose. Hon. Senators will observe that the House is not being asked to appropriate these amounts retrospectively. In view of the way in which a portion of these moneys were ultimately applied, hon. Senators are not being asked to do this and in that way perhaps sanction or condone these actions by implication. The House is being asked to approve of these moneys being deemed to have been appropriated, so that this aspect of the matter may then technically be considered to have been disposed of. If this legal and financial instrument is not utilized in this way, the irregularity will technically continue to exist and it will not be possible to say that this House was finally afforded a proper opportunity to deal with and in fact dispose of the matter formally.</p>
                        <p>However, the amounts of money to which I have just referred were not only channelled to the former Department of Information without Parliamentary appropriation, but were also expended by the Department without Parliamentary authority. Similarly, as far as this second leg of the irregularities is concerned, these matters may only be finalized and disposed of by Parliament by means of appropriate statutory provisions. Here, too, hon. Senators will understand that I do not feel myself at liberty to ask the House to approve, authorize or condone the unauthorized expenditure. All I am asking this House to do, therefore, is to approve of what has been done being accepted statutorily as a 
                            <i>fait accompli</i>, so that the matter may now finally be closed.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Bill therefore provides that expenditure incurred by the former Department of Information from its secret funds shall finally constitute a charge against such funds, which shall also be deemed to have been appropriated. I repeat: This measure should not be seen as condoning, authorizing or assenting to what happened. It is merely an instrument by means of which Parliament has to deal technically with the matter in order to get it out of our system.</p>
                        <p>Naturally it is not the intention of the Government to exonerate persons who harmed the State through their actions and misdeeds from any criminal or civil liability. On the contrary. The Bill makes specific provision for that. The law must take its course, and the Government has for a long time now been doing everything in its power to safeguard the financial interests of the State and to recover all amounts and recoupments to which it is legally entitled. This process will continue.</p>
                        <p>The House is aware that the Government has, since 1 July 1978, being salvaging the affairs of the former Department of Information. Covering statutory recognition is now being given in the Bill to the steps that have been taken in this connection, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, in respect of settlements that have been negotiated and assets and rights that have been secured. In addition provision is being made for the further ratification of contracts which may be necessary on the recommendation of the State Trust Board.
                        </p>
                        <p>As far as the progress being made with the clearing up of the projects of the former Department of Information is concerned, I can inform this House that the latest information which I have at my disposal&#x2014;as at 15 June&#x2014;indicates that just over R29,1 million has been recovered or is recoverable. Apart from this amount there are also various properties that are registered in the name of the State. Of the amount of R29,1 million, however, an amount of R4 898 074 had to be employed in the interim for the operation of certain projects.</p>

                        <from>Senator

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, right at the outset I want to move the following amendment to the motion for the Second Reading of the Information Service of South Africa Special Account Bill, namely&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister and the House will realize, Sir, that this form of amendment is the strongest form of protest possible against any Bill. I intend motivating this amendment later but let me say first of all that we have no objection at this stage to the first five clauses of the Bill which provide for the establishment of an account, while afterwards it is provided that the account be credited with certain moneys from certain sources. It also vests responsibility and accountability in the new Director-General. We therefore have no objection to the first five clauses which deal mainly with administrative matters and the establishment of this account. But as far as clauses 6 and 7 are concerned, they are totally unacceptable to us.</p>
                        <p>*I heard an hon. Senator say: &#x201C;And that coming from you.&#x201D; I want to say to the Senate and to hon. gentlemen who are members of this Upper House that it is not only the Opposition that has a duty in this House but hon. Senators opposite as well. One of our duties is to see to it that money obtained by way of taxation is correctly spent and that authority is not granted for irregularities to take place by way of legislation. I think this is one of our most important duties.</p>
                        <p>One cannot use legislation to clean something that is dirty. One can amend it by way of a majority in a council chamber as in this case, but no one can tell me that something which is dirty, as this matter is, and which was revealed to us and made public by all three reports of the Erasmus Commission, can be laundered by legalizing it through the passing of legislation through both Houses of Parliament.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>If the hon. Senator really thinks that the legalization of these payments and their transfers by way of a clause in a Bill undoes the matter, he still has a great deal to learn about how one rectifies something that is wrong in public life.</p>
                        <p>I do not want to spend much time on this Bill because we are at a stage of the session at which time is an important factor. Nevertheless I think that when we are dealing with important legislation such as this, one has to deal with it as thoroughly as possible in the shortest possible time so that the greatest number of details may be examined. Consequently I want to deal at once with clause 6.</p>
                        <p>As far as clause 6 is concerned I want to make a few remarks with reference to what the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech. The idea is repeatedly put to us that the House is not being asked to vote these amounts retrospectively, and &#x201C;the House is being asked to give its approval to these moneys being regarded as voted&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister is only asking us to approve the fact that these moneys be deemed to have been voted. Why should we be confronted at this stage with this kind of request, viz. to give approval to these moneys being deemed to have been voted? Sir, legal provision has been made for the transfer of these moneys. Does the hon. the Minister now want to tell me that in consequence of the sentence he has quoted here, viz.&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">&#x2026; the House is being asked to approve of these moneys being deemed to have been appropriated &#x2026;</block>
                        <p>that these moneys have not been voted, Sir, through the channels described by the Act? I should like the hon. the Minister to listen to my question.</p>

                        <p>To me this is very important; it was emphasized in this Second Reading speech. Then the following is said&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>I do not know whether this hon. Senator is in a position to reply by saying &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I am putting the question to the hon. the Minister, and the hon. the Minister is sitting and smiling very sweetly like a boy who has done something wrong and is now sorry about it. He states very clearly here&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">&#x2026; this aspect of the cases may then technically be considered to have been disposed of.</block>
                        <p>If he told me that this is his only aim with this legislation, then I want to ask him what has become of all the channels created previously which made provision for the technical settlement of matters of this nature? What about the certificates that had to be given by Ministers; the authorizations that had to be signed before certain moneys could be voted, transferred and paid? Why, then, is this provision necessary so that the matter can be regarded as being disposed of technically?</p>
                        <p>Then the hon. the Minister goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">If this legal and financial instrument is not utilized in this way, the irregularity will technically continue to exist &#x2026;</block>

                        <p>&#x2026; and it will not be possible to say that this House was finally afforded a proper opportunity to deal with and in fact dispose of the matter formally.</p>
                        <p>I now want to say to the hon. the Minister</p>
                        <p>that it is the considered opinion of this side of the hon. Senate that by dealing with these matters technically we are not disposing of them formally or morally. That we are not doing. The hon. the Minister goes on to say&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Similarly, as far as this second leg of the irregularities is concerned, these matters may only be finalized and disposed of by Parliament by means of appropriate statutory provisions.</block>
                        <p>Then the final one&#x2014;</p>

                        </block>
                        <p>I think that is wishful thinking, Sir. No one will believe that by legalizing these irregularities in a Bill of this nature, the matter will be finally disposed of and can be finally brought to a conclusion. That is not what will happen. Because, Sir, what are we legalizing? When one looks at the transfers that have taken place here, one need only look at the three reports of the Erasmus Commission to understand and to read in those reports what irregularities took place there, not only irregularities committed by people who are being criminally charged but irregularities that occurred here in the proceedings and the workings of Parliament and the Executive of South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Defence must have realized that such irregularities existed, because in the first report of the Erasmus Commission, reference is made to a letter by Gen. Magnus Malan to the then Secretary for Information, Dr. Rhoodie, in which he was told that apart from the moral aspect of the matter, he would also have felt that way about the matter if his Minister had to stand up and tell untruths in a budget debate in order to obtain additional funds. Those were the kind of transfers that took place, because you must remember, Sir, that the greater part of these transfers came from the Special Account of the Department of Defence.</p>

                        <p>Any story can have a beard, but it can still be true. The truth thereof need not be disputed. The fact that it has a beard and the fact that it is true will not be undone by legislation of this nature, particularly clause 6 that seeks to legalize transfers. I cannot see this, and I want to know how, under these circumstances, one can justify and dispose of irregularities by legalizing them, irregularities of which the hon. the Prime Minister was aware by implication, because that is more or less what the hon. the Minister of Finance said.</p>
                        <p>What did the hon. the Minister of Finance say in his evidence? He admits to a lack of knowledge of the type of projects for which he authorized payments. [Interjections.] Sir, I do not know what the circumstances were. I have not yet seen all the evidence. I should be much obliged if the hon. the Deputy Minister were to give me the evidence so that I, too, could judge. [Interjections.] I am not in the House of Assembly; I am in this hon. Higher House of Parliament.</p>

                        <p>The hon. gentleman who is today making his début in this hon. Higher House of Parliament in his new capacity as Deputy Minister of Finance should really not come to this hon. Higher House with such weak arguments if he hopes to make any progress. Let us look at the newspaper reports, Sir. It occurred this morning in this Higher House that hon. Senators of the Opposition quoted newspaper reports of what Ministers said. And what did members on the Government side say? They asked: Can one believe those newspapers? And they added: Do not believe them. And here the hon. the Deputy Minister says we can read newspapers. Of course we can read newspapers. But I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister: If he attaches such great value to what is said in newspapers, has he believed all reports that have appeared in the Press recently concerning this issue that we are now trying to dispose of finally, viz. the Information scandal? Has he taken those reports to heart? [Interjections.] I shall welcome the hon. the Deputy Minister to this House on a later occasion, but I think he has just welcomed himself. As was said in the boxing-ring in the old days, he forgot to cover up and walked into a straight right. The trouble is that he walked into his own straight right. That is the point; he saw himself in the mirror. I should like to repeat: The hon. Deputy Minister did one good thing by way of this interjection of his and that was to draw attention away from the hon. Minister of Finance. If that was his aim, he succeeded and I want to congratulate him.</p>
                        <p>I repeat that implicit in the approvals being granted here, is the recognized lack of knowledge of the type of projects for which the hon. the Minister of Finance granted the authorizations in question, authorizations by way of which these transfers occurred and by way of which certain projects were financed.</p>

                        <p>What does the hon. the Minister envisage authorizing technically so that this affair can be worked out of our system? I do not know what the hon.

We probably have to guess what this &#x201C;it&#x201D; refers to, viz. that it refers to the Information scandal. However, let us look at what the hon. the Minister wants to do. He can now do the following&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>This includes many things. It includes, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, the sale of 
                            <i>The Citizen.</i> To ask me, as a member of the Opposition, to agree to these clauses and vote for them just because it is necessary technically, is not to me an adequate reason why I should support this Bill. I still want to know in what way 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> was disposed of. After millions of rands of the taxpayers&#x2019; money had been spent to have that newspaper established and founded, it was sold for a ridiculously small amount in comparison with the amount spent on it. To whom was it disposed of? To Perskor. Good National Party people are directors of that newspaper. We on this side of the House cannot approve of such behaviour.

However, I am convinced that it will be pointless. This scandal does not attach to a certain party only. I am part of the people of South Africa, and the Government of the day is my Government too. Therefore that scandal attaches to me, too, as a citizen of this country. If there is anyone in this House who thinks that by accepting this technical clause in this Bill we shall clear the name of South Africa of this scandal, then he is making the biggest mistake he has ever made in his life.</p>

This reminded me of the time when I attended a meeting at which the question of the misuse of money under the previous United Party government was raised. It was the South African Party at the time. The late Minister Reitz was also present at that meeting. Someone in the audience got up and started to ask questions more or less along the same lines as those which the hon. Senator Swanepoel has just asked. He kept on asking questions. Then the late Minister Reitz said to him: &#x201C;My friend, let us get on with our work; there is work to be done; bring all your newspaper cuttings; bring everything you have collected; I notice you have a whole handful of them; I shall certify them as being correct and then we can carry on with our work.&#x201D; That is the position today in connection with this legislation. This legislation is an admission that money has been misused. It is an admission that offences have been committed.</p>

                        <p>The hon. the Deputy Minister expressed doubt about it a moment ago.</p>
                    </speech>
                    <speech by="#rensburg">
                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">D. G. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>The Government have said that they accept the reports. Surely that is an admission. That has been certified. Nobody argues about that. We have now reached a stage where we say: Look, there have been irregularities; we are not going to argue any further and ask for this or that to be proved. We accept all that. We are now entering a new era and continuing as before. The hon. Senator Swanepoel took serious exception to certain things the hon. the Minister allegedly said. The Government said that it would expose everything.</p>
                        <p>The Government went further as did the commission. The Government said: &#x201C;Come and give evidence before the commission; we invite you and we are anxious to get that evidence; the evidence you can give will assist us in exposing the whole matter and finalizing it.&#x201D; And now, irrespective of the harm it is doing to the country, the hon. Senator Swanepoel refuses to leave the matter at that and to accept what the Government is doing in this connection. The Government says it accepts the position but we are entering a new era. The hon. Senator Swanepoel raised three points. If my memory serves me correctly, he said that he resented the fact that the hon. the Minister had said and as the Bill also stated that that was considered to be the position. Mr. President that is a term that is often used in the legal world. A position is accepted up to a certain stage. In other words, all the hon. the Minister says and submits by way of this legislation is that we are accepting the position up to this stage. We accept the reports of the two commissions. We accept that there has been a misappropriation of money and that there has been fraud in certain respects. We also accept that there has been theft in certain cases. However, we are not argueing about that at the moment, Sir. We are reacting by means of legislation and are trying to clear up the financial aspects of the matter.</p>
                        <p>When I studied this legislation for the first time, Sir, it reminded me of an insolvent estate. It sometimes happens that a prominent company is liquidated or, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, a prominent person is sequestrated. In such a case a curator is appointed and in this respect the trust board that is being appointed here is synonymous with the appointment of a curator. The curator does not waste time arguing about money or assets that have been misappropriated. He accepts the position as it is at the moment and declares the estate insolvent. That is what is being done here, Sir. The procedure to be followed is laid down in various laws. We accept the situation and we are, in other words, in the process of liquidating the estate. In what other way does tee hon. Senator Swanepoel want the estate to be liquidated? Does he want us to argue for days, months and years on end about matters on which the Pretorius and the Erasmus Commissions have already issued their findings? Does be want us to argue about every small amount and ascertain in what respect this R5 or R100 or R300 has been misappropriated? Surely that is not our job.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. President, we all regret what has happened in connection with the Department of Information. The Prime Minister and various members of the Cabinet have said repeatedly that the Government deeply regretted what had happened but that steps had now to be taken to clear up the matter.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore the hon. Senator Swanepoel resented another remark made by the hon. the Minister to the effect that the matter would be rectified technically. In other words, one cannot argue against facts and neither does one argue against them. We are not at this stage arguing about some fact or other because we have already done so. The Government appointed commissions and their reports were accepted. The matter has now to be rectified technically and that is what the Bill before us envisages. The misdeed must be put right technically. In terms of the Bill, 1 July 1978 is the date after which all expenditure on behalf of the State is to be validated.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel also resents tee idea that the matter should be rectified from a legal point of view. Mr. President, in doing that it is not being suggested for one moment that because the matter is being rectified by means of legislation the Government has accepted that everything was handled correctly and has condoned the actions of the officials of the Department of Information. We are now trying by means of legislation to put this matter right because there is no other way in which it can be put right. Clause 6(2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of section 8 any expenditure incurred or purporting to have been incurred for secret projects of the former Department of Information shall be deemed to be a charge against the appropriated money referred to in subsection (1),</block>
                        <p>We are not arguing about that Sir. We accept that something wrong has been done and in order to enable us to liquidate these liabilities we must take it that the money was voted for the department as provided for in the Bill. Surely it is not difficult to understand that. In terms of this subsection the money that has been incorrectly spent &#x201C;shall be deemed to be a charge against the appropriated money referred to in subsection (1)&#x201D;. Once again this is no condonation of moneys misappropriated but in order to finalize the estate it is accepted that the money was voted for the department. We are not arguing at this stage that the money was not originally appropriated. For the purposes of the Bill we take it that it was appropriated and we stipulate a date, namely 1 July 1978 and go on from there.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel does not approve of the following passage in clause 7 either&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">&#x2026; if he deems fit ratify any contract concluded or purporting to have been concluded by or on behalf of the former Department of Information which on account of the absence of authority for its conclusion does not bind the State.</block>
                        <p>Contracts that have been entered into are being investigated but if the Government has to bicker and argue over every contract and weigh up one claim against another, where will that get us? In terms of this legislation the Government accepts that people have acted incorrectly. The Government says it is ratifying contracts that have been entered into by those people. If we do not ratify those contracts we shall have to go into the question of whether or not those people were authorized to enter into those contracts. We shall have to determine whether or not they were empowered to take certain steps. And if we find that they did not have the power what are we to do then? Then the whole matter will be in limbo. That is why the legislation provides for contracts entered into by the former Department of Information or purported to have been entered into be ratified. Those words &#x201C;purported to have been entered into&#x2019; &#x2019; are important, Sir.</p>
                        <p>I take it that Eschel Rhoodie said on occasion that he was acting on behalf of the Government. The legislation now says &#x201C;purported to have been entered into&#x201D;. If we did not do that, where would we be? What hope would we have of ever finalizing this matter? What hope would we have of ever clearing up this matter if we did not take these steps?</p>
                        <p>Reference is made in the legislation to the date 1 July 1978. From that date certain settlements will have been negotiated and the Government will have done everything in its power to rectify this precarious position as it possibly could. Clause 7(1)(b) reads&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law but subject to the provisions of section 8&#x2014;
                            <br/>(b) any settlement negotiated by or on behalf of the State on or after 1 July 1978 in respect of any contract concluded or purporting to have been concluded by the said former Department is hereby validated.
                        </block>
                        <p>Once again this is only to have a starting point from which action can be taken. However, what follows is important and the hon. Senator Swanepoel did not refer to this because I do not think it suited his argument to do so. Clause 8 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">The provisions of sections 6 and 7 shall not exempt any person from any liability towards the State or to be prosecuted for any offence.</block>
                        <p>The position is accepted up to this stage for the purposes of liquidating the estate and rectifying what has been wrong but the people who were responsible for the position are not being exonerated.</p>

                        <p>Irregular? Mention one country which does not have a secret fund and where certain things are not done in secret. The hon. Senator Swanepoel has said that he accepts clauses I to 5 unequivocally but clause 2(2) provides that money can be utilized &#x201C;with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance . . on such services deemed by the Minister concerned &#x201C; &#x2026; as being in the national interest and which because of the secret or sensitive nature thereof cannot be defrayed from the vote of the Information Service of South Africa for the purpose of (a) promoting the image of, and a positive disposition towards the Republic; and (b) averting the psychological attacks on the Republic. The hon. Senator Swanepoel did not object to that clause because he knew that that was the position in the rest of the world as well. No country tells the world what it does with certain of its funds. The purpose of this fund is, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, &#x201C; &#x2026; averting the psychological attacks on the Republic&#x201D;. Surely the steps taken towards this end cannot be broadcast throughout the world. Surely that has been the position in the past as well. Surely the underlying idea of any secret fund is to prevent any harm being done to the country concerned. The hon. Senator Swanepoel said that he approved of that. This is a state of affairs that has always obtained but unfortunately certain people have misappropriated these funds.

                        <p>I have already dealt with clauses 6 and 7. One reaches a certain stage where circumstances compel one to accept things as they are. In this respect I have compared the position with that of a company which has been placed in liquidation and an estate that has been sequestrated. The curator takes the matter to a certain stage. He ascertains what the assets and liabilities are and everything that has happened up to that stage. He knows that what has happened is no concern of his; he only knows that he must clear up the matter as best he can. He must try to do the best he can for the creditors involved in the estate. In this case the curator is the State Trust Board and the board will have to determine what can be done that will be in the best interests of the creditors. I, the hon. Senator Swanepoel and every taxpayer in this country are creditors in this case. We want everything saved that can be saved.</p>
                        <p>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity of congratulating the hon. the Minister and his officials, especially the legal draftsmen, and to thank them sincerely for this legislation which deals with such an important matter. They have analysed the entire matter and condensed it into a few clauses. This is the first occasion in our history that a Bill of this nature has been submitted to us. Once again I want to emphasize that we have it before us only after it has been admitted that a mistake has been made.</p>
                        <p>If I may be allowed to use a figure of speech, Sir, I want to ask that we as citizens of South Africa should now bury the Information affair. It is no use fighting with a corpse. We are on our way back from the funeral to the house where refreshments are to be served. We only want to do the best we possibly can in future. We are sorry if there are people who have suffered loss in the process. If there are people who have done anything wrong, the law will deal with them. Let us say now, not only in the interests of the Opposition but in the interests of the whole of South Africa that the funeral is over and that we shall do the best we possibly can in future. Let us finalize the liquidation of the estate and find out what the highest dividends are that we can pay to the creditors. Every citizen of this country is a creditor or client in this case. I wish the hon. the Minister and the State Trust Board all the success in the world in doing the best they possibly can for South Africa by way of this legislation. Let us forget as far as possible what has happened and face the future with confidence so that we can try to achieve what is in the best interests of this beautiful country of ours, South Africa.</p>

                        <p>That is not provided for in this legislation and that is where the confusion starts. I do not think that even the hon. the Minister of Finance can guarantee that certain people who have been guilty of a wrongdoing in terms of the legislation can still be prosecuted after this Bill has been passed with retrospective effect because its retrospective effect will make certain of these actions legal. But let us agree to disagree on that particular point. The hon. Senator Van Rensburg said some other things with which I want to deal with immediately.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Van Rensburg said that the Government was not pleased with what had happened and that it was unhappy about this whole incident. The hon. Chief Whip nods his head, but they have not demonstrated that they are overly concerned about this. If they were overly concerned about the incidents that took place why did they allow 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> to slip out of the hands of the public of South Africa who had paid for this newspaper? How can the hon. Senator Van Rensburg tell me that the Government and the Nationalist Party were unhappy with events and yet they allowed 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> to be disposed of in the manner in which it was?

                        <p>I certainly am not, are you? Are the people of South Africa satisfied? [Interjections.] The Government showed complete contempt for tee people of South Africa by the manner in which it allowed 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> to be sold to Perskor. The hon. Senator must know that. The people of South Africa still mistrust the Government, no matter what it says about the Information scandal. The people of South Africa will never forgive the Government for what it did and the way it disposed of 
                            <i>The Citizen.</i> The hon. the Minister of Finance can shake his head as much as he likes; I am telling him that until that matter is cleared up satisfactorily the people of South Africa say they are being treated with contempt in regard to this matter. [Interjections.] I for one, for instance, can never accept the sincerity of the Government in regard to the Information scandal until they have assured me that they have done the best for the people of South Africa in the disposal of 
                            <i>The Citizen.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>Can the hon. the Minister tell me, for instance, how much it cost the State to meet the monthly losses incurred by 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> after it became known that it had been financed by the Department of Information? [Interjections.] Perhaps the hon. Senator who is making so much noise can tell me, because nobody else knows. It was assumed that 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> was losing R15 000 a month. This was after the scandal broke and everybody knew who was behind the formation of 
                            <i>The Citizen.</i> It continued to lose money at the rate of R150 000 a month and nobody has been able to say where that money came from.

It shows the Government&#x2019;s complete contempt for public opinion.

                        <p>No, Sir, it seems to try to push the scandal aside, to put what happened aside and push it into the background. The Government would like to see that happen. The Government prays it will happen, and Heaven knows we all hope that we can move away from the Information scandal. But this piece of legislation will perpetuate the Information scandal. It must do, because if one looks at the wording it reeks of covering up, of legalizing illegalities. And there is no other way that one can look at it. The hon. Senator Van Schoor can shake his head as much as he likes; this is what is in the printed document before us.</p>

                        <p>How can one support legislation which legalizes illegalities? That is what this is doing, and this, Sir, is why we certainly could never support this Bill. It is retrospective; it makes legal something which was illegal. The hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Defence acted improperly when they allowed money to pass from the Department of Defence to the Department of Information. They acted contrary to the law, and the hon. the Minister of Finance must be the first to admit it because his evidence to the Erasmus Commission was to the effect that he did not like it; it was something he had inherited and he had protested against it. But the hon. the Minister must admit&#x2014;he must be the first to admit&#x2014;that those actions were in fact not proper; they were illegal at the time. They were illegal in terms of our constitutional processes. He knew that the way in which he was doing those things was not the way he should have been doing them in terms of the powers entrusted to him as Minister of Finance. But he went along with it; he protested but he went along with it. The Minister of Defence knew that what was happening was wrong. He protested but he went along with it. This Bill before us now puts that matter right. It now says that their hands in that respect are clean and that no blame attaches to them. But, Mr. President, you cannot just wipe the slate clean in that manner. [Interjections.] And the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter can laugh like a hyena if he wishes, but these are the facts of the matter. You cannot just say that it was wrong a week ago or a day ago and then wave a magic wand and suddenly everything becomes pure and clean. It does not work like that, Sir, except perhaps in the Nationalist Party ranks.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>No, Sir, I am not arguing about the projects; I am not delving into the old matters of the report What I am saying is that the hon. the Minister stated in his evidence, as did the hon. the Minister of Defence, that money passed from the Department of Defence to the Department of Information. The Minister of Finance did not like it. He objected to it. It was something he had inherited. The Minister of Defence did not like it but it was something that he too had inherited, or something that he had been instructed to do. I am not talking about the projects themselves. This has been the claim of the Minister of Finance right from the beginning. I am not arguing with it one iota. But what this Bill does now is to put that matter right. It says that the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s attitude was the correct one because it validates some past wrong. Therefore, it exonerates him from any blame, any authoritative blame, and it exonerates the present Prime Minister. I do not believe that one can act in this way. I want to give hon. Senators an example of what I mean. [Interjections.]</p>
                        <p>Yes, let me give hon. Senators an example. Some two or three years ago we sent our troops into Angola and we had to pass retrospective legislation to make that legal because at the time the manner in which they were sent into Angola was illegal. It was against the South African Constitution. It had to be legalized by a Bill being passed through this House. But if we are to act in this manner in the future, it means that every time the Government commits a wrong in terms of our Constitution or in terms of the law, or if the Minister makes a mistake, it can ratify that mistake by merely bringing legislation to this House and backdating it, making it retrospective. Then suddenly it becomes pure and clean as the driven snow and everybody is happy again.</p>
                        <p>But who can tolerate such a system? What do we have laws for if we can rectify errors committed wittingly or unwittingly by the Government simply by introducing legislation and backdating it? We cannot run a country in that manner but I say we owe more than that to the public of South Africa. We are here to protect them. We pass legislation which they can study if they so wish so that they can see that this is how the law operates. This is how we are governed. This is the system of government that we have. But that will mean nothing because every time something is done by an official, by a Cabinet Minister or by the Government as a whole, which is in error, it simply rectifies that by passing retrospective legislation. That is what we are doing here this afternoon. I cannot see how hon. Senators over there can just sit back and take it so calmly, so quietly. [Interjections .] Where else does this sort of thing happen? [Interjections.] I want to say to the hon. Senator De Jager that there is nothing new to him in this at all. He accepts this method of government because he does not believe that any hon. Minister sitting on those front benches can do anything wrong. Everything they do and say is correct; he does not question what they do but I am in a different position.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Van Rensburg talked about clause 1. He said every country in the world has a secret service account. The hon. Senator Swanepoel did not deal in particular with clause 1; he concentrated on clause 6. But I object to clause 1 as well, Sir. While I accept that every country in the world has a secret service account and has to involve itself in secret service matters&#x2014;heaven help it if it did not!&#x2014;I do not believe that that is the function of a Department of Information. For a Government to run a Department of Information effectively and for it to have some force, such a Department of Information must be frank and it must be open. The moment it is not, it becomes suspect. All these secret matters in which the department got itself involved were matters that would have been better handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Experience has proved this. That is really the function of the Department of Foreign Affairs. But the trouble we got into was because we allowed the Department of Information to involve itself in secret matters in regard to which it had no expertise and no experience and as a result it made a hash of those matters. So when clause 1 allows the new Information Service to have a secret fund I say I do not agree with that at all. I believe that to be effective, the Information Service must be open and frank. In that way what it does and says will be believed. I do not believe it will be believed in any other way. Secret services should be conducted by the department that is specially trained to handle them. Experience has shown in the past that this department was not able to handle such matters and that is why it got into the mess it did.</p>
                        <p>I must certanly vote against legislation of this nature. As I said right at the beginning I believe that in retrospect it may well be found that this piece of legislation, these few clauses, may in the long term be shown to have been more damaging to South Africa than the Department of Information scandal itself. It may in the long term prove to be the greatest scandal of them all.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">Comdt. L. F. POORTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I do not think any hon. Senator on this side of the House really expected the Opposition to support this legislation. The reasons are very clear to those of us who sit here as to why they will not support this kind of Bill. I want to acknowledge that Senator Swanepoel said he would support clauses 1 to 5, which was at least an admission that there was some good in this Bill for the future. Both the Opposition parties regard clauses 6 to the end as being not supportable while the hon. Senator Winchester said that he would, in fact, not even support clause 1. Why does the Opposition not want to support this kind of Bill? The answer is very simple, Sir. In all the years of their existence, the Opposition has never had such a wonderful horse to ride as the Information scandal. If they support this Bill they realize that they will be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. They have in fact been exploiting the embarrassment of the Government in regard to the Information scandal since the day it broke. In politics one expects political parties to be able to do so, but to go on 
                            <i>ad infinitum</i> is like brooding on an egg until such time as it does not hatch but goes rotten. That is what has happened with the Information scandal. I put it to the Opposition quite squarely that this egg is no longer going to hatch to the advantage of the Opposition but that it turned rotten long ago. The results of the various elections throughout the country disprove entirely the statement made by the hon. Senator Winchester who believes that he is, shall I say, the saviour of South Africa, and that his party is the bastion between this evil Government and the people; that his party is going to protect the people of this country from this evil Government.
                        </p>
                        <p>I think the record of the hon. the Prime Minister of this country is one which one should examine if one wishes to determine what the clear intention of this Government is. Within ten minutes of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s having been elected, he stood on our Senate steps and said: &#x201C;I stand for the kind of administration which is clean.&#x201D; He made certain promises and he made certain predictions. He said that if it could be proved that one single member of his Cabinet had been involved in this Information scandal, he would resign. No person could at that stage have taken a greater weight of trust upon his shoulders than did the hon. the Prime Minister. By virtue of this legislation we on this side of the House are trying to regularize something which was irregular. We make no bones about it, Sir. The hon. Senator Van Rensburg has put the case from a legal point of view. He has put his case most admirably and I certainly cannot improve on it. He said unequivocally that something was wrong, that something was irregular and that it had to be regularized through this legislation. The legislation speaks for itself, Sir. In no way does the hon. the Minister ask any hon. Senator to associate himself with any of the things that were wrong in the past. He merely says that there have been wrongdoings and that we have to regularize them. By regularizing them by means of this legislation, we are not spending one extra cent; and if we did not pass the Bill we would not be saving one extra cent. Therefore, I cannot understand the arguments of hon. Senators opposite other than to presume that they are trying to make this little political horse that they have been riding and riding, continue galloping 
                            <i>ad infinitum.</i> That is the intention of the Opposition. We heard it on the 1.30 news. I heard that in the Other Place the hon. member for Yeoville had said exactly the same as the little dog having listened to His Master&#x2019;s Voice was saying in this House. This is the sort of repetition that we have to listen to in this House time after time. I think this is the fifth time in five months that we have had a rehash of the Information scandal. One would have expected the Opposition to have taken a more realistic view; to have looked into the future, past this Information scandal from which they have been trying to extract some political advantage for themselves. One would have expected them to do that and to recognize the problems of South Africa; to recognize what lay on the road ahead for all of us&#x2014;every single Senator irrespective of the party to which he belongs&#x2014;the road into the future along which every one of us will have to play our part.
                        </p>
                        <p>We are thinking along the lines of a new Constitution. Instead of applying its mind to that, Sir, the Opposition has for the duration of the session been applying its mind as to how best to exploit the Information scandal further. The speeches by the hon. Senator Swanepoel and the hon. Senator Winchester this afternoon have proved that they cannot see any further than that. All they are interested in is gaining a minor political advantage instead of seeing the wide horizons of what lies in store for South Africa.</p>
                        <p>I am proud to support this Bill and to wish the hon. the Minister godspeed with it. I know that by regularizing something that was irregular we are going to get away from this Information scandal and that if the Opposition do not want to forget about it they will be left behind and it will be the electorate that will be their judges not us.</p>

                    <speech by="#oelrich">
                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">H. F. B. OELRICH</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, in reply to the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat and who accused the official Opposition in this House of exploiting the Information scandal, I want to put a question to him that I put earlier on during this session: Must we of the Opposition be expected merely to sit by and project an image of weak-kneed capitulation when the public are most unhappy about a situation that needs to be cleared up clearly and distinctly? I think if he thinks very carefully about that he must realize that we are not only speaking from a political point of view but also because we are patriots in South Africa and would like to see this matter cleared up, but in the right way.</p>
                        <p>*I wanted to welcome the hon. the Deputy Minister, but he has disappeared. We shall leave the matter at that.</p>
                        <p>Let me also say that I wish to place on record my satisfaction with the speech made by my colleague, the hon. Senator Swanepoel. He hit the nail on the head. He made a very excellent speech under these special circumstances. I want to ask my hon. colleagues, on both sides of this House: Are the hon. Senators, on the opposite side in particular, proud of the history of the past year or 15 months, yes or no? Are you proud of it? [Interjections.] That is the point. That is why I have just said that we want this matter cleared up in the right way. After all, these events are a blot on the responsible national administration of South Africa, something which we as hon. Senators must surely condemn. I, in my position, condemn it in the strongest terms. How can we be expected, under these circumstances, to approve of the provisions of clauses 6 and 7, the relevant clauses in this particular debate? My hon. colleague pointed out that clauses 1 to 5 are acceptable to us, but not clauses 6 and 7. After all, one must face up to reality. It avails us nothing to rectify technically, by means of a measure of this nature, what South Africa has for the past few months been trying to conceal from its already concerned voters and simply tried to sweep under the carpet.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Van Rensburg told an anecdote here about a very good acquaintance of mine, the former Minister Deneys Reitz. &#x201C;Bring your cuttings and I shall sign them so that we can carry on with our work.&#x201D; That is what Minister Reitz was supposed to have said, according to that hon. Senator. The Deputy Minister, who unfortunately is not present here at the moment, asked just prior to the speech of the hon. Senator by way of an interjection whether we on this side of the House relied on newspaper reports. Now the appeal of the hon. Senator Van Rensburg puts me in mind of the young rugby team which, as soon as things were going badly for them, suddenly wanted to change the rules. I have not been in politics for a short while only. I have been a politician for many years. I think it has been 40 to 45 years and perhaps even longer. And in all those years I was not aware of the Nationalist Party, as we know it today and when it was in Opposition, ever being in favour, then or now, of making concessions on any particular point in respect of which they would have been able to gain an unfair advantage for themselves. It all comes back to the point which the hon. Senator Poorter made, and that is politics.</p>
                        <p>We have heard the word &#x201C;irregular&#x201D; used frequently from both sides of this House. Where in the world are secret funds not made available? That was the question which the hon. Senator Van Rensburg put to us. The important link here is the reliability of the officials who carry out these instructions in conjunction&#x2014;and I want to emphasize this&#x2014; with the Minister of that department, and possibly, too, other Ministers who bear the responsibility for what has been done. I am convinced that the arguments which my colleague, the hon. Senator Swanepoel, advanced, in opposing this Bill to the utmost, are the correct attitude and we shall vote against this Bill.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I want to commence by replying immediately to the question directed by the hon. Senator Oelrich to the Government supporters, namely whether we are proud of what has happened over the past year. I have said this before and I want to emphasize it with all the power at my command: We are not proud of it. We are ashamed of what happened and what was wrong. As ashamed as we are of what happened and what was wrong, so are we in deadly earnest in moving away from this evil-smelling rubbish heap. We do not want to spend any more time on it. However, I gained the impression today that during all the years that I have been in this House the Hon. Senator Swanepoel has never before been as melodramatic as he was today. And do you know why, Mr. President? I gained the impression that the hon. Senator enjoyed walking past something that gave off an unpleasant odour. That was the impression that I gained. He enjoys that odour.</p>

                        <p>I shall be pleased if by means of this legislation we can get away from this subject, whether it be technically, legally or statutorily.

                        <p>The hon. Senator Winchester said that it was not right to expect the Opposition to condone something that was wrong. I want to tell the hon. Senator Winchester that as far as I know it is common practice in Parliament and in provincial councils to approve of unauthorized expenditure at a later date. There is a Select Committee for that purpose. They consider numbers of such cases every year and it is immaterial whether the amounts involved are big or small. That is done every year. That is standard practice. For that reason I cannot be enthusiastic enough today in supporting this legislation. Let us in a technical way finalize those things that were not right once and for all. Let us shake their dust off our shoes, take a fresh look at the future and get our priorities right.</p>

                    <speech by="#minister-of-finance">
                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, we envisage three principal objects with this Bill. In the first place we want to make provision for the establishment of a secret account for Information. I think this is very essential. All of us think so, after having evaluated this matter very thoroughly for months. We obtained very good advice on these matters. We also caused an investigation to be instituted into what is happening abroad in well-known Western countries, and there is nothing at all unusual in that connection. It is felt that this is the correct approach. Consequently that is what we want to make possible here.</p>
                        <p>Secondly there are the financial procedures concerning the transference of funds from one department to another. Since certain transactions have occurred in recent years in the context in which we have discussed them here, we should now like to state that these are deemed to have been appropriated. That transfer of funds is deemed to have been appropriated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want to ask the Opposition at once what else we should do if we do not do this? Is this not the action of an honest Government which does not want to conceal anything in this connection, but wants to tell the people: This is what happened, and we are now rectifying the matter formally. The hon. Senator Swanepoel objects to the use of the word &#x201C;technical&#x201D;, but that is the absolutely correct word. What is this if it is not a technical rectification of the financial procedures that were adopted?</p>
                        <p>There are more than three important aspects which are relevant here, but as far as I am concerned, these are the three crucial matters. For a long time now the salvage work has been in progress here. Shortly after his appointment our present Prime Minister took the initiative of immediately appointing the Pretorius Committee under the chairmanship of the former Secretary to the Treasury, one of our most senior and most experienced officials in the entire Public Service. The terms of reference of this committee were, in the first place, to make a thorough study of the secret projects, as they are called, of the former Department of Information. The committee had to make a thorough evaluation and establish whether all those projects were undesirable and consequently had to be stopped, or whether there were projects which were positive and which were in the national interests. The Pretorius Committee found, after a very thorough investigation, that a large number of those projects were well-founded, were positive, and that there was nothing wrong with them. The committee recommended without any reservations that those projects should be continued. In other words, the amount of R64 million which was mentioned in the Erasmus Commission report as the relevant amount in the secret activities of the former Department of Information&#x2014;to put it like that&#x2014;had not suddenly all been lost. It had not all been wasted. Not at all.</p>

                    <speech by="#swanepoel">

                        </from>
                        <p>And the R30 million for 
                            <i>The Citizen</i>?
                        </p>

                    <speech by="#minister">
                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>This authoritative committee recommended that a large number of these secret projects should be continued. The Government went into this recommendation very thoroughly and adopted certain resolutions in that connection. That is one of the reasons why we wish to move formally today that we must have an official secret account for Information. For if these are delicate projects that have to be kept secret, how can that money then be paid into the ordinary account of the Information Department and expended from that account? If we were to do this, the project would in no way be secret, delicate or sensitive. And we are not the only country which has such an account either; in fact, it is normal practice in the Western World. I am referring only to the Western world now, Sir, because I do not know what is happening in the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>This Bill therefore makes provision for salvage work in order to safeguard as far as possible the assets of the State involved and to recover any cash which is in jeopardy. If certain expenditure is involved in this process, i.e. if the Pretorius Committee or the body which has just been established, the State Trust Board which will continue this salvage work has to spend money in order to continue its activities, it has to be appropriated. Perhaps certain settlements have to be made, because there are contracts at stake. After all, a Government cannot simply throw contracts out of the window, Sir, because other parties are also involved. If certain amounts have to be paid out in the national interests, this has to be done and this Bill makes provision for that. I am sorry that no reference was made to this, because it is a very positive step.</p>
                        <p>What have we achieved so far? We have already recovered R15 million of the R64 million, and we already have bills to the amount of R14 million. In other words, the total amount collected and to be collected stands at R29 million. But we received no credit for this, Sir. And we shall continue the process of recovering that money. This is not the end of the matter. In fact, it forms an important part of the legislation before us.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, it is easy to talk about the irregularities that were involved in the spending of this money. We all deplore that. A small handful of people were unfortunately involved and this has caused all the trouble. But as far as the Government is concerned&#x2014; and, after all, it is the Government&#x2019;s action to bring this Bill before the House&#x2014;I think this is completely to the Government&#x2019;s credit. This is the action of a Government that says: I have nothing to hide. These things happen, and before this session of Parliament ends we have to regularize this financial matter procedurally. That is what we are trying to do.</p>

                        <p>We say now that those moneys that were passed in that way should now be regarded as having been appropriated. That is the main part of that side of it. And it does not in fact go further than that. There is nothing here that says that anything which anybody connected with the Department of Information may have done that might be regarded as irregular or have been found to be irregular, is involved here. We deplore that and we will do our very best to recover any amounts involved, as we have already done. We have put a specialized body in the field to do that, namely the State Trust Board, which will consist of specialists in this field. They will work every day to further protect the assets of the State involved and recover whatever moneys that can conceivably be recovered. And there will be further moneys recovered, as the future will prove. This body is going to be very active, Sir.</p>
                        <p>So, Mr. President, I say that we all deplore the irregularities that may have occurred as a result of the way in which certain projects were conducted. Many of these activities have been exposed, especially through the Erasmus Commission. But that side of it is not, in all fairness, involved in this legislation.</p>

                        <p>And I have just given my reply. A straight question and answer. But we can leave that there.</p>
                        <p>As far as 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> is concerned, Sir, let me just say this. 
                            <i>The Citizen</i> was being run at a loss. When this became known towards the end of September, October or November last year, immediate efforts were made to ascertain the full facts. The Pretorius Committee played a particularly important part in this respect. Because there were contracts involved and if the matter was not handled correctly there would be millions involved which the Government would be responsible for, it was recommended to us that the best thing to do would be to sell. Until then we did not know that this newspaper had been bought with State funds. The recommendation was to get rid of it as fast as possible in the best interests of the country. It had to be done to stop the current loss and to avoid any claims which we were told would certainly arise as a result of certain contracts running into millions of rands. I am satisfied as I stand here that it was the best decision we could take. It was a Cabinet decision based on the best information that could possibly have been obtained after a very full investigation.

                        <p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? The hon. the Minister has said that the amount that has been recovered plus what may still be recovered comes to something like R29 million. I think the figure that was involved was R64 million overall, of which it was said R32 million was for 
                            <i>The Citizen.</i> Can the hon. the Minister tell me how much of that R29 million that has been recovered comes from the R32 million that went into the financing of

                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to repeat something that I said at the Second Reading, namely, that I am opposed to the principle of the Information Service having a secret account. As I said to the hon. the Minister then, I believe that it would serve South Africa&#x2019;s interests best and the information which this service provides about South Africa, of whatever type it may be, would be more readily acceptable to people receiving it overseas if this were done openly and freely without any taint of its having a secret arm attached to it. It should be a department which can be shown to be divorced from any secret activities. Such a department would have far more chance of success in selling South Africa and countering propaganda against South Africa than a department which has a secret arm attached to it I say this freely acknowledging that it is necessary to have secret services handling propaganda for South Africa. I believe sincerely that the proper department for handling that sort of thing is the Department of Foreign Affairs which has the experience, it has the diplomats, it has people who are highly trained in dealing with people overseas. I do not believe that the Information Service is the right body to have a secret fund. I think experience has shown recently that this in fact is true; it should be left to the experts. We found that there were no experts in that department to conduct operations of a secret nature. All I am saying to the hon. the Minister is that I am not opposed to secret services but that I am opposed to this department carrying out those functions. Therefore I oppose the clause.</p>
                        <p>Clause agreed to (Senator L. E. D. Winchester dissenting).</p>
                    </speech>
                    <p>Clause 6:</p>

                        <from>Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I want to put into its correct perspective something the hon. the Minister referred to in reply to the Second Reading debate regarding my question as to when he became aware of the irregularities. I think if the hon. the Minister will take the trouble to read my Hansard later he will find that I said in my speech that he himself had admitted that he had had no knowledge of the secret projects on which certain funds were to be spent. It was as a result of that that I asked the hon. the Minister when he had really become aware of these irregularities. This is precisely the point I was trying to make in my Second Reading speech. The hon. the Minister must have signed authority for certain expenditure without knowing what those moneys were to be spent on. Am I correct? I assume I am correct and this was the point I made. Now we are being asked to regularize action of that sort in clause 6, which refers to the transfers. I have already said that in the first instance my party and I are not to be found for the authorization, whether technically or otherwise, of expenditure of this nature.</p>
                        <p>Then, Sir, I think I also made the point about the hon. the Minister of Defence who must have been aware in some way or other of the fact that there could have been irregular spending of these moneys, otherwise he would not have objected to these moneys being paid from his Defence Special Account; and, secondly, we would not have had that letter from Gen. Magnus Malan to Dr. Rhoodie in which he stated expressly that he objected to his Minister telling untruths in order to get extra money in a budget.</p>
                        <p>These are the things the hon. the Minister is asking us to regularize in this clause. It refers to certain transfers, and I say again, Sir, without wanting to waste too much of the time of this hon. House, that I find it impossible to support a clause of this nature.</p>

                        <p>Let us leave that point then. The point is that what I was not happy about was the fact of the transfer of money. Let me just say this, Mr. President: In this matter it was put to me: Here is an all-out effort to try to fight this great onslaught on South Africa. The motive was good. Of that I have no doubt to this day. I was told that in the first place certain moneys would be kept in the Defence Special Account and they would be used by Information as part of the total effort to counter this great propaganda campaign. It was said: This is the system; this has been going for some years; we must continue to keep it secret because there is no Information secret account. It was that that I objected to, and so did the Minister of Defence. I must say that in all fairness as he is not here. That continued for a while and by the middle of 1977 I had made up my mind that that should not continue, no matter how good the aim, but I did not know of 
                            <i>The Citizen;</i> I did not know of the big loan to Andre Pieterse and all the things that subsequently came into the picture. But I was not happy about the procedure involving the transfer of funds, and it was because of this that I began to try to discover whether we could not devise a way of bringing in a different system legally. That was why during the next session of Parliament&#x2014;I think it was in the early part of last session; I think it went through the Other Place in March&#x2014;I introduced the Secret Services Account Bill which I think has certainly contributed to straightening this whole matter out under the purview of the Treasury and the audit done by the Auditor-General. I think that is probably all I can say in that regard, Mr. President. That has been my attitude all along.

                            <i>The Citizen.</i> He said he was happy that what took place was in the best interests of South Africa; that the sale which took place was in the best interests of South Africa.

                            <i>The Citizen</i> to date. Perhaps he could inform this House, and the county for that matter, because the people are vitally interested in this subject. How much was recovered and how was it recovered?

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I rise merely to reply to a point made by the hon. the Minister in his reply to me. I just want to tell him that we do not disagree with the Government when it comes to the establishment of an account for secret services. As a matter of fact we fully support it. All that we require is that that account should be properly audited and looked after by people who not only have the authority to do it but also the ability and the training, e.g. the Auditor-General, and this Bill provides for that.</p>
                        <p>However, when it comes to the intentions&#x2014;the hon. the Minister said that he was fully in agreement with the intention&#x2014;the motivations behind the secret fund, viz. to counteract the onslaught on South Africa, the hon. the Minister will know that there is a very true saying which goes something like this: The road to a hotter place than Upington or Kuruman is paved with good intentions! This is exactly what was lacking in regard to the former Department of Information&#x2014;-there was no proper control of the funds.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister is now providing in clause 6 that these irregularities be regularized. Incidentally, Sir, I do not know where the word &#x201C;regularize&#x201D; comes from. I cannot find it in the Oxford Dictionary. It is a verb that seems to have developed a little later than the compilation of the last issue of the Oxford Dictionary. It must be some American slang expression. However, that is by the way.</p>
                        <p>If I understand the hon. the Minister correctly his intention in clause 6 is to legalize those transfers by passing this legislation. Am I correct?</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, the object of this clause is to validate certain transactions that have been entered into. Certain actions, settlements and expenditure are involved. I think we dealt with this matter 
                            <i>ad nauseam</i> during the Second Reading when we also discussed the question of 
                            <i>The Citizen.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister has referred to certain projects that were sound and essential projects during that period. The hon. the Minister mentioned an amount of R29 million which either he had already recovered or was about to be recovered, plus R32 million spent on 
                            <i>The Citizen</i>, according to the report of the commission. That already is an amount of over R60 million in round figures. In fact, therefore, not much money was spent on good projects. According to the reports it appears to me that there is an amount of R6 million unaccounted for. When we deduct that, very little remains that was spent on good projects in this whole matter.

                        <p>I am asking the hon. the Minister to clear up this matter for us. The hon. Senator Dempsey says my arithmetic is poor but I just want to say that I would never have attended his arithmetic classes. I believe he was a professor of economics. It appears to me that one can be a professor of economics without having to have a thorough knowledge of figures. [Interjections.] If he were to read the second report of the Erasmus Commission he would notice, for example, that the hon. the Minister signed a letter of authority involving R14,8 million whereas the schedules attached to that letter provided for approximately R7,7 million only. I prefer therefore not to ask a professor of economics to teach me arithmetic. In any case, this is merely by the way. For the same reason that we could not approve of clause 6 we cannot approve of clause 7. We must vote against the clause.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I note in clause 9 there is a limitation of three years for the prosecution of anyone referred to in clause 8. I wonder if the hon. the Minister can tell us why there is that limitation of three years? In other words, after three years the people concerned will no longer be liable to be prosecuted. Perhaps the hon. the Minister might tell us if he has any information about any pending prosecutions of certain people. I know it is not in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s province but if he has any information I should be glad to have it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, just to reply to the last part of that question first, the Police are making various investigations and certain matters have been referred to the Attorney-General. I understand that both of these parties are fully engaged in these investigations and one will have to see what comes out of it. But the Police are definitely engaged in making various investigations.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the three years, my information is that this was put in here because this is a fairly normal sort of provision in such a case. I am afraid I am not an expert in this regard but should the hon. Senator feel that this is unreasonable I would certainly be prepared to look at it again. The information I have, however, is that the law advisers were of the opinion that this was a reasonable period.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. the Minister. In fact, the three year period is usually for the prescription of certain minor offences. Murder and offences of that sort, of course, never become prescribed; they remain. But 3 years is the rule of the common law in respect of certain offences. They are usually minor offences and some of these visualized here may be very major offences. I should be glad if the hon. the Minister would look at this again.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I shall not take up much of the time of this hon. House in discussing the Third Reading. [Interjections.] But then hon. Senators must not challenge me. It is possible even at this stage, Sir, if I may remind hon. Senators, to ask for the privilege of the hour.</p>
                        <p>The impression one gained from the speeches made during the Second Reading was that an attempt was being made by means of this legislation to get away from the Information scandal as quickly as possible. It would appear, as the hon. Senator Van Rensburg has said, that by means of the legislation before us today, we want to bury tee Information scandal and to relegate it to tee past. As a matter of fact, he used the word &#x201C;funeral&#x201D; and then he said we should try to secure the best possible dividends from it. Mr. President, as far as I know there is only one person who receives a dividend from any funeral and that is the undertaker himself. In this case it appears to me that the undertaker is the Government itself. They will probably be the only people who will receive any dividends from this matter. But South Africa itself will not in this way and by means of this legislation be able to rid itself of the blot that the Information scandal has placed on it.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, the real motives have become evident from the speeches of various hon. Senators. The hon. Senator La Grange, in particular, came out into the open when he said that, no matter how, he wanted to get away from this Information Scandal. He said that as long as this legislation was instrumental in doing that he did not care what it validated or did not validate as long as it helped in putting the scandal behind us.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I rise merely to thank hon. Senators for their contributions during this debate. It is very clear that there is a fundamental difference of opinion between the official Opposition and ourselves as far as this matter is concerned. They are entitled to their point of view just as we are entitled to ours, I suppose, and consequently we shall just have to agree to differ.</p>
                        <p>If I understood the hon. Senator Oelrich correctly, he said the matter had to be cleared up correctly or properly. I want therefore to put this question once again: If it is not done in this way as far as financial procedures are concerned, how can it possibly be done? What other way is there in which the matter can be finalized? I think that is a fair question.</p>

                        <p>No, Mr. President, surely those are two different matters. The question of the evidence is one thing and the question of the financial procedures to be followed is something else. That is the issue at stake, Sir, with due respect.

                        <p>As hon. Senators know housing for urban Blacks, as well as for other population communities, is financed from the National Housing Fund. Primarily as a result of policy considerations Black housing was not provided on the same basis as housing for Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics before 1 April this year. Advances from the Housing Fund for the execution of housing schemes for Blacks were allocated only at an eco nomic interest rate, while subsidized interest rates were applicable to the housing of certain lower income cadres of the other population groups. However, housing assistance for Blacks was obtained from various other sources, for example liquor and sorghum beer profits.</p>
                        <p>A Government resolution that housing shall, from 1 April 1979 be provided on the same basis as the other population groups from the Housing Fund, has meant that new rented dwellings for Blacks with an income of up to R150 per month may in future be provided with money at 1% interest per annum. For the R150 to R250 per month income group, new dwellings will be provided at a rental based on the differential interest rate of 3½% interest per annum. Standards of dwellings and services will in future also be in keeping with those that apply to the other groups, due regard being had of course for the ability of the occupants in question to pay for them. Furthermore it will also be possible to provide community facilities on the same basis in Black residential areas as in the residential areas of the other communities.</p>
                        <p>In terms of the Housing Act, as it applies at present, the National Housing Commission considers applications for advances by local authorities for the execution of housing schemes for Whites, Coloureds and Indians, while the Black Housing Board considers applications from Administration Boards in respect of housing for Blacks in the urban areas.</p>
                        <p>The question therefore, arose whether, in view of the elimination of the differences in the basis on which dwellings for Blacks and other communities are being provided, there was any need for the Black Housing Board to remain in existence. I consulted the Minister of Co-operation and Development and he agrees that the need for the Black Housing Board to exist has now disappeared, because we believe that the new dispensation will lead to greater efficiency and uniformity, which will be in the interests of everyone, in particular those of the Black communities.</p>
                        <p>A member of the Coloured community and a member of the Indian community are already serving on the National Housing Commission where they have a full say in the field of national housing and participate in the decision-making processes in this regard.</p>
                        <p>If the proposals in this Bill with regard to the abolition of the Black Housing Board are accepted, which will entail that the National Housing Commission will deal with Black housing as well, it will, in my opinion, be desirable to have a member of the Black community serving on the commission as well. Apart from that, owing to the special interests that Administration Boards have in the matter, the Minister of Co-operation and Development and I think that provision should be made for the appointment of another additional member to the commission so that the Administration Boards can also have representation on it. The membership of the National Housing Commission will, therefore, have to be increased by two for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>The Bill before this House seeks to give effect to the premises that I have tried to outline here. The proposals are, in my opinion, in the interests of better administration and also of better race relations, and I trust that they will meet with general support.</p>
                        <p>As will be noticed, we envisage putting this legislation into effect on a date to be fixed by the State President by proclamation in the 
                            <i>Gazette.</i> The reason for this is that the terms of office of members of the Black Housing Board have not yet expired and that a date for the earlier termination of their terms of office will have to be negotiated with them, after which the legislation will be put into effect. No problems are foreseen in this regard.

                        <p>Mr. President, I listened to the explanation given by the hon. the Minister and I think the Government is really doing something very good here. The Black Housing Board is being abolished and in future everything will fall under the Housing Act of 1966. We also welcome the fact that a Black person will be appointed and that the number of members is to be increased to a minimum of 11 and not more than 14. I think the way the committee is to be constituted is also an improvement. Architects and town planners and so forth will serve on it. The committee will be very well constituted and we support the legislation.</p>

This side of the House supports it fully and because there is unanimity and so much goodwill, it is not necessary to say any more about the technical aspects of the Housing Commission or to go into the matter in depth. I just want to thank the hon. the Minister for the clear explanation he has given here. I want to express the hope that with the presence of a Black representative on the commission, together with the Indian and Coloured representatives who are already there, all interested parties will now be satisfied that the Department of Community Development has dealt correctly with this matter and has seen to it that there is reasonableness, justice and fairness without respect to persons. We hope that it is a step forward with a view to the better relations and attitudes which we want. We also hope that it will serve as a chain in which we can all participate. We have been convinced once again that the Department of Community Development has immersed itself so deeply in this matter of housing that there is really no weak link in the chain. We support this legislation.</p>

Senator Dr. Scheepers, and to my good friend, Senator Prinsloo, for the support they have given this measure. One is pleased to see that when a progressive step is taken in connection with the housing of all sections of our population, there is this unanimity among the representatives of our nation. I really do appreciate it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, allow me to say a few words first. As you know, I am not really conversant with the traditions and customs of this Upper House of Parliament and, when I arrived here earlier this afternoon, I made an interjection. I am very sorry about this, Mr. President, and I humbly apologize to this House for having made an interjection here before having made my maiden speech. I should like to respect and honour the traditions of this hon. House.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, for the information of hon. Senators I should like to mention that the new format in which the Bill was presented last year proved to be a great success and it is again being submitted in the same form this year as will be the case in future.</p>
                        <p>Like last year, this enables the Department of Customs and Excise to draft the Bill at a much earlier stage so that the proposed amendments to the text of the principal. Act could be submitted to representative bodies of commerce and industry such as the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, Assocom, FCI and SASAFAA for comments. Comments and proposals were received from these bodies and where practicable such proposals were incorporated in the Bill now before the House.</p>
                        <p>In terms of the existing definition of &#x201C;manufacture&#x201D; in section 1 of the Customs and Excise Act, 1964, the Secretary for Customs and Excise may in his discretion only determine when the process of packing or measuring off of any excisable goods should be regarded as a dutiable operation. This limitation places a mandatory obligation upon the Secretary to levy excise duty on certain functions&#x2014;particularly in the jewellery trade&#x2014;which should not be regarded as dutiable operations.</p>
                        <p>In order to overcome this problem clause 1 of the Bill provides for a much wider discretion by the Secretary in determining whether a certain process or function should be regarded as a dutiable operation.</p>
                        <p>Since the advent of the general sales tax the Department of Customs and Excise has been collecting sales tax on imported goods at the time of entry for home consumption on behalf of the Department of Inland Revenue. Presently section 4(3) of the principal Act debars a customs and excise officer from divulging to the Secretary for Inland Revenue any information regarding sales tax which he may have acquired in the performance of his duties. Clause 2 rectifies this anomalous situation in that a customs and excise officer may, for the purposes of the Sales Tax Act, 1978, divulge information to the Secretary for Inland Revenue or to an officer designated by that Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Clause 3 provides for the State not to be held liable for any loss or damage sustained due to the wrong delivery of any goods from a State warehouse. As regards this provision I would like to mention that it is not the intention that the Department of Customs and Excise should be protected against wrongful delivery arising from gross carelessness or negligence. The provision is merely intended to absolve the State from liability when goods are released to the importer in good faith against valid documentation and a party with an interest like a bank, claims title thereto and institutes a claim against the Department of Customs and Excise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, clause 4(a) requires no clarification except to mention that the purpose referred to, is whether the goods concerned are being entered for the purpose of payment of duty, warehousing, etc.</p>
                        <p>I will deal with clause 4(b) together with clause 6, but first I would like to explain clause 5. This clause is a protective measure as far as importers are concerned. Presently, where an importer&#x2019;s goods are conveyed at his risk in all respects, the carrier of the goods is not liable for the duty even where the goods are lost after having been placed in a transit shed under the control of the carrier. This in effect means that the importer will be liable for the duty on such lost goods even though they were still under the control of the carrier. Clause 5(a) provides for the carrier to be liable for the duty under the aforementioned circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The proposed amendment embodied in clause 5(b) is of a technical nature and will enable the Department of Customs and Excise to act more effectively in cases of tax evasion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, it is well known that South Africa is a member of the Customs Co-operation Council and has for tariff classification purposes given legal status to the Explanatory Notes to the Nomenclature issued by that</p>
                        <p>Council. One of the council&#x2019;s principles relating to tariff classification is that a member country&#x2019;s customs administration must give binding tariff classifications.</p>
                        <p>It has for some time been considered that sections 2 and 3 of the principal Act provided sufficient authority for any tariff classification by the Secretary for Customs and Excise to be considered binding. I may add that this was apparently also the opinion of some of the representatives of organized trade and industry who commented on this proposed amendment of the principal Act. In a court case (Autoware (Pty.) Ltd. versus the Secretary for Customs and Excise) the judge ruled as follows regarding the provisions of section 2 of the principal Act&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">In my judgment section 2(1) relates purely to matters of administration, it charges the Secretary with the duty, in the ordinary course of the administration of the Act, to interpret one of its schedules when such an interpretation is necessary: It has no bearing on the jurisdiction of a court which has to resolve a dispute involving an interpretation of the Act or one of its schedules or upon the procedure in such litigation or the rights or duties of the litigants therein.</block>
                        <p>As regards the provisions of section 3(2) of the Customs and Excise Act I may mention that legal opinion was obtained and it was evident that section 3(2) of the Act equally does not confer the right upon the Secretary for Customs and Excise to make binding tariff classifications. The effect of this situation is that in terms of section 47(1) of the Act importers are in the position where they will be liable for the payment of the correct duties for as long as 30 years after the duty became payable-debts to the State mature after 30 years. Obviously this places not only the Department of Customs and Excise but also importers in a very onerous situation.</p>
                        <p>The proposed amendment of section 47 of the principal Act embodied in clause 6 will firstly enable the Secretary to make binding tariff determinations. Secondly, in cases where a determination has not been made, importers&#x2019; liabilities for the payment of the correct duties will lapse after two years instead of 30 years. Thirdly, it provides for a tariff determination to be published in the 
                            <i>Gazette</i> by the Secretary within 90 days from the date of such determination. In view of this fact and the fact that importers will be in possession of binding determinations it follows that importers will be liable for the payment of the correct duties with effect from the date of such determinations. In cases of 
                            <i>mala fides</i> liability for the payment of the correct duty can obviously not be limited.
                        </p>
                        <p>The fact that the Secretary may make binding tariff determinations in no way detracts from the right of importers to appeal against such determinations and specific provision is made in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Secretary must be in a position to amend a determination even with retrospective effect. It must be accepted that situations may arise where a perfectly valid determination was made based on the information available at that time and that in the light of new information which came to light at a later stage it is found that the original determination should be reviewed. If there is no provision for the Secretary to amend an original determination under these circumstances, the situation may arise where the lack of such a provision is to be to the detriment of the importer in that he might have been paying duty at a higher rate and that he could have been granted a refund of the duty overpaid had such a provision existed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, this is the whole purpose of this provision for the retroactive review of a determination by the Secretary. It is not intended that this particular provision be applied to the detriment of importers&#x2014;the purpose most definitely is a benevolent application in the interests of importers. This is new legislation and where interpretive problems may arise which have merit I will not object to the Secretary for Customs and Excise solving the particular problem administratively until such time as it can be set right in the following year&#x2019;s amending Bill.</p>
                        <p>I may mention at this stage that the hon. the Minister of Finance personally interviewed representatives from the South African Clearing and Forwarding Agents Association who are of course intimately affected by the provisions of clause 6. They held in-depth discussions and the hon. the Minister listened to their points of view. He also explained to them his viewpoints and the reasons for the proposed provisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, the provisions of clause 6 are very comprehensive and I do not want to take up too much time in discussing them in too great detail. I would, however, like to mention that there is also provision for the Secretary to publish tariff determinations in the 
                            <i>Government Gazette.</i> In view of the amount of preparatory work involved it is proposed that the provisions of clause 6 come into operation on 1 October 1979.
                        </p>
                        <p>I undertook to deal with clause 4(b) together with clause 6. Clause 4(b) provides for a person entering imported goods to furnish such information regarding the tariff classification of the goods concerned as the Secretary may require. Where an importer has obtained a tariff determination it is important that he should provide the necessary information so as to eliminate any unnecessary delays in clearing the goods. As from 1 October 1979 importers will also be able to refer to the particular 
                            <i>Government Gazette</i> in which a determination has been published.
                        </p>
                        <p>*The comprehensive computerization project which the Department of Customs and Excise is undertaking, necessitates the value of imported goods being expressed in figures to the nearest rand. Clause 7 makes particular provision for this.</p>
                        <p>The proposed amendment of section 66 of the Customs and Excise Act as contained in clause 8, eliminates obscurities in the existing provisions with regard to the place of export and the expenditure and costs that have to be taken into account in the definition of the normal price of imported goods.</p>
                        <p>As far as clause 10 is concerned, I should like to explain paragraphs (a) and (b) further. The provisions as contained in clause 10(a) are nothing new to the Department of Customs and Excise or to the petroleum industry. In fact, the provisions of the clause give substance to a practice that has been followed since 1959.</p>
                        <p>As far as paragraph (b) is concerned, I should like to mention that it happens virtually every year that rebate provisions have to be formulated to assist manufacturers in cases where they have cleared goods with rebate on duty while such goods could in fact not be cleared in terms of the rebate provision.</p>
                        <p>Up to the present this problem has been solved by including it with retrospective effect in the amending Act of the particular year. Because it is in the interests of manufacturers to rectify matters of this nature as quickly as possible, I propose that the hon. the Minister of Finance be placed in the position to implement the rebate provisions involved by way of notice in the 
                            <i>Government Gazette</i> with retrospective effect at the time of the formulation of such rebate provisions, where he deems this to be in the public interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>While I am dealing with the question of retrospective effect, I want to refer again to clause 6 at this stage in order to stress the purpose of the proposed provisions clearly. When one looks at the provisions of clause 6 and clause 10(b), it is clear that their whole purpose is to place the Minister and the Secretary for Customs and Excise in a position to assist importers in certain specific circumstances. I am referring here in particular to the repayment of duty in circumstances for which provision is not normally made in the principal Act The proof that this is the aim we have in mind is contained in clause 13, in which no fewer than five cases of this nature are dealt with. The same phenomenon appeared in the amending Acts of previous years. I want therefore to stress once again that the purpose of these proposed provisions is to render assistance and not to create difficulties, as some persons and bodies interpret it. I trust that hon. members will also view it in this light.</p>
                        <p>Clause 12 deals with the responsibility of agents who act on behalf of, for instance, importers, exporters, licence-holders and manufacturers. I want to point out at the outset that objections were lodged to the proposed provisions. Basically the objections were in effect that an agent acted by order of his principal and that, instead of extending the agent&#x2019;s liability it should rather be restricted.</p>
                        <p>The factual position is, however, that &#x201C;importer&#x201D;, as defined in section 1(1) of the Customs and Excise Act also includes a person who acts on behalf of the importer. As the agent receives the rights of the importer in terms of the principal Act, the agent is at present in the position of being able to decide on an arbitrary basis which of the liabilities of the importer he wants to meet. This situation is undesirable because in practice it is the agent who renders the expert service. The agent should therefore not be in the position where he can shirk responsibility for his actions in a specific case.</p>
                        <p>I should like to point out that in terms of the existing provisions of section 99(1) of the Customs and Excise Act, an agent who acts on behalf of a master; pilot or container operator in a particular case, is liable for fulfilling all the obligations that have been imposed on the particular master, pilot or container operator.</p>
                        <p>In view of this I cannot see why the agent who acts on behalf of an importer should in any way be placed in the position where he can decide which liabilities he wants to accept and which he does not want to accept.</p>
                        <p>The Customs Co-operation Council has been giving attention to the question of the liability of third parties for quite some time, and a document with the title &#x201C;Draft Annex Concerning the Relationship Between Customs Authorities and Third Parties&#x201D; was sent to member countries last year for their consideration. The Annex was accepted unanimously by all the member countries on 16 May of this year during the session of the Council in Australia. In this regard I should like to quote the following from the Annex for the information of hon. members&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">Principals shall be held jointly and severally responsible with third parties before the Customs for any duties and taxes, as well as for any irregularities and any consequent penalties or fines.</block>
                        <p>That is exactly what is being provided for in the proposed provisions as far as third parties are concerned.</p>
                        <p>During the interview to which I have already referred, the provisions of this clause were also discussed thoroughly, and although I agree that only a small percentage of the agents are not always prepared to fulfil their responsibilities towards their clients, this clause is of particular importance. For the vast majority of agents who realize what their responsibilities are, the proposed provisions should create no problems.</p>
                        <p>Besides the ratification of the amendments which were made before 2 February 1979 in respect of Schedules 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the principal Act, provision is also being made in clause 13, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, for amending the scales of customs and excise duty, as well as the surcharge which was promulgated on 29 March 1979.

                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. the Deputy Minister made a few introductory remarks in connection with his first official appearance in this House. I should like to congratulate him most warmly on his introductory speech here and I should also like to congratulate him on his appointment to the post he now occupies. It is a most responsible office. We are engaged with the revision of taxation in the financial sphere in South Africa and we are also engaged in a programme of continued and increasing growth for the future. It is the wish of this side of the House that the hon. the Deputy Minister will contribute his full share to this and that the period of his Deputy Ministership will be a fruitful one.</p>
                        <p>The legislation which the hon. the Deputy Minister has introduced in this House today is taxation legislation of a very technical nature. All taxation legislation is very technical. But when we come to matters like customs and excise, they are so diverse in so many spheres that it is very difficult to keep fully acquainted with all the technical aspects of the different departments. While I am speaking of taxation legislation, however, I should just like to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that this is the sort of legislation which in its wording and definitions must leave no doubt in the mind of the person reading it as to the interpretation of a clause or a subsection. If that happens one finds oneself in trouble. One can find oneself involved in all sorts of difficult situations such as court cases and so on. That is why we on the Opposition side will always try if matters are not clear to us and if certain definitions are not clear to effect technical amendments which may be of assistance to the hon. the Minister and his department.</p>
                        <p>I do not want to go further into the various provisions of this legislation except to say that we support it. It is actually legislation which one should deal with in the Committee Stage. The various clauses, as the hon. the Deputy Minister knows, deal with various aspects of customs and excise. I think we should take the Committee Stage directly and then exchange ideas. We support the legislation.</p>

Much is said in Parliament, of course, in the respective Houses, but I think that ten or twenty times more is said in the lobbies. When the hon. the Deputy Minister was appointed I did not know him very well because the membership of the NP is very large. But wherever I go I hear people speaking well of him. His appointment is a popular one, he is competent to fill the post and we on this side of the House are pleased to welcome him here on the occasion of the introduction of his first Bill. We wish him prosperity for the future and thank him for the competent way in which he has introduced the Bill.</p>

I want to say that I welcome him to this Upper House on behalf of the Independents. Perhaps he made a small mistake but who does not make mistakes, Sir? He should not be too disturbed about it. Perhaps he is disturbed because in fact he said just the opposite to what hon. Senators on his side said in the previous debate. But that is a matter they can settle among themselves. I wish the hon. the Deputy Minister everything of the best in this very important portfolio and, where previously he had a great deal to do with another matter, I trust he will not find himself in deep water but that he will acquit himself well of his task.</p>

                        <p>The point I want to make to the hon. the Deputy Minister is that although he said this in his Second Reading speech, it is not included in the Bill before us. As I said in my short Second Reading speech, Sir, tax laws should be clear. There should be no doubt as to what the intention is or how the laws should be interpreted. Therefore I wish to move the following amendment to insert virtually the very words that the hon. the Deputy Minister used, namely&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, goods are taken into the State warehouse when some or other legal requirement has not been complied with. That is the point. When some of the requirements are not complied with, those goods are taken into the State warehouse. This is as security to cover any duty which might be due on those goods or to keep those goods in safe custody if they are illegal goods. As I said in my Second Reading speech&#x2014;and I want to repeat this&#x2014;it is not the intention to protect the department against negligence. Mr. Chairman, the State must always be reasonable and if one of its officials has erred, the State will assume liability in all fairness.</p>
                        <p>Hon. Senators&#x2019; attention is directed to the existing section 17(3) in terms of which neither the State nor any official is held to be liable for any loss or diminution of or damage to any goods in a State warehouse. But this section is never used to protect the department or any of its officials in the case of negligence. I think we must see in this that the State is actually forced to take certain goods into custody, not because of the negligence of the State but because of failure on the part of another party. Now the State, because of the duty to be levied, must take those goods into custody. If the State releases those goods properly against legal documents and a problem occurs later and claims, etc., are instituted, it would in my view not be reasonable to claim compensation. In the first place the State is not responsible for the fact that those goods were in the State warehouse and, should a mistake occur, it would not be fair to expect the State to be responsible for damage to those goods. In the light of what I have just said, I should like to ask the hon. Senator to reconsider his attitude.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, we are well aware of the circumstances under which goods end up in a State warehouse. Nevertheless I do feel that there is a certain responsibility on the State. The hon. the Deputy Minister said this clearly in his Second Reading speech namely: &#x201C;As regards this provision I would like to mention that it is not the intention that the Department of Customs and Excise should be protected against wrongful delivery arising from gross carelessness or negligence.&#x201D; Because the words &#x201C;or in respect of any loss or damage sustained by reason of wrong delivery of such goods&#x201D; is now being added to the subsection, in my view it would only be fair for the hon. the Deputy Minister to reassure importers by accepting the proviso I have moved by way of amendment to this subsection. I do not think that we can relieve the State of all responsibility in this case, notwithstanding the fact that in many cases it is forced to take goods into the warehouse as security or for other reasons. That is not at issue now. The fact that the State must also carry a responsibility in this respect&#x2014;after all, it is only a small responsibility&#x2014;is important. If the State, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, will compensate people in any case, it will do no harm to accept this amendment.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened to the hon. Senator&#x2019;s request, but I still hold the view that in the first place such goods ended up in the State warehouse because of the negligence of certain people. This is something to which one must give serious attention. A similar objection was raised in the Other Place and I undertook to have another look at this provision. It is not the intention to protect officials of my department against negligence because that results in inefficiency. The intention of this clause, however, is to protect the State against a 
                            <i>bona fide</i> mistake. But I undertake to reconsider this provision and obtain another legal opinion on it. I shall ascertain precisely what the legal implications of this provision are. If it is in fact possible that somebody could suffer loss as a result of negligence on the part of the State, I shall implement the provision in the course of the year in such a way that nobody will suffer. I can then come back to this House next year with an amendment if the legal opinion is such that there may be cases where the State is protected by legislation. Does that satisfy the hon. Senator?

Clause 5(a) adds the following proviso to section 44(4) of the principal Act: &#x201C;provided such goods have not been landed and placed in a transit shed appointed or prescribed under section 6(1)&#x201D;. My problem and my question to the hon. the Deputy Minister is whether a container depot is a transit shed. If it is not, I think we will have to amend this clause accordingly. If a container depot is considered not to fall within the ambit of the definition of a &#x201C;transit shed&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, clause 6 constitutes a most important part of this Bill.</p>
                        <p>†The proposed new section 47(9)(d) provides that&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">The Secretary may whenever he deems it expedient amend any such determination or withdraw it and make a new determination with effect from&#x2014;</block>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(i) the date of first entry of the goods in question;</li>
                            <li>(ii) the date of the notice referred to in paragraph (c);</li>
                            <li>(iii) the date of the determination made under paragraph (a);</li>
                            <li>(iv) the date of such new determination; or</li>
                            <li>(v) the date of such amendment.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>It is the considered opinion of this side of the House that we should amend this paragraph by adding the words &#x201C;provided that any new determination shall not increase the amount of duty payable, unless a false declaration has been made or false or incorrect information was furnished&#x201D;. We have no problems with this clause if this is the case, but in the case of people who have paid the duty and who have acted above board I think this provision is a bit harsh. I do not think that whenever he deems it expedient the Secretary should be able to amend a determination or withdraw it and make a new determination. If he does make a new determination I think it only fair that provision should be made that the amount of the duty payable will not be increased unless the importer has been at fault. I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, in this regard I wish to draw the attention of the hon. Senator to the proposed new section 47(9)(e) which provides that&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">An appeal against any such determination shall lie to the Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa having jurisdiction to hear appeals in the area wherein the determination was made or the goods in question were entered for home consumption.</block>
                        <p>This paragraph clearly indicates that the determination is not final and that there is a right of appeal against such a determination.</p>
                        <p>*I just want to inform the hon. Senator that unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment since there could be other circumstances for which specific provision has to be made in the Bill. In respect of clause 6, I just wish to state that this is a new provision and, as I have already said in my Second Reading speech, the section will be rectified in next year&#x2019;s amendment Bill if any problems of interpretation should arise which appear to be justified. In the meantime the Secretary for Customs and Excise will be able to deal administratively with such cases as do occur.</p>
                        <p>I also said that the retrospective provision would be applied with great circumspection. I understand the hon. Senator&#x2019;s argument in regard to the retrospective provision.</p>
                        <p>There are objections to this retrospective provision, but hon. Senators should not lose sight of the legal implications of the legal opinion and the judgment, to which I referred. The legal implications of the judgment and the opinion is that the Secretary for Customs and Excise now has to recover any duty restrospectively for 30 years&#x2014;he now has to recover it retrospectively for 30 years&#x2014;because the period of prescription differs in the case of the State, unless another period is determined by legislation. The proposed provision has this advantage, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, that it limits the actions of the department to a retrospective period of only two years. In cases where a determination has been furnished to an importer, surely it follows that the importer has to apply such determination consistently and if he does not do so, the Secretary for Customs and Excise may and shall recover any duty payable up to the date on which such a determination was made. The question of the retrospective effect in the case where the provisions of the Act have been contravened is in any case as old as customs itself. For example, where an inspector carries out an inspection at present, as in the past, and finds irregularities in the books of an importer, such importer is assessed for a period of two years, and if 
                            <i>mala fides</i> is proved, he is assessed for a longer period. Consequently this is by no means a new principle as regards the cases where irregularities can be proved. This is the position as it was, and all that is being added now, Mr. Chairman, is that this power is now without that limitation on irregularities. But the fact is, Mr. Chairman, that the Secretary will not act if there are no serious irregularities, and as has already been said, in general these people are honest, but one must ensure that the legislation has teeth in order to clamp down on those people who cause trouble. This is the background to this provision.

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has now given a rather more detailed reply but nevertheless I am still not satisfied with his interpretation of this clause. In the first place the hon. the Deputy Minister referred me to paragraph (e) which reads&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">An appeal against any such determination shall lie to the division of the Supreme Court of South Africa having jurisdiction &#x2026; in the area wherein the determination was made &#x2026;</block>
                        <p>That is fine. But the point is that one is not really keen to go to court. The hon. the Deputy Minister must have another look at this provision&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">&#x2026; shall lie to the division of the Supreme Court of South Africa &#x2026;</block>
                        <p>These matters are not cheap. This costs a lot of money. It means that instead of the usual attorney as one&#x2019;s legal adviser or the man to defend one in these matters, one has to employ an advocate, and those people are not cheap. I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister should not accept this amendment. I agree with him that there are people who will deliberately and maliciously contravene the law. We always find that. We find it in many sections of our society but there are also people who import with every good intention and still contravene the law. This Act is not something one should look at lightly. It is complicated legislation and that is why I should like to see this proviso which I have moved as part of this legislation. The backdating of such an agreement could have far-reaching consequences, and I think the hon. the Deputy Minister would really be doing the right thing if he accepted this amendment. If there is not time at this stage of the session to consider such an amendment and to take it back to the Other Place, could the hon. the Deputy Minister not at least give me the assurance that during the recess he will reconsider the position and possibly introduce amending legislation next year. That will reassure the importers.</p>

                        <p>Suppose the Secretary made some unfair stipulation of an importer. If that importer has supplied false information he does not of course, have a case, and he has to pay; we all agree with that. But if that importer, or the agent acting on his behalf, says to the Secretary: But look, you have made a mistake &#x2026; You know, these clearing agents are experts in that field; they are absolute experts and I think we all agree with that. He might say to the Secretary: You are making a mistake, that is not a reasonable assessment. If the Secretary does not agree with him that agent has the right to go to the Supreme Court. I know it is expensive but you must remember that the Secretary is not anxious to lose a case in the Supreme Court either. He will try to act reasonably because what reason could the Secretary have for discriminating against an agent who submits facts to him which prove that the Secretary&#x2019;s declaration was wrong? In fairness he can also have recourse to the Minister and say to him: That Secretary of yours, look what he has done to me; here is my proof and he does not want to accept it. I would say it is not even necessary for that importer to go to the Supreme Court.

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, this clause deals with retrospectivity. It reads,

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, may I just explain to the hon. Senator that the point of departure in this clause is not really to increase duty with retrospective effect. The matter at issue is the control of fuels as mentioned here. If one looks at clauses 6 and 10(b), it is clear that the objective of the Minister and the Secretary for Customs and Excise is to enable them to help certain importers under certain circumstances. I refer in particular to the repayment of duty in circumstances which normally are not provided for in the principal Act. The proof that this is the objective is contained in clause 13 where no fewer than five such cases are dealt with. The same thing appears in the amending Acts of previous years. This refers to diesel oil etc. for farm use on which a repayment can be made. That is what this is all about. There must be strict control because hon. Senators will understand that if that duty is not paid by the people who should pay it&#x2014;certain hauliers have misused the position in regard to the farm use of diesel, etc.&#x2014;the Secretary must have the right to the collection of that duty retrospectively where there is insufficient proof that that fuel was used for the purpose for which a rebate was allowed. That is what this whole clause is about.</p>
                        <p>The intention of clause 5 is not prosecution. The hon. Senator will see that five exemptions are provided for in clause 13. These are repayments made by way of legislation. I want to give the hon. Senator the assurance that the whole object is not to prosecute or to punish but in fact to help. But there must of course be proper control, otherwise there will be widespread malpractices and the evasion of the payment of customs and excise duties.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I am not so sure that we are not talking at cross-purposes. As far as I can see, the Afrikaans text reads better than the English text. It reads: &#x201C;Die Minister kan, wanneer hy dit in die openbare belang dienstig ag&#x201D; amend such a schedule with retrospective effect from the date indicated in the notice. If he considers it to be in the public interest, and he amends the schedule with retrospective effect, it must be stated clearly that the duty will not be increased. That is all we ask. As he has the right to amend it and to make it retrospective, we ask only that it should be stated clearly that there will be no increase in the duty, except, of course, in cases where, as the hon. the Minister has also clearly said, there is a wrongful intent when supplying information or making false declarations. That, of course, is a horse of a different colour. The hon. the Minister has definitely said that it is not the intention to increase the duty. But if that is not written into the Act, the hon. the Minister will also have the right, when he amends a schedule, to increase the duty.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>Last year, in the course of the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Finance when he was introducing the Second Reading of the Sales Tax Bill, he said, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, in his introduction that it was expected that the new tax would be a virile one which would give the fiscal authorities greater freedom of movement to plan a more flexible tax policy and to provide, with the tax revenues which a naturally growing source such as a sales tax can produce without having to increase the rate, the means of attaining those economic, social and educational goals which it was not possible to attain with our then existing limited and overburdened tax sources.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although we have only just commenced our tax reform programme I am certain that hon. members would like to know how matters stand with the new tax and what has been achieved in the first financial year in which the tax was in force, viz. the period 3 July 1978 to 31 March 1979.</p>
                        <p>In the first place the administration of the tax, from the outset, functioned unexpectedly smoothly for a new tax, both for the private sector that has to collect the tax as well as my department which is involved in the implementation of the Act. Admittedly there were the birth pains without which nothing can come into existence, and during the first two to three weeks the staff had to be on their toes to solve a host of minor problems. Quick decisions had to be taken, and sometimes incorrect rulings were given which came to light subsequently&#x2014;and are still doing so even at this juncture&#x2014;and had to be rectified.</p>
                        <p>In the legislation which is now being proposed there are in fact measures&#x2014;which I shall discuss later&#x2014;to afford protection to enterprises in cases where, in those first hectic days, and perhaps afterwards as well, incorrect rulings were given.</p>
                        <p>The success which was achieved may be attributed mainly to the talks between my department and organized commerce, industry and agriculture which went on for months, the literally hundreds of seminars, meetings, discussion groups, radio and television interviews, etc., in which both the private sector and my department participated, and the co-operation and mutual trust which was created in this way. Even now the Secretary and his department are still adopting an open door policy and there are few days when discussion of a more specialized nature pertaining to particular enterprises do not still take place. Many of the amendments which are being proposed by this amendment Bill, had their origin in these very talks.</p>
                        <p>When the Standing Commission on Tax Policy proposed the introduction of a general sales tax at the point of final sale, it recommended that the work be entrusted to the Department of Inland Revenue, provided that that department was able to obtain sufficient staff for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the pressing necessity that there be no delay in the tax structure reform the planning was proceeded with and the staff were gradually recruited and trained. Hon. members will understand that it was not possible to recruit officers who could provide guidance from among people without a tax background, and consequently experienced tax officers had to be drawn from other sectors of the department, and their positions filled in turn with less experienced staff. This entailed that experienced officers, who are always a scarce commodity, had to be moved around to cover all activities of the department. In some offices accommodation problems were experienced, and the sales tax divisions had to be housed in other buildings. This is an undesirable practice, but it will gradually be rectified so that the public will be inconvenienced as little as possible.</p>
                        <p>But owing to the enthusiasm and loyalty of the staff the battle has been won, and I wish to convey to them and to the enterprises in the private sector the sincere thanks of the Minister and the Government as well as my own.</p>
                        <p>What was the overall result? In the first place hon. members will recall that the estimated revenue from this source, viz. general sales tax, announced by the Minister in his budget speech in 1978 was set at R650 million for the 1978-&#x2019;79 financial year. Criticism was levelled at us from various quarters and we were told that the estimate was hopelessly too low. The final proceeds, unaudited, are R654 million. It ought to be noted that this is an underestimate by the Department of only 0,6%.</p>
                        <p>In the second place the tax clearly demonstrated what it was capable of, and a further step could be taken in the programme of tax reform, as was clearly reflected in the tax proposals of the hon. the Minister this year.</p>
                        <p>I am deliberately discussing what has been achieved here. Because it is such an important milestone, I think it is important that hon. members be informed of the functioning of measures established by legislation of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>The explanatory memorandum on the Bill which has been issued to hon. members and which was made available in manuscript form to the finance groups of all parties some time ago, furnishes detailed explanations of the various amendments which are being proposed in the Bill, and hon. members will not take it amiss of me if I concentrate only on a few matters that justify further elucidation. For the most part the measures in the Bill are aimed at improving the administrative provisions to facilitate even further the smooth functioning of the Act and to eliminate snags which have been encountered in its practical implementation.</p>
                        <p>The first matter I want to touch on is the question of the effect of the withdrawal of rulings given by the Secretary and his officials in the discharge of their duties in terms of the Sales Tax Act.</p>
                        <p>The Sales Tax Act has been in operation for just over 11 months. During that period officials had to furnish taxpayers with guidance over a wide spectrum of matters. In some cases it was possible to deal with problems affecting particular concerns by means of consultation with the organization representing those concerns. Normally rulings are given at the request of individual taxpayers and various organizations, and my department does so gladly, because it is of the utmost importance that the taxpayer should have certainty as to the sales tax implications of his transaction. It is also important that rulings be given as quickly as possible in order to prevent the disruption of business. Naturally it is important that the taxpayer should be able to rely on departmental rulings, and for the department it is important that such rulings be complied with. In an imperfect world it is possible that mistakes may creep in in the interpretation of the Act by various persons or that, in the light of subsequent experience, a ruling may appear to be out of step or unsatisfactory and be withdrawn. The opinion is held that the withdrawal of a ruling ought not to have a retrospective effect. From the taxpayer&#x2019;s point of view, he should not be asked to pay additional tax on past transactions. From the department&#x2019;s point of view, tax which was paid in terms of an accepted ruling need not be repaid.</p>
                        <p>With the objects of certainty and finality in mind, three amendments are being proposed by the Bill in clauses 2, 12 and 13.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want now to proceed with my Second Reading speech on this Bill.</p>
                        <p>Clause 2 deals with decisions given by the Secretary to any person&#x2014;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(a) to the effect that such person is either required or not required to register as a vendor; or</li>
                            <li>(b) as to the nature of a transaction concluded by such person.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Where the decision is subsequently withdrawn, it shall not retrospectively affect the liability or non-liability of such person for the payment of tax payable or not payable in consequence of such decision. The proposed new provision will only be applicable if the decision was accepted by the person concerned and all the material facts were known when the decision was given.</p>
                        <p>Clause 12 inserts a new section 26A into the Act which places a restriction on the powers of the Secretary to recover tax retrospectively in the case where he gave a general ruling to the effect that tax was not payable, and subsequently withdrew that ruling. The difference between clauses 2 and 12 is simply that clause 2 deals with particular decisions, while clause 12 deals with general rulings.</p>
                        <p>Clause 13(b) which amends section 32 of the principal Act, is in certain respects the opposite of clause 12, since it places a restriction on the right of a taxpayer to claim a refund of sales tax where such claim was made more than three months after the transaction or events in terms of which the tax became payable.</p>
                        <p>If the tax was paid in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time of the payment, no refund may be made. A refund of an amount overpaid as a result of a miscalculation or an accounting or factual error is not being excluded however and the time limit for refunds in such cases remains two years. The opinion is held that the period of three months affords the taxpayer sufficient opportunity to claim a refund as a matter of principle, in contrast to a mere error of a mechanical nature.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, I would now like to deal with a few random matters. I am pleased to be able to say that the inevitable teething problems encountered when the tax was introduced were not such as to cause any radical change in the basic principles originally followed. Traders readily understood how to apply the add-on and add-in systems of tax recovery. Unfortunately, some vendors have been slack about displaying the appropriate notices at entrances to business premises and at points where payments are made. These notices are there to protect the public and it is proposed in clause 6(d) of the Bill, amending section 10 of the Act, to make the failure to display the notice an offence. Certain other similar offences of a technical nature are also created by the same clause. Another offence is created by clause 18 of the Bill, amending section 43 of the Act, which will be committed if a seller knowingly and without lawful excuse includes in or adds on to the price or amount charged to a purchaser an amount of tax in excess of the tax properly chargeable. This is actually an extension of an existing offence, that is, charging tax when no tax is chargeable.</p>
                        <p>The tax, as hon. Senators are aware, is an indirect tax in that it is normally payable by one person (the seller) and recovered by him from another person (the purchaser or enduser). Usually, with a tax such as the sales tax, the fiscus is primarily concerned with the person who is responsible for paying the tax (the seller), leaving it to the parties to arrange how the seller is to recover the tax from the purchaser. This is an acceptable approach in most cases, particularly where the purchaser is in fact the end-user and the parties have a direct contractual relationship. In some cases, for example, in the building industry, one finds that a subcontractor (e.g. an installer of lifts) is liable for the payment of sales tax on his subcontract. The subcontractor recovers the tax from the main contractor and the main contractor recovers from the ultimate employer; that is, the person who has a building erected. The subcontractor cannot as a rule recover the tax directly from the employer. If payment by the employer to the main contractor or by the main contractor to the subcontractor is delayed unduly, the subcontractor may be embarrassed by having to finance the payment of the tax some time before he has received it. The department has discussed these problems exhaustively with the persons concerned and although further difficulties are not anticipated, it is deemed advisable to give the Secretary a discretionary right to recover the tax directly from an intermediate party or from an end-consumer when the person from whom tax is recoverable by another person has refused to pay or has not paid the amount in question when it fell due, so resulting in a delay in payment of the tax to the Secretary or in embarrassment to the person liable to pay the tax to the Secretary. Cases of this nature will be exceptional and the proposed provisions are to apply where the person from whom the tax is recoverable disputes or does not acknowledge the right of the other party to recover the tax. The Secretary&#x2019;s right to assess and recover the tax is provided for in the new subsection (13) added to section 10 of the Act by clause 6(b) of the Bill. It is not felt that there will be any necessity to proceed under the new subsection (13) merely because a vendor has difficulty in recovering amounts owing to him by a customer under an ordinary contract as it is to be expected that parties will make due provision for the tax and, where payment of amounts due under a contract of sale is delayed, the selling vendor is entitled to relief in the form of a debtor&#x2019;s allowance. Hon. Senators are referred to paragraph 17 of the introduction to the explanatory memorandum in which reference is made to certain other administrative provisions of the Bill.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen that many of the provisions of the Bill concern various kinds of enterprises. An effort has been made to provide for the trouble-free functioning of the Act in the case of each kind of enterprise, with due regard to the problems of enterprises in that category. Anomalies have, as far as possible, been removed and lists of tax-free inputs allowable to various categories of enterprises have been expanded or clarified. The explanatory memorandum deals fairly fully with the various changes proposed. I might add that all representations received by the department are carefully considered. A request for the granting of any additional tax-free input to any kind of enterprise normally has to be tested by inquiring how the endconsumer is affected. For instance, it is relevant to ask how much tax the endconsumer indirectly bears in respect of the taxable inputs of a manufacturer (as a hidden element of the price) in addition to the 4% he bears on the price of the manufactured goods. An undue escalation is unacceptable but a negligible escalation can, in view of the low rate of the tax, be ignored. Research is undertaken on a continuous basis and changes in the price structure may well result in changes to Schedule 2 to the Act in future. It is not pretended that a state of perfection has arrived, as new problems are continually arising and, of course, amendments will have to be made from time to time.</p>
                        <p>As is the case in all taxes one must always guard against the whittling away of the tax base by constant exclusions, exemptions and exceptions which might relieve the burden on a particular category of transactions but pass it on to another category. We have in the recent past seen newspaper reports of quite a sharp hike in the value-added tax-rate (VAT) in the United Kingdom from 8&#x00BD;% to 15%. This may be partly due to the need for more tax from this source to counteract the relief given in direct taxes but the high level of VAT can, in my view, also be attributed to the fact that vast areas of sales are zero-rated, thus narrowing the base of the charge.</p>
                        <p>An important amendment contained in clause 1(d) of the Bill will be found in paragraph (b) of the definition of &#x201C;exported&#x201D;. This provision refers to the case where registrable goods (usually motor-cars, caravans, boats, etc.) are sold under a sale concluded on or after the promulgation of the Sales Tax Amendment Act, 1979, and delivered by the seller to any person in the Republic for conveyance to that person&#x2019;s address outside the Republic. If the relevant law governing registration of such registrable goods does not require that in consequence of the change of ownership occasioned by the sale the goods be registered in the Republic, then no sales tax will be levied in the Republic in respect of the goods.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, therefore, under the new provisions a non-resident of the Republic will be permitted to buy a motor vehicle in the Republic and drive it across the border under a temporary permit (pending registration in another country), and no sales tax will be payable by him in the Republic in respect of the sale. It must be mentioned here that if the purchaser ordinarily resides in a country which levies a sales tax on imported goods (e.g. South West Africa), he may have to pay sales tax in the other country on the value of the motor vehicle which he imports into that country, but that tax would then be payable in terms of the law of the country in which he resides.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to touch on a a general impression that seems to crop up in the most unlikely places&#x2014;that one can without much effort add a further half or one per cent or more to the tax rate to cover the cost of this, that or the other pet scheme. After all, so the argument runs, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s another percentage point on such a low rate?&#x201D; Let me sound a timeous note of caution. Indirect taxes must be used with the utmost circumspection as they are applied across the board on all consumption expenditure of people from all walks of life, and a one per cent increase represents a 25% rise in the tax rate. It would be foolish to think that in this changing world anything can remain static but I am optimistic that, with a growing economy, a jealous husbandary of our tax resources and greater efficiency of administration as experience is gained, we will be able to improve the yield from this source without necessarily having to increase the tax rate. To achieve this, we must guard against the temptation of seeing the general sales tax as a convenient vehicle for an undisciplined gathering of funds.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. the Deputy Minister was quite correct in his concluding remarks on this legislation. He gave us a figure tonight of R654 million that was collected by way of sales tax during the months in which this Act was in force, viz. from 1 July to 31 March. In his concluding remarks he said that there would be an increase in the amount which would be collected by way of this tax. If one looks at the revenue estimates for the present financial year one sees that under the heading &#x201C;general sales tax&#x201D; there is an amount of R1 150 million which is a considerable increase. It is not double the amount but it is very nearly double the amount collected during the previous tax year. One must admit that that amount was collected over a period of ten months and that two months have been left out of the reckoning because we had a so-called holiday from the general sales tax.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Was it nine months? All right then. The fact about sales tax is that it is something which feeds on itself. That cannot be helped. The hon. the Minister of Finance referred to this in his budget speech when he said that because of certain factors we had an unsatisfactorily high cost-of-living figure in South Africa. Among those factors he mentioned the introduction of sales tax. If the cost of living rises and if prices rise over a wide front then the sales tax increases on the 4% basis or whatever basis one might determine. That is why I say it is something which feeds on itself. It is therefore not strange that larger amounts will be collected in future by way of this tax. If prices rise and taxes increase, it follows that people will demand higher wages because they cannot come out on their money. In this way more sales tax is collected and so it goes on.</p>
                        <p>We on this side of the House were always in favour of sales tax. We knew that this new tax which first became effective last year would experience some growing pains. That is why we expected that there would be a considerable number of amendments this year to the Sales Tax Act. As the hon. the Deputy Minister has so rightly said, as we learn from experience in future, there will be still further amendments to the Act to adjust to the practical circumstances of our economic life.</p>
                        <p>We welcome the fact that there has been a certain amount of adjustment as is evidenced in this Bill. But one thing we in the Opposition can never approve is the fact that certain staple foods which are essential for the lower income groups and the unemployed are also subject to this tax. There are also other basic necessities but let us confine ourselves for the moment to food. This is the one commodity which has consistently risen in price this year because of the fact that the farmers could not have come out if increased price adjustments had not been made in respect of their products. As a result of the increased price adjustments, the price paid for a unit of anything in the line of food increases because the sales tax of 4% is more on a higher price than on a lower price. That is why we have appealed here for differentiation, Sir. The reply we got to our pleas was that we cannot have differentiation because where would it end once it was started. That is the reply we got. But that reply does not satisfy this side of the House. In terms of the old sales duty there was differentiation and it made no difference.</p>
                        <p>There are only two ways of helping the lower paid section of the population to bear the burden, viz. either by applying differentiation in this case or paying higher subsidies to the consumer to enable him to buy the basic foodstuffs he needs.</p>

                        <p>Yes, we have the cheapest food in the world. The hon. Senator has helped me and I am very grateful to him. We have the cheapest food if we compare our prices with overseas prices but that is just how that hon. Senator argues and that is why he is sitting on the Nat side of the House. He is a person who has travelled extensively overseas. I want to ask him how wages overseas compare with wages in South Africa. I also want to put this question to him, and he must answer it: What social services does a person overseas get in return for the payment of tax; in other words, for the money he puts into the Treasury, compared with what the taxpayer in South Africa receives? He must not use that ridiculous sort of argument with me, Sir. Let him go and speak to the pensioners and the people who have to exist on a fixed income. Let him go and talk to the unemployed and tell them: You have the cheapest food in the world. Those are the people who do not have the money to pay for that food. He can argue the case with them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I want to tell the hon. Senator that one should not be so quick to make comparisons as he has just tried to do. I know what the results of cheap food in South Africa are. I know what the results of this have been as far as the depopulation of the platteland in South Africa is concerned. If he approves of that sort of thing he is free to do so. He is a leader in the agricultural industry and occupies a responsible position. If he wants to advance this sort of argument he is free to do so. But I want to warn him that we will experience a social revolution in South Africa if we do not do something quickly and soon about food prices, and particularly staple food prices.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, to come back to the Bill, this is the sort of objection we had to the Bill in its original form. Regarding the influence of the Bill on tax reforms and all that sort of thing, we have no objection. We in South Africa are seeking a lower tax rate to bring about greater investment and greater saving, especially among the higher income groups. People who have reached a higher level of productivity should in my view work longer periods in the year and take shorter holidays because the taxes will not worry them. At the same time we are seeking a system which is balanced, a system which will ensure that the poor and lower paid sections of our population will also be able to afford the necessities of life in a country which, as we so often hear, is flowing with milk and honey. It is no good its being a land of milk and honey for one group while for the other groups it is &#x201C;the wet van Transvaal&#x2014;bars en betaal&#x201D;. And in most cases it is &#x201C;bars&#x201D;, Sir.</p>

                        <p>If one projects it over 12 months the anticipated increase is 18%. If the hon. Senator Swanepoel had done his homework, he would have realized that we are speaking about 18% and not 100%. However, even that can be ascribed to some things that are looked upon as economic indicators in South Africa, for instance increased employment greater numbers of people being employed, greater spending power, etc. These are some of the things that will contribute towards that extra income. And actually it is a compliment when one realizes that the economy of the country is such that by normal processes, without increasing the percentage of sales tax, we are in fact netting more revenue. That is an indication that in fact the economy is improving.</p>
                        <p>It is not a question of how much you earn but of how much you are spending. If people are spending money, it means that they are spending it because they have the money to spend and because the economy is enabling them to do so.

                        <p>I wanted to say quite a lot about the general sales tax but because of the time factor the hon. the Deputy Minister must please accept as said the many complimentary things one can say about the general sales tax and which should be said. I can only wish him well as time does not allow me to say them.</p>
                        <p>With regard to liquid petroleum gas, the sales tax gives rise to a price increase which becomes prohibitive in some cases. Instead of using gas people are forced to make use of other sources of energy. Electricity is not taxed and there are three cities in South Africa where the supply of gas is also not taxed. As the law stands at the moment, if gas is supplied by means of a pipeline such as in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, it is not taxed, but if the gas is delivered in a cylinder it is taxed. Restaurateurs and hoteliers who supply us with our meals from day to day are buying gas which is taxed and that tax is added to the price of the meal. Conservatively speaking, if a man uses gas to prepare a meal over a period of half an hour, that meal, at the cost of liquid petroleum gas today, will cost 2c more because of sales tax alone. This is an inflationary tendency. If it was only that, I would be content, but let us look at the anomaly of what happened in Grahamstown. Grahamstown was the fourth city which also supplied gas by way of a pipeline so who bought that gas did not pay tax. Then the contractors discovered that that pipeline was leaking so badly that what they put into the pipeline did not come out on the other side. So what did they do? They changed over to cylinder gas and started delivering gas. Now the consumer, instead of having tax-free gas, has to pay tax. This is an anomaly. When I go further and explain to the hon. the Deputy Minister that within a period of five years we are going to have an oversupply of that very important fuel &#x2026; in this country to the extent of between 23 and 40 million tons, on a worldwide basis, I think I am beginning to indicate to him why I believe that it is necessary for us as a Government to start looking at the healthy propagation of this very important alternative fuel to petrol. I wish to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister in tee short time which I am devoting to this very important subject to take cognizance of the fact that there is this very important alternative energy source, namely liquid petroleum gas, which at the moment represents only 9% of the energy resources we are using but which by projection will have to grow to something like 20% over the next 15 years. This indicates what an important source of energy liquid petroleum gas is to us on a worldwide basis. We in South Africa are going to produce that gas on a very extensive scale with the introduction of Sasol II. It is already a by-product of every refinery in South Africa. Whether they want to or not, they have to produce liquid petroleum gas. I want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister, if he can see his way clear at some time or another, to leave an opening somewhere to ensure that proper attention is given to this aspect over the next three or four months while Parliament is in recess. I am sure that with the kind of motivation I have advanced he will find sufficient reason to treat this appeal with kindness.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, in spite of the fact that there is apparently no further response from the Opposition in regard to this measure, I should like to take this opportunity of saying something on this subject I should also like to refer to the speech which the hon. Senator Swanepoel made.</p>
                        <p>Senator Swanepoel often makes very good speeches here on which we on this side of the House compliment him. But I am afraid that sometimes he gets a bit worked up and makes statements which are somewhat suspect I think tonight was one of those occasions and I should like to refer to this briefly.</p>
                        <p>In the first place the hon. Senator Swanepoel said that his party had always been in favour of general sales tax. I want to ask the hon. Senator now if at the time of the introduction of this tax he and his party voted in favour of it.</p>

                        <p>Tonight the hon. Senator Swanepoel advanced the same argument, namely that they were in favour of general sales tax but that essential goods should be excluded. That is the same argument which was used in the Other Place. But I have a problem here with the hon. Senator Swanepoel. It is the same problem I had with my good friend, the hon. Senator Horak, earlier today when he said in regard to Venda: &#x201C;We are in favour of everything, short of independence.&#x201D; My problem now is how close to real independence we must stop. I am referring to this because it also illustrates my problem with the hon. Senator Swanepoel. I think it would have lent his argument a great deal of force if the hon. Senator could have illustrated the concept of &#x201C;essential goods&#x201D; by quoting examples. I can easily think of half a dozen things which would fall under this but precisely where do we draw the line? Coffee and sugar are of course essential goods. But now I come to something like a television set In our country there is scarcely a house, even among the less privileged people, which has no television set I should like to know from the hon. Senator Swanepoel if he lists a television set in the category of essential goods.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely nothing. What is a staple food? In the Free State it is mealie meal, but with us it is something more. That is my problem. The Opposition say that they want to exclude essential goods and I shall only attach weight to that argument if they tell me precisely what those essential goods comprise. But I leave that matter at that.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel became worked up, even a little upset, when my friend behind me pointed out to him that South Africa has always been one of the cheapest countries in the world.</p>

                        <p>All right, comparably so. I would not put it so strongly but I would say that even taking into account the wage and salary structure in South Africa we have always been one of the cheapest countries in the world. Unfortunately, I do not have the figures with me tonight because I did not think these arguments would crop up but I remember that we read recently in the newspapers&#x2014;not the Afrikaans-medium newspapers but the English-medium newspapers&#x2014;about that well-known old comparison. The hon. Senator Swanepoel is well acquainted with this. It is also referred to as &#x201C;a weekly wage will buy so much&#x201D;. In those terms the hon. Senator Swanepoel cannot deny that South Africa remains one of the cheapest countries. I do not say the cheapest because that is a dangerous statement There might be a small island somewhere which is in fact cheaper but I say we are one of the cheapest countries. And the hon. Senator Swanepoel must not get excited when that statement is made because it is true.</p>

I want to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2014;I have not yet had the opportunity to do so&#x2014;on the promotion he has received, and I also want to tell him that with the couple of Bills he has introduced he has made a very good impression upon the Senate. I want to congratulate him most sincerely. I think he shows great promise for the future. This is a new field for him to a large extent He had, I think, to take up this post at very short notice but he has really acquitted himself of his task as though he were well acquainted with the department and its many functions. It has made a big impression on us on this side of the House.</p>

                        <p>The hon. the Deputy Minister said in his speech that the new tax was a virile one. Mr. President, when the hon. the Deputy Minister speaks of virility then he is in the right place. There is no doubt about that We know all about that and we agree with him that the new tax contains some special features. This has already been shown by the anticipated revenue for the new financial year. I cannot help referring too to the very accurate estimate which was made. It is almost unbelievable that the hon. the Minister together with his senior officials could have been so close to the mark with the anticipated revenue from this new source, particularly when it is a new sphere.</p>
                        <p>This brings me to one special point which I feel I must raise here this evening. We are a young country&#x2014;many probably regard us as a little backward&#x2014;but if we do try something new we do it with great thoroughness. I think now of the introduction of the metric system some years back We did this in such an advantageous and successful way that it served as a model in later years for many other countries. There were very few drawbacks or crises in that regard and the introduction of this sales tax has often reminded me of that Very few drawbacks became apparent in the course of that system. This is proved by the fact that the hon. the Deputy Minister has come here this evening and introduced a Bill which really contains very few amendments. There are essential amendments here and there, but it really proves one important thing, viz. that the officials and the Minister have made a very good job of it.</p>
                        <p>I want to conclude by paying tribute this evening&#x2014;and I am sorry the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot take credit for this because he was not there then&#x2014;to the hon. the Minister and particularly to Mr. Van der Walt and his senior officials. Incidentally, I know how hard they have worked, not only during normal working hours but over week-ends and at night to prepare this sales tax and the Bill which followed for introduction about a year ago. They did their work so well that I think we owe it to them tonight to pay tribute to them and to thank them for their excellent achievement.</p>

                        <p>No, wait, I stuck my neck out when the original legislation was introduced here and I voted with the governing party. I did have the assurance of the hon. the Minister of Finance that this additional revenue would be used for all sorts of purposes, including the improvement of social services and the position of the less privileged people. At that time I made an appeal to the hon. the Minister that before he introduced his budget, this year&#x2019;s budget, he should carefully consider the payment of subsidies on essential foodstuffs. I find it very difficult to understand why the hon. Senator Dempsey does not know what are absolutely essential foodstuffs. What is the position in regard to our Black population? I do not think I am wrong when I say that their essential foodstuffs are mealie meal and mealie meal porridge. They have now also started to eat bread. I admit that in his budget the hon. the Minister of Finance has appropriated an additional amount of R20 million as a subsidy on bread. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister of Finance picked me out the other day because I said only R20 million. I hear the hon. the Minister of Agriculture also mentioning only that figure. I corrected myself and said it was an additional R20 million.</p>
                        <p>I want to say to the hon. Senator of wool fame that one cannot live by bread alone. What must one regard as absolutely essential foodstuffs? Where is the leader of the health group on that side? Can he tell us how much the State is spending at present to eradicate tuberculosis? Nobody knows, Sir.</p>

                        <p>I should like to know, Sir, how this additional revenue will be spent. I say the Government is wasting money because they spend more than R19 million combating tuberculosis while they only spent R7 million in the form of subsidies on dairy products in the past. That account for combating tuberculosis could therefore have been halved. I gained the impression that the hon. the Minister of Finance would carefully consider my suggestion but he did not consider it at all. Why do we have the cheapest food in the world?</p>

                        <p>Sir, I come back to the sales tax. The fact is that the revenue from this tax will be still greater in the coming financial year because the price of food has risen by 15%. You know what the implications of this are, Sir. The figure will be much higher than the estimate of the department of over R1 050 million. I think it is going to be much higher because food prices alone have risen by 15%, something the people are objecting to most strenuously. What is the major problem? The problem does not lie with the Government which introduced the sales tax. Who gets the blame? The farmer of South Africa. No concessions are made in the sales tax system for the farmer of South Africa. A few exceptions are made in regard to fuel, fertilizer etc. but in any case the price of those articles has risen sky high and the concessions really do not amount to much as far as food production costs are concerned. There are so many other things which are essential to the farmer and upon which sales tax is levied. These are all things which send the farmer&#x2019;s capital investment rocketing. What is the position regarding new implements? I bought an implement the other day on which I had to pay sales tax. The ridiculous part is that when I have to buy parts for that implement, those parts are free of sales tax! I am registered as a farmer. I have my registration number. [Interjections.] Would the hon. Senator of 
                            <i>Vader-land</i> fame like to put a question? I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give attention to this matter. I realize the difficulty the Department has in making too many exceptions. But I do feel that the hon. the Minister should look again at the question of sales tax on essential goods, goods which are not only essential in the direct production of food but which call for capital investment Those implements are necessary to enable the 70 000 farmers to produce more food.
                        </p>
                        <p>Take the question of barbed wire and iron posts. In my part of the world we are engaged in a new grazing programme and we need a great deal of barbed wire and iron poles, on which we have to pay 4% tax. As a result the price of red meat has risen sky high, but it is still 25% lower than three years ago. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister and his staff will give attention to this matter. The farmer&#x2019;s capital investment in specific cases should also be exempt from sales tax. A golf club can buy a machine to eradicate weeds but I have a certificate to say I am a farmer &#x2026;</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, if I were to be very specific, the ladies would blush. You know, Sir, I have a young wife! It says a lot that I have a wonderful 18 month old daughter.</p>
                        <p>In a more serious vein I want to say that I appreciate the difficulties of the department in making exceptions in those cases. As I say, a golf club can probably buy a machine for R700 or R800 to eradicate weeds, but they do not have a certificate of exemption while as a farmer I have one. If the hon. the Minister and his staff do not believe me they can always make inquiries to find out what the situation is. I make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider exempting those important items which encourage food production. It is a fact that the farming industry does not have a big profit margin. The farmer gets 6% on his invested capital&#x2014;as the Americans say: &#x201C;2% is in hard cash and only 4% in pleasure.&#x201D; If the hon. the Minister is going to take another 4% we shall find ourselves in difficulty later. The farming industry does not have the wherewithal to build up capital. This is a difficult position and I really do hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister and his staff will give attention to the matter. We do not expect a definite reply tonight but we hope things will be better for us next year.</p>

                        <p>Yes, they also mentioned essential goods. Let us deal with the argument of the hon. Senator Du Toit in regard to basic foods. Once one begins to make exceptions in regard to general sales tax, one finds oneself in difficulties because the first point we must remember is that the dealer who has to levy that tax starts encountering difficulties. He is, as it were, an official of the Department of Inland Revenue. He collects our tax. We expect that man to have the ability to be able to differentiate. Say, for instance, he does not pay tax on bread and mealie meal, but it has to be paid on cake flour. He pays on one but not the other. Apart from placing a heavy burden on the dealer, one is also opening the way to misuse. Now we make it easier for malpractices to occur.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>The chain stores also sell it Now one starts to mark the goods but that man has to be controlled in respect of his total turnover. Now the Receiver of Revenue has to go even further. He must try to determine what quantity of basic foodstuffs has been sold because this man&#x2019;s tax does not look right In the Other Place the argument was advanced that certain persons&#x2019; turnover suddenly declined. This aspect is being looked into but one does not want to complicate this matter further.</p>
                        <p>I want to say further that the Secretary for Inland Revenue was sent overseas and he made a very comprehensive study of the two systems. One system is applied in the United Kingdom, namely, the value added tax. In the United States they also have a form of sales tax. In both countries it is said that when tax is levied on a commodity basis serious problems are encountered. We have just started this system and if one makes it so complicated right from the beginning by bringing in those things, then the whole thing will become too involved. One makes it unnecessarily complicated and creates an opportunity for people to abuse the system.</p>
                        <p>For the sake of the record I should like to say something about basic foods which has been raised by hon. Senators. From time to time emotional pleas are made for the exemption of basic foods from general sales tax. Let me put it this way&#x2014;and I shall prove it&#x2014;that the Government is not unsympathetic in regard to this matter. On the contrary; the Government has a great deal of sympathy for the under-privileged people of this country. Constant attention is given to their needs. We can be judged by our record. Subsidies are built in to the maize price so that the price to the consumer is subsidized because the Government pays for the storage of the maize. Bread is subsidized. We have a national housing scheme in terms of which we look after the interests of the poor man in respect of housing. Hospital fees are paid according to the income of the individual. We have a good record as far as the protection of the interests of the less privileged people in this country is concerned. The hon. Senator Dempsey showed most competently what precisely basic foodstuffs were. Nobody can define them but vague reference is made to bread, maize products, milk, meat, eggs, etc. Some people go further and say fish, cheese and fruit are also basic foods. The argument can be advanced that a child can only live on yoghurt, which will then make that a basic food. In the same way one can take, for instance, milk or cream, and then such a person will say that powdered milk should also be exempt from the tax. When one begins with this sort of thing one makes things very difficult.</p>
                        <p>Another argument which is often raised is the rich/poor situation. The poor people have to pay the 4% sales tax and the rich people also pay only 4%. We must be very careful that we do not talk about this too much in this country. You all know what I mean. We can be honest with one another in this matter. It is a delicate matter. We must not ride that horse because it will throw us.</p>
                        <p>Regarding this question of sales tax which is imposed over the whole spectrum, the point of departure is to bring about a more balanced tax system in South Africa which will be to the good of all sectors. The too-high marginal income tax scales must be reduced to encourage the job-providing entrepreneur to expand and provide employment. On the other hand, this increasing tax will provide the means whereby further training, social and tax benefits will be available to the lower income groups.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, when in South Africa we talk about this rich-poor situation, the impression must not be created that the Government is granting tax concessions to the higher income groups. That is the goose which lays the golden eggs. We live in a free capitalistic country, and we must not kill the entrepreneur in the country because he provides work for the poor. They help the country to grow, they make it big and strong.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>That is just what I say but now we are criticized in some quarters because the poor man has to pay sales tax while the rich man&#x2019;s marginal scales are reduced. Those are dangerous arguments.</p>
                        <p>In the recent budget the threshold for liability for income tax was raised from R1 200 to R1 500 for married persons under 60 years; that is, by 25%, and for persons over 60 years, from R1 900 to R2 500, that is, 31%. For Black people the threshold has also been raised from R360 to R1 200. As the threshold for Black people as well as for Whites has been raised, it is reasonable that sales tax should be paid by all.</p>
                        <p>Sales tax is not a commodity tax but a tax on a transaction by which movable property is obtained by an end user or an end consumer. The collector is the dealer. It is the cashier at the cash point who would have to identify goods if a selective tax were introduced. When a housewife buys her household needs, the cashier would have to distinguish between the taxable and nontaxable goods and do a double cashing-up, so that at the end of the day there would be a distinction between taxable and non-taxable sales. This involves administrative problems thereby entailing further costs for the dealer to a far greater extent than under the present system.</p>
                        <p>Then there is also this question: How is basic food described? Firstly, it must be remembered that the most important staple foodstuff, viz. bread, is subsidized to counter the effect of the sales tax. But supposing bread is exempted from sales tax&#x2014;and there are hundreds of sorts and forms of bread&#x2014; must only that which is defined be identified by the cashier? That is the problem, Sir. There is a large assortment of bread. Some maize products are used for puddings and gourmet foods. Must everything now be exempted?</p>
                        <p>Milk is also found in various forms. All of it is edible, but must all forms like yoghurt, flavoured milk, surrogate milk powder, etc. also be exempted? These are the questions we shall have to answer. Which cuts of meat should be exempted?</p>

                        <p>If only shin were to be exempted, it is certain that 90% of a butcher&#x2019;s turnover would suddenly be shin. That is what would happen, Mr. President.</p>
                        <p>I could go on like this for hours but the basic principle which must be remembered is that as soon as the basis of a tax is lowered the scale has to be increased to realize the same eventual return.</p>
                        <p>I should like hon. Senators to listen to the following. A study by the Bureau of Market Research of Unisa showed that a Black who earned R1 272 a year spent on an average only R275,11 or 20% of his total income on food.</p>

                        <p>A Black who earns R1 272 a year spends R275,11 on food&#x2014;that is according to Unisa&#x2019;s survey; these are not our figures&#x2014;namely, 20% of his total income. What is more important is the fact that only R126,80 relates to those commodities which could be regarded as the so-called basic foods. So about half of that R275 is spent on basic foods. [Interjections.] The hon. Senator must listen to me first and then do his reckoning later.</p>

                    <speech by="#toit">
                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>The hon. the Deputy Minister is talking now of basic foods. What is the definition of basic foods?</p>
                    </speech>
                    <speech by="#deputy-minister">
                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>But the hon. Senator said he knew what it was and there should therefore not be any confusion about it now. He has just told me what the basic foods are. Unisa gave a definition of basic food and mentioned, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, bread, flour, etc. as examples. It is easy to decide for oneself what basic foods entail but as soon as the Receiver has to decide what food has to be taxed and what has not to be taxed, problems arise. As I have already said, only R126,80 is spent on the so-called basic foods and the tax on those foodstuffs will thus be R5,07 a year or 42 cents per month of that person&#x2019;s expenses. Hon. Senators have asked for basic foodstuffs to be exempted from tax. But for a man who earns R1 272 a year it would mean a rebate of 42 cents per month. This person would get a rebate of 42 cents per month but the shopkeeper who sells him a loaf of bread every day and has to keep separate accounts for exempted and taxable goods may have to pay out 80 cents a month because of the extra bookkeeping he will have to do.
                        </p>
                        <p>I want to make an earnest appeal therefore that if one really has the interests of the less privileged people at heart, one should ask for the improvement of their living standards by the payment of a living wage rather than to become emotional about what might be a minute addition to expenses in the form of sales tax. An increase in the administrative costs of the dealer has to be avoided at all costs so that he does not have to raise his prices.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I should like to thank the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter again for the kind thoughts he expressed about me. The hon. Senator spoke about gas which is taxed, i.e. gas sold in cylinders and bottles, and also other gas which is supplied by pipeline and is not taxed.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President clause 4(1)(e) of the Bill amends section 6(1)(d) of the Act and the amendment reads, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;
                        </p>

                        <p>is exempt from sales tax.</p>
                        <p>As far as the sale of electricity or gas is concerned, the exemption is clearly designed to apply only where electricity is sold to consumers by such undertakings as municipal power stations, Escom etc. or, in the case of gas, by undertakings such as municipal gas works.</p>
                        <p>In the case of farming enterprises, that is, where farming or forestry operations are carried on, the exemption from sales tax contained in paragraph 6 of Division IV of Schedule 2 to the Act, refers, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, to gas purchased in bulk supply and intended to be used directly in the production of farming or forestry products.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although the principle of neutrality is observed as far as possible when it comes to manufacturing or production inputs, it is not possible to preserve neutrality as between the sale of electricity and the sale of gas to consumers by providing an exemption in respect of the sale of gas in bottles or cylinders where the gas so purchased is intended to be used for domestic purposes such as cooking, lighting or heating, because gas in bottles or cylinders is usually distributed through retail outlets, that is, over the counter, in the same way as groceries are sold in a grocery store.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances I regret that I cannot accede to the hon. Senator&#x2019;s request but I will ask the Secretary to go into the matter again during the recess. I am also prepared to listen to the hon. Senator if he wants to address me on the question of liquid gas.</p>
                        <p>*Mr. President, I agree with the hon. Senator that we shall have more gas at our disposal in time and therefore we are prepared to reconsider the question of gas as a source of energy.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Dempsey also addressed some kind words to me which I do not deserve but I want to tell him that I appreciate this very much. He gave us a very good explanation of the crux of the problem in regard to so-called basic foodstuffs, i.e. that it is a question of the description. I agree&#x2014;I think we all agree&#x2014;that food prices in South Africa are among the cheapest in the world if one takes everything into account, e.g. salaries, etc. As far as living standards are concerned, it is a fact that circumstances in South Africa are favourable. In terms of the norms and yardsticks which the hon. Senator advanced, e.g. how many hours one has to work for a pair of shoes, it is clear that we must be grateful for the fact that we live in a country like South Africa. I want to associate myself fully with the hon. Senator&#x2019;s words of thanks and congratulation to the Secretary and to the department for the exceptional measure of success they have achieved with the introduction of the general sales tax. During the first year it was such a success that they were only 0,6% out in their estimate of the revenue to be derived from the tax. We want to thank the department for the very good work they have done in this connection.</p>
                        <p>As far as the hon. Senator Du Toit is concerned, I have already partially replied to his request that there should be subsidies on essential foodstuffs. But he made a statement which I would not have made. He may have been in politics longer than I have but I think he made a mistake when he said that we spend too much on tuberculosis and too little by way of a subsidy on milk. I do not think one should put it that way. Does the hon. Senator maintain that we should spend less on the fight against tuberculosis?</p>

                        <p>I am pleased that that is not what the hon. Senator meant but it rather seemed to me as if he did say that. Nevertheless, I want to tell the hon. Senator that I think the Government is doing its duty as far as the fight against tuberculosis is concerned. This is a serious matter and one which should be approached with a large measure of responsibility. I should not like to say more now about the question of combating tuberculosis.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator also mentioned sales tax on new farm implements. Reference was also made in general to farming activities and, because this is a very real problem, I should like to say something tonight about farming purchases and means of production. I shall not take up too much of the time of the House in this respect.</p>
                        <p>One of the most important administrative objectives of the system of general sales tax is to prevent as far as possible a tax on a tax; in other words, that the price and therefore also the tax which the end consumer has to pay is increased significantly as a result of tax which manufacturers and others have to pay on inputs by them in the manufacturing or production process. This means simply that if the input bears tax which results in the price increasing to such an extent that the tax which the end consumer has to pay is significantly higher, we shall have to look at that matter again.</p>
                        <p>Although in many cases it will be difficult for the farmer to pay tax which he has to pay by way of price increases to the consumer and, strictly speaking, there is thus less chance that there will be an escalation in the net amount of tax paid by the consumer in respect of the purchase of farming products, it is nevertheless accepted that increased production costs, as a result of the taxation, could have an adverse effect on food production. Therefore provision has already been made in Section IV of Schedule 2 of the Act that farmers can purchase almost all their means of production tax free. It must be noted that not only the basic input, i.e. seed, fertilizer and cattle feed can be so purchased but also a wide range of other means of production in respect of which it has been decided in consultation with organized agriculture that the use thereof would have a marked effect on production costs. If there are certain items which are not mentioned in the list which might also have such an effect, organized agriculture is at liberty to bring these to the attention of the department and serious attention will certainly be given to the matter. It must however, be emphasized that only those items in respect of which the unit cost would in fact increase the price of a product significantly will be considered. Capital goods like tractors, combines* etc. do not qualify for consideration in this respect. Spread over the period of use of those items as well as the volume of production the tax paid at the time of purchase has only a very minimal effect on the unit costs of the products which it helps to produce.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the Act empowers the Minister of Finance to amend the schedules by way of notice in the 
                            <i>Government Gazette</i> at any time when Parliament is not in session. If it can be shown therefore that any item not in the list of goods which may be purchased tax free should be included, the Minister can immediately take steps in that connection.

                        <p>I must say very clearly and expressly here that we are prepared to listen to such representations which can be substantiated. I think I have replied to all the hon. Senators.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, solely for the purpose of clarity I should like to move amendments to this clause. I refer to clause 4(1)(i) on page 12. I propose here that we accept different wording at the end of the paragraph instead of the amendment contained in the Bill. We referred to the idea of this amendment last year when sales tax became law. The idea was that where someone transferred a business to somebody else and retained certain of the assets for himself, e.g. the building or vehicles or whatever assets he chose to retain, sales tax should only be paid on the assets which he disposed of and not the assets which he retained for himself. As the old Act read it could be interpreted that the purchaser had to pay sales tax on everything, including the buildings and other assets, whether they were retained by the original owner of the business or not What does the clause now try to do? The object of this paragraph is really to exempt the assets retained by the original owner from sales tax. But the wording of the proposed amendments by means of which those retained assets will be exempt from sales tax is such that I have had various representations to word them more clearly. I am not giving my own opinion on this matter; I am relaying the opinion of representations made to me by people who say that as the Bill reads at present it is not clear whether those assets which the original owner or the seller retains for himself should be exempt or included. I find this particularly in so far as the English text is concerned. I therefore wish to move the following amendments&#x2014;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(1) On page 12, in line 54, to omit all the words after &#x201C;thereof&#x2019; up to and including &#x201C;approve)&#x201D; in line 57;</li>
                            <li>(2) on page 12, in line 58, after &#x201C;concern&#x201D;, to insert:</li>
                        </ol>
                        <block name="quote">:Provided that any fixed property or book debt, or any other asset which the Secretary, having regard to the circumstances, may approve, shall be excluded</block>
                        <p>I think if we make that change the position will be much clearer and cause far less confusion than the present amendment proposed in the Bill. It is the same idea. We do not differ with the idea expressed here. It is just a question of wording. According to representations made to me the amendment in the Bill is not clear and people are not sure what is excluded and what is not excluded. Accordingly in pursuance of my earlier representations to the Minister I want to say that in taxation legislation one must be able to so read the Act in such a way that there will be no doubt as to its interpretation. It is pursuant to that I have moved these amendments.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I refer to page 10, the proposed paragraph 4(1)(d)(ii) inserted by clause 4(1)(e) which reads-&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>When one looks at subparagraph (iii) one sees that water from tanks or in vats or drums is included. It so happens that in the agricultural sector the farmer as a registered entrepreneur makes use of gas. Unfortunately, he cannot make use of tanks, etc. but he does make use of large containers. We think of the farm where a welding machine is used which uses gas*. The hon. the Deputy Minister is also a cattle farmer and he knows we also use gas for dehorning animals. Perhaps the smaller containers will not qualify but I wonder if in this case we cannot also say&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>The fact that the assets mentioned are not included in the sale does not disqualify the purchaser from exemption in respect of other movable assets where an undertaking is purchased as a going concern. That is so. I can tell the hon. Senator further that buildings are not goods and are not taxable. The proposed paragraph (j) is an exemption in respect of all the assets which are sold when a business is sold as a going concern. The exclusion of fixed property, etc. simply means that where such property is excluded from the sale of a business, the exemption will not be lost. The hon. Senator&#x2019;s correspondent has misunderstood the extent of the amendment, viz. it is a concession.</p>
                        <p>I want honestly to tell the hon. Senator that he need not worry about this. If the hon. Senator can bring a case to my notice where the Act is being interpreted incorrectly I shall ask the Secretary to go into it. I make that offer to the hon. Senator.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, regarding the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply in regard to the question of gas, I just want to tell him that the farmer is the registered entrepreneur. I do not think there is much merit in the argument that we are making too many exceptions because exceptions are made, even in the case of gas. If the farmer, the entrepreneur, shows his certificate&#x2014;the number appears on the invoice&#x2014;is that not sufficient proof that he wants to use the gas for agricultural purposes? That is why I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister if he did not trust the farmer. There may be farmers who would use that gas for household purposes. I mention this specifically because the farmer is a registered entrepreneur. Exceptions are in fact made so cannot they also be made in the case of this essential means of production?</p>

                        <p>We listen a lot to stories about red meat, Mr. Chairman. I just want to solve this problem. There are two ways of selling gas. One is by way of a cylinder which the person hires; in other words, he pays a deposit on it; he uses the cylinder of a company like Shell or Mobil or one of the other companies. He does not buy the cylinder but he buys the gas which is in it. If the person has an exemption certificate, the gas in that cylinder is free of any tax. If the person buys his own cylinder and goes to a dealer and says &#x201C;Fill my cylinder, please; this is my own cylinder,&#x201D; and it is smaller than 9 kg, e.g. 4 kg, then he must pay tax. The difference is whether the cylinder belongs to one of the big companies or whether it is the property of that person. That is where the difference lies.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, this is a very involved and technical clause and I want to refer to Division IVA. Paragraph (d) deals with the felling of trees. If the hon. Senator on my left here hires people to shear his sheep, he does not pay sales tax on that, and if I get people to fell trees on my farm, that is also free of sales tax. But that is an outdated idea. These days we use tractors and so on to uproot trees, and it has precisely the same end result. Will there also be exemption in this case?</p>
                        <p>In paragraph (n) of Division IIIA all sorts of terms are used where machinery etc. is attached to tractors. In the Afrikaans version the word &#x201C;gereedskap&#x201D; is being omitted and the word &#x201C;implemente&#x201D; inserted. There are all sorts of implements which do different kinds of work. I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister will elaborate somewhat on this point.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, let me reply to the hon. Senator this way: The principle at issue here is that a service performed as a contribution to the production of something is free of tax because that escalates the tax. This also applies too to the shearing of sheep. That is a service which is regarded as a contribution to production in the production of wool. Accordingly no sales tax is payable on that shearing service. If one uses a tractor or something else to fell trees, it is a capital outlay and one pays once on the purchase of that capital asset. The 4% which is paid is of course spread over the lifespan of that implement and the volume of work which the implement performs. It therefore has no significant influence as a contribution to production in that case.</p>
                        <p>As far as attachments to machinery are concerned, I shall ask the Secretary to inform the hon. Senator in writing on this. It is a technical matter.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I rise just to say from this side of the House that I thought this was a really interesting debate. It was interesting in the sense that it showed once again the versatility of hon. Senators on the NP side. In this I include the hon. the Deputy Minister. I do not want to exclude him from such a compliment.</p>
                        <p>I listened with great pleasure this evening to people who did not know what basic necessities were and what staple food was and so on. In all honesty I must say that I find the adaptability of hon. Senators opposite very striking. I have here the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Fiscal and Monetary Policy in South Africa, a report brought out by Dr. Franszen in 1968 which led to the Sales Tax Act of 1969 as we know it today. Sir, do you know what that report says? I just want to read one single recommendation from the conclusion to which this commission came. I quote from paragraph 175&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>Yes. This evening they find it difficult to exclude these matters. They find it quite senseless of this side of the House even to make a proposal like this. Where, says the hon. the Deputy Minister, are you going to begin and where will you end? What does one do in the case of bread? Which sorts should be included and which sorts should be excluded? We have already had this sort of tax and there was differentiation. How did the dealers succeed in differentiating among the various kinds of bread? There was no tax on food. Let us begin with the definition of what these necessities of life are because the hon. Senator Fick wants to know. [Interjections.] These are not my definitions; they were given by a professor and his commission and he can accept them. He accepted them in 1969. [Interjections.] They are food, rent, instalments on homes, insurance, repair and maintenance costs of homes, water, sanitary services, removal of refuse and a number of other items. [Interjections.] We are not asking for the exclusion of things such as light, water, etc. All we ask is a differentiation in regard to our basic and essential foodstuffs. The same NP which introduced the sales duty in 1969 found a way of making all these exceptions but cannot find a way to make a few exceptions now. That really surprises me. It seems to me that the more time that passes the less the NP are in a position to do anything. [Interjections.] We are becoming all the more easy going. You can see that I am too. But I am nonetheless prepared to do something for the poor man, which hon. Senators do not want to do. I think that replies to the argument of my friend the hon. Senator Dempsey.</p>
                        <p>So I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that he must be careful with these old out-dated expressions which we find in economics, such as one-time rises and that sort of thing. He should not use them too freely. A one-time rise in the cost of living is not what sales tax is causing in South Africa. I think I have already tried to indicate this to the hon. Deputy Minister. If there are tariff increases, such as is the case of the Railways or in the case of the Electricity Supply Commission or even of Iscor where there was a rise in the price of steel, then one can speak of a one-time rise. However, as I said at the start of my speech, this tax feeds on itself. A rise in prices brings with it a rise in the revenue from this tax. I was surprised that the hon. Senator Comdt. Poorter, for instance, said that this shows the growth in the economy. The fact that there will be an increase in revenue from sales tax does not necessarily point to growth in the economy. There can only be a rise in the cost of living and that in itself will automatically result in an increase in revenue obtained from this tax.</p>
                        <p>†As a matter of fact, Mr. President, this is what we had last year, namely a situation of stagflation, when there was a small growth rate but the cost-of-living figure was in excess of 11%. That is one of the reasons why there was an increase in the amount of revenue collected by way of the sales tax. Let us, therefore, not bluff ourselves, Sir.</p>
                        <p>*It is not a one-time increase. It carries on and flourishes progressively on its own.</p>

                        <p>Sir, perhaps it is not a tax on tax. I have never said it is a tax on a tax. With respect to the hon. Senator who was a lecturer in economics, the allegation that if it is not a tax on a tax it is a one-time increase, has never in my view been a definition of a one-time increase. This is a tax levied on the end price of a product and if that end price is higher it follows of necessity that the tax will also be higher. That cannot be a one-time increase. The hon. Senator wants to ask a question.</p>

                        <p>Will the hon. Senator concede that parallel to the increase in inflation there is also an increase in wages and salaries to compensate for that increase?</p>

                        <p>I am pleased the hon. Senator has substantiated my argument. What he is really saying now is precisely what I said in my speech during the Second Reading debate, viz. that an increase in the cost of living results in an increase in wages and salaries, and the bigger salaries and wages become, the more people have to spend on these more expensive commodities and the larger is the revenue from sales tax. This proves my point precisely&#x2014;that it is not a one-time increase.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I want to say something about the point mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister, viz. the question of the rich/ poor set-up in South Africa. The hon. the Minister said we should not exploit this question or raise it in speeches too often because we are touching on sensitive matters when we do so, that is, if I understood him aright. I am pleased that he is aware of the sensitivity of this situation. The hon. the Deputy Minister said, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, that we should pay the workers a living wage but now I want to suggest to him that we should not by means of measures taken in this House emphasize that rich/poor situation in South Africa, for instance, by levying sales tax which the rich man can afford but the poor man cannot, because we are then bringing this matter to the attention of those very people we do not want to give attention to it.

                        <p>Yes, they know it. The hon. the Deputy Minister suggests that we should rather pay the workers a living wage.

We were also told: &#x201C;You capitalists pay living wages to your workers; make a start on that.&#x201D; Mr. President, I want to draw the following point expressly to the attention of the hon. Deputy Minister because it is very important. It will not help paying the workers in South Africa a living wage, at whatever level we might choose to do it, if their productivity does not justify that wage. It will be of no avail; we can forget it. By doing that we will merely be pushing up the cost of living further and we will solve no problems. [Interjections.]</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Groenewald seems to be very irritated, but I do like irritating people like him in this sort of debate. It is proof that what we have to say on this side of the House does in fact cause a little irritation. Before he becomes even more upset, Sir, I shall resume my seat and tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that we shall support the Third Reading.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I shall not speak for long, but I do think the hon. the Deputy Minister and I are talking at cross-purposes. I fully agree with him that we should not stress this matter of the rich and the poor too much. We now have a definition of essential food and in cases where food is subsidized the rich and the poor enjoy the same benefit. When the hon. the Minister of Finance introduced the original Bill he assured me that he would use some of the additional revue for that very purpose. Perhaps all the other suggestions I have made have helped to reduce the production costs of items on which, for instance, we cannot have exemption from sales tax or have a subsidy. How is the hon. the Deputy Minister going to subsidize meat? That is impossible; we all know that He is a cattle farmer and he should know it as well. But if he were to help reduce the production costs of those items everybody would benefit. I do hope therefore that we have not been talking at cross-purposes.</p>
                        <p>As far as combating tuberculosis is concerned, I want to say clearly to the hon. the Deputy Minister that I did not have that in mind and I did not say it either. I just said that our people should eat more of those foodstuffs which prevent tuberculosis. In Britain doctors have suggested that milk from a cow suffering from tuberculosis should be given to a young child rather than no milk at all because by drinking that milk the child will build up a resistance to tuberculosis. That is all I said. If at this stage we could make that food available to everybody as quickly as possible, the account for combating tuberculosis would be much lower in future.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I shall only be three minutes. The argument that we should exempt certain so-called basic foodstuffs from sales tax is really aimed at helping the under-privileged. But I showed expressly this evening in the example I quoted of the person who earned R1 272 that such an exemption would mean a rebate of only 42 cents a month for him. In the meantime we have also raised the tax threshhold for Black people from R360 to R1 201 a year. In addition, Sir, we have also abolished the capitation tax for Black people.</p>

                        <p>I shall come to the Whites now. The income tax and capitation tax concessions amount to more&#x2014;I want to stress this&#x2014;than that 42 cents which the exemption of sales tax on those so-called basic foodstuffs would entail. [Interjections.] Yes, that was the crux of the hon. Senator&#x2019;s argument. We introduced a sales tax but at the same time we made concessions in respect of tax liability. That is the crux of the matter, Sir. As I have already said, the starting level of tax liability has also been raised in the case of Whites&#x2014;I have already given the percentage&#x2014;and those tax concessions are in fact more than sufficient compensation for the sales tax paid on basic foods. So there is no substance in the argument that basic foods should be exempt from sales tax.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I should also like to stress another point. If a valid argument can be advanced that sales tax on investments in the production process results in the end consumer having to pay a considerably higher tax, such arguments can be submitted to my department and we will consider each one on its merits in order to prevent sales tax contributing to a significant escalation of the tax on the end price of a product.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>The University of Pretoria has deemed it desirable that its principal Act be amended (a) to provide for university activities outside the seat of the university; (b) to provide for a change in the composition of the senate of the university; (c) to provide for the affiliation of or co-operation with any institution or part thereof which has as its object the carrying on of any branch of higher education; (d) to provide for the organization of any portion of the university into schools, colleges or institutions of the university and for the setting up of governing bodies therefor; and (e) to effect certain consequential amendments.</p>
                        <p>Section 2 of the principal Act is being amended to provide for university activities outside the seat of the university. In the faculties of Medicine and Dentistry, training functions are performed at hospitals situated beyond the boundaries of the seat of the university. This affects medical students at undergraduate and post-graduate level and dental students at the undergraduate level. Provision is also being made in this connection for nursing students. Hence the reference to the S.A. Medical and Dental Council as well as to the Nursing Council. It is also being made possible for university activities to be carried on at a college or institution which is situated outside Pretoria and which is affiliated to the university.</p>
                        <p>Section 8 of the principal Act is being amended to provide for a change in the composition of the senate of the university.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, allow me to motivate this. Firstly, in terms of section 1(a)(iii) of the National Education Policy Act, Act No. 39 of 1967, the training of teachers for primary and pre-primary schools at a college and at a university will be closely co-ordinated as from a date to be determined by the Minister of National Education.</p>
                        <p>The University of Pretoria and the Transvaal Provincial Administration have already agreed on the means, methods and terms according to which this co-operation will take place. In view of this co-operation between the university on the one hand and the Pretoria College of Education and the Transvaal Education Department on the other hand, the parties concerned have deemed it advisable that a member of the Pretoria College of Education&#x2014;and if there are more colleges of education in Pretoria at a later stage, a member of each such college of education&#x2014;should also be a member of the senate of the university. In terms of this agreement between the university and the Transvaal Provincial Administration, the university will be represented on the council and in the senate of the Pretoria College of Education.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, since section 1(a) of the National Education Policy Act, 1967, also provides for the training of teachers by the university in co-operation with a technikon, it is deemed advisable, with a view to a possible future agreement about some form of training between the university and such technikon, also to provide for a member of such a college to be a member of the senate of the university.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is proposed that section 29 of the Universities Act be amended to enable any institution or part thereof which has as its object the carrying on of any branch of higher education to affiliate with a university. If this happens with regard to the training of pharmacists at the Pretoria Technikon, for example, it will also be desirable for a member of the staff of such a technikon to be a member of the senate of the university.</p>
                        <p>Section 29 is being amended to provide for the affiliation of or co-operation with any institution or part thereof which has as its object the carrying on of any branch of higher education. The primary reason for this is that the possibility of the training of pharmacists by technikons in co-operation with universities, especially universities with medical faculties, was considered by the University Advisory Council and the Committee of University Principals at the request of the Minister of National Education. Such co-operation will involve more intensive academic training and not an expansion of facilities.</p>
                        <p>The South African Pharmacy Board, too, has already expressed its support for graduate training for pharmacists. Co-operation between the university and the Pretoria Technikon will have to be based on section 29 of the Universities Act. However, this section only provides for the affiliation of the university college to the university. The proposed amendment of section 29 will make it possible for a part of the training given by the technikon, such as the training of pharmacists, to be linked with the university.</p>
                        <p>Section 4 is being inserted to provide for the organization of any portion of the university into schools, colleges or institutions of the university and for setting up governing bodies therefor. This new section, which already occurs in several other university Acts, is being inserted with a view to future university development.</p>
                        <p>Clause 5 is necessary for the purpose of making certain consequential amendments. Because reference is made to a &#x201C;college of education&#x201D; in the proposed paragraph (f) of subsection (1) of section 8, it is necessary to define this term in the Act.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, these amendments will make the University of Pretoria better able to perform its task of instruction, inquiry and education, and to be true to its motto,

                        <p>Pik was years after me. I am speaking now really of Dr. Hilgard Muller and I am speaking of Judge Fritz Steyn and I am speaking of Dr. Anton Rupert and I am speaking of Dr. Frans Cronje and Dr. Freddie van Biljon. All those people where there in my time and they were a brilliant lot of students. I must say that they did wrangle among themselves because there was a fight in progress at the time between the people who supported Nusas&#x2014;as it was in those days, not the sort of degenerate Nusas we find today&#x2014;and the new ASB people. And, of course, no need to guess, Mr. President, the ASB people were Dr. Muller, Dr. Rupert and Fritz Steyn while the Nusas people were Frans Cronjé, Freddie van Biljon and myself. But we wrangled in love and peace and the university progressed and prospered over the years. This Bill, which I fully support, now provides for the development and further growth of the university as well as for this very important relationship between the technikons and the universities. I fully support the Bill and once again congratulate my colleague on its introduction.</p>

Together with the hon. Senator Horak, as an extra-mural student of the University of Pretoria. I thank and felicitate with the hon.

Last night, just after the adjournment, with the intention of playing a trick on my friend the hon. Senator Scholtz, just outside the entrance to the Senate, I let off a bunch of approximately five small fire-crackers that I had found in my briefcase without realizing for the moment that I was committing an offence. I did not intend my action to be contemptuous of the dignity of this House and I should like to record my feelings as being the exact opposite. If any hon.

                        <p>Mr. President, allow me to make a few personal remarks before I begin to deal with the Bill. Firstly, I should like to congratulate you, as an old bench companion of mine in the Other Place, on your promotion to this eminent position in our country. It is a privilege to appear before you in another capacity.</p>
                        <p>As this is the last legislation which I shall deal with on behalf of the Department of Planning, I should like to take this opportunity of conveying my sincere thanks to my colleague, the Deputy Minister, for his support during the months we ran the department and for which we were jointly responsible. I should also like to address a word of thanks to the officials of the department for the dedication with which they perform their duties. Because this department is not often in the limelight, I think it does not always occupy our minds to the extent it should do. The department has an enormous task. The people in the department are inspired and properly qualified and I should like to thank them very much for the opportunity of working with them, even though it was only for a short time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>By the insertion in 1977 of section 49A into the Group Areas Act, No. 36 of 1966, the restrictive provisions of this Act with regard to the acquisition, possession and alienation of immovable property and occupation or utilization of land, buildings or premises were repealed in areas situated outside group areas and that have been zoned for industrial purposes in terms of any town planning scheme which is in operation or binding under any law. The object of this amendment was to make zoned industrial premises available freely and without authorization by permit to the other national groups as well for utilization for industrial purposes. In this regard I want to mention that it has been the policy in recent years not to include industrial areas in group areas, and where it did happen in the past, steps are being taken, where possible, to deproclaim industrial areas that are not an integral part of a group area and to leave them controlled so that the various population groups may practise industrial activities there.</p>
                        <p>Since section 49A was included in the Act, it has come to light that there are certain areas, in Johannesburg for example, that were zoned in terms of the town planning scheme as &#x201C;general&#x201D;, which zoning includes different uses, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, industrial. The general zoning is a comprehensive one.
                        </p>
                        <p>As a result of a civil action, a verdict was returned in the Witwatersrand Division of the Supreme Court in terms of which it was held that the exemption contained in section 49A of the Act, to which I have referred, also applies in respect of any land outside group areas where the zoning, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, allows industrial uses. General zoning also allows industrial use. This verdict implies that a member of any national group may acquire a property zoned as &#x201C;general&#x201D; without authorization by permit and may use&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;and occupy it for purposes permissible in terms of this zoning, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, for residential purposes. Of course, a similar situation could arise in other towns and cities.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. President, this state of affairs is contrary to Government policy, and in all fairness it was never the intention when section 49A was inserted to make provision for these situations in the Group Areas Act. To eliminate this anomaly or contradiction and to achieve the initially intended objectives or scope we wanted to achieve in 1977 through section 49A, and to nullify the interpretation placed on it by the judge, in other words, to close the gap, the legislation we are now considering has become necessary.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I want to thank the hon. the Minister for the explanation he has given us in regard to what I would call this one-clause Bill. We on this side of the House were naturally pleased when that amendment was effected in 1977 because we regarded it as a forward step. I think this is a step which will be approved of by everyone. There was a need for those privileges and naturally they were utilized. I am informed that unfor tunately many of those industrial sites were of such a nature that the buildings did not accommodate commercial undertakings only but that people lived there as well. Apparently that is the aspect that is causing concern. I do not want to say much about this, Sir, but once again I want to express my disappointment that it has become necessary to move an amendment. During the Committee Stage I shall move an amendment in terms of which the right to live on such premises will specifically be excluded. In the meantime I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister could give us an idea of the number of people involved, i.e. whether many people or only a few are involved because that may influence one&#x2019;s attitude.</p>
                        <p>Am I correct in thinking that the 1977 amendment provided that those sites were not intended for industrial purposes only but for trading purposes as well?</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I thank the hon. Senator for supporting the legislation in principle. I just want to explain briefly that the 1977 amendment referred to open industrial areas only. The objective was to give the various population groups the opportunity of sharing in the industrial activities of the country in industrial areas situated outside proclaimed group areas. That is one of the important elements that we want to bring into play to create more equal opportunities for the various population groups so that they too can share in the industrial activities of the country.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately it cannot be amended in this Bill. I shall listen to the hon. Senator just now. I merely want to explain that all this Bill envisages is to achieve the objective which we all agreed upon when the 1977 Act was passed. I want to ask the hon. Senator, therefore, whether he would not be prepared to accept my 
                            <i>bona fides</i> in this connection. Do not let us use this Bill as a means of legalizing practices other than those we intended to legalize in 1977. Legislation will be introduced that will cover the other circumstances to which the hon. Senator has referred but that legislation will be more comprehensive. It will not include trading rights only but will also cover professional people who will require office accommodation in centrally situated trading districts. But a specific procedure is laid down as to when that can happen. I ask therefore that we do not anticipate it because legislation will be introduced in that regard and when that happens we shall be able to have a more meaningful debate on the subject.

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry if I perhaps created the wrong impression during the Second Reading debate. In his reply to the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister convinced me, however, that we should not insist on an amendment at this stage because of the promise he had made. For that reason I asked specifically for this matter to be discussed in Committee. In spite of the fact that those areas were set aside for industrial purposes only, it has been customary for small commercial undertakings to be established there. I am not saying that that was legal but we wanted provision to be made for this. In view of the fact that the hon. the Minister has now given the assurance that legislation in that connection will be introduced&#x2014;I hope it will be soon&#x2014;as a result of the recommendations contained in the Riekert report, we shall not move an amendment.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to the hon. Senator for the reasonable attitude he has adopted but I do not want there to be any misunderstanding. The recommendation contained in the Riekert report which the Government has accepted contains the principle that there can also be centrally situated business areas which the various population groups will have the right to use and to occupy. But the commission also recommended that a specific procedure should be followed. This will not come about summarily and without any further ado. When legislation is introduced to give effect to the decision of the Government we shall have an opportunity of discussing the matter to which the hon. Senator has referred.</p>

                        <p>In this wonderful spirit of co-operation which is prevailing in the House I shall try to be as brief as possible in my motivation of the legislation. According to a legal opinion obtained, with which the State law advisers agree, section 1(3) of the Protection of Businesses Act, 1978, only grants protection to businesses&#x2014;and this is the important word&#x2014;which are the producers of matter or material, or businesses acting on behalf of producers. Certain South African businesses have, in absentia, been accused in the United States of America of having been parties to an agreement which sought to increase the price of certain commodities of a strategic nature by collusion with regard to price determination, allocation, division, limitation of supply and the elimination of competition in regard to commodities and boycotts against certain purchasers of specific goods. Some of the businesses found guilty in absentia in the United States of America are not the producers of the commodities at issue in the court case, nor did they act on behalf of producers. Consequently it would have been possible to apply for a court order in South Africa to impose the American sentence on the businesses concerned in South Africa. The imposition of the American sentences in the cases in question is not considered to be in the interests of South Africa. For this reason it became necessary to amend section 1(3) of the Act to afford the necessary protection to the businesses in question.</p>
                        <p>Here we are once again dealing with a measure aimed at protecting South Africa and its interests against the onslaught being made on us from so many quarters. I therefore trust that as in previous cases, when I came to Parliament during the session with other measures of this nature, I will get the support of both sides of this hon. House for the measure.</p>

                        <p>I know hon. Senators will co-operate with me in piloting this legislation through the House.</p>
                        <p>The Bill contains three amendments. In the first place it inserts four new sections in the Act with a view to establishing the status of companies operating in states that formed part of the Republic prior to their independence.</p>
                        <p>†The first of the proposed new sections will empower the responsible Minister to designate for purposes of the proposed legislation any neighbouring country with the Government of which the Government of the Republic has an agreement relating to the registration in that neighbouring country of certain South African companies. It follows that the designation of any particular country as a neighbouring country for purposes of the proposed legislation will necessarily have to coincide with the commencement of legislation of that country relating to the registration of South African companies.</p>
                        <p>The second of the proposed new sections provides that the provisions of the further two new sections shall, in accordance with the provisions of any agreement between the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the government of a designated neighbouring country pertaining to South African companies deemed to be incorporated or registered in the neighbouring country, apply to such companies. The provisions of the section will recognize the significance of an agreement between the Government of the Republic and the government of any country designated for purposes of the proposed legislation and, at the same time, limit the application of the proposed legislation to the companies in respect of which it should apply.</p>
                        <p>The proposed third new section makes provision for the procedures which have to be followed when any particular South African company is registered in a neighbouring country designated for purposes of the proposed legislation.</p>
                        <p>The proposed fourth new section contains certain provisos in respect of the application of the provisions of the first three of those sections.</p>
                        <p>In the second place an amendment is suggested to the chapter of the Act which makes provision for inquiry into the membership, ownership and control of a company. Under the existing provisions of the Act, any company is obliged to keep a register of its members. Such provisions have been in operation for more than a century. Among others, it has been suggested that the purpose of the register of members of a company is to enable the public to find out who controls the business in which they contemplate investing or to which they may be granting credit. However, the Companies Act, 1973, specifically provides that no company shall be bound to see to the execution of any trust relating to a share, whether express, implied or constructive. It is claimed that this provision is an indication that the legislature is aware of the fact that a registered shareholder might not be the person beneficially interested in the shares registered in his name.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the purpose of the provision may be it would seem that it has given impetus to the practice whereby persons who acquire shares of a particular company and who do not wish to have their names entered in the register of members of that particular company make use of nominees. The question arises whether beneficial ownership of shares should be disclosed. The principal grounds upon which it is claimed that beneficial ownership of shares should be disclosed are, firstly, that the public should be aware of the identity of those persons who are in control of important industries in the country. In the absence of such knowledge important industries might come into the hands of persons who could use their power to the detriment of the country. Secondly, it is contended that any unscrupulous person may find it easier to make illegitimate use of inside information if he can conceal his dealings under the cloak of a nominee. Such dealings do take place despite the fact that they are presently prohibited by the Act Finally, it is said that information as to the beneficial ownership of shares would be useful to a shareholder who wishes to consult his fellow shareholders as to the affairs of the company.</p>
                        <p>Whereas it can thus be argued that the shareholders of a company and the public should know in whom the control of the company is vested, it may not be practicable to require all companies to disclose who the beneficial owners of their shares are. Firstly, such a requirement could create a significant volume of administrative work for the company if its shares should often change hands and the company would be required to keep record of declarations made by beneficial owners of shares held by nominees. Secondly, such a requirement will not ensure that the prescribed information will be available at all times. Thirdly, foreigners who wish to invest in the Republic are often desirous to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals against them in their countries and it is therefore possible that the requirement in question may discourage investment in the Republic or that existing investment by foreigners in the Republic may be withdrawn. Finally, it should also be borne in mind that control over a company may be exercised in many of several subtle ways.</p>
                        <p>*It is proposed, therefore, that section 255 of the Companies Act, 1973, which empowers the responsible Minister to require information concerning persons who have an interest in shares or debentures, be amended. The existing provisions of the section concerned are deficient in some respects and the proposed amendments to the section will remedy these deficiencies.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Bill contains a proposed amendment to section 285(2) of the Act. This relates to the power of a company to change the date of the end of its financial year. It is proposed in the Bill that the section be amended in such a way that a company may only change the date of the end of its financial year during the course of such year, in which event the date of any future financial year will be that date. The company may, however, change that date again.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, hon. Senators on this side of the House support this legislation. As the hon. the Minister has said, it deals with a few fairly important matters, 
                            <i>inter alia</i>, the status of companies in those independent states which previously formed part of the Republic of South Africa. It is as well that we amend our Companies Act timeously to make provision for this. Earlier this year the Association of Accountants had legislation passed which set out clearly the status of those of its members practising in foreign countries. Part of the legislation before us, therefore, is simply consequential legislation in order to effect the necessary adjustments.
                        </p>
                        <p>Then there is the question of disclosing the identity of the shareholders. I am pleased that the Government and the hon. the Minister have realized the disadvantages of such disclosure and that this Bill contains an amending clause to rectify the position. With these few words, Sir, we support this legislation.</p>

                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>It is standing Government policy that Government departments should continually give attention to the renewal and improvement of obsolete legislation. This served as the point of departure for the Bill which is now before this House, which has been drafted with a view to&#x2014;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(1) The consolidation of the principal Act, 1928, and the 15 amending Acts hitherto passed by Parliament; and</li>
                            <li>(2) the improvement and rewording of this legislation to bring it into line with&#x2014;</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(a) the Government&#x2019;s standpoints as laid down in recent legislation of this nature, i.e. the measures regulating the Fisheries Development Corporation, the Indian Industrial Development Corporation, and others; and</li>
                            <li>(b) certain principles contained in the Companies Act.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Mr. President, because the legislation under discussion consists mostly of old material which has simply been consolidated in an improved form, I shall not try to discuss every clause in full, as is customary, and I hope hon. Senators will accept that the details of the legislation can more fruitfully be discussed, if they call for discussion, in the course of the debate and in the Committee Stage, although I do not think it is necessary.</p>
                        <p>However, there are two new aspects contained in the Bill to which I should like to draw your attention. The definition of &#x201C;iron and steel&#x201D; in clause 1 now provides that this means iron and steel in bulk form, e.g. ingots, and that the permission of the Minister of Economic Affairs has to be obtained for the recasting or conversion of these products into other articles. It relates to the Government&#x2019;s basic philosophy of an economic system of free enterprise as also the curtailment of activities of state corporations where this can be done equally efficiently by the private sector. I believe hon. Senators will appreciate the implications of this provision.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, Sir, you will notice that the powers of Iscor as set out in clause 4 are more clearly outlined than is stipulated in the existing Act where the aims and powers of the corporation are summarized in one section and where the two aspects are somewhat entangled and confusing. I also wish to draw attention to clause 4(5) in terms of which the power of the corporation to obtain loans on its own initiative is raised from an amount equal to three-quarters of its issued share capital to an amount equal to its issued share capital.</p>
                        <p>†While, as I have stated, I do not propose to dwell at any length on the contents of the Bill as such, I do think this is an appropriate occasion to refer briefly to Iscor&#x2019;s present financial position. As hon. Senators will know, Iscor&#x2019;s financial difficulties arose mainly from factors beyond the control of its management, such as the 1973 energy crisis which caused recessionary conditions throughout the world economies and consequently a severe fall-off in the local and overseas demand for steel.</p>
                        <p>Therefore at the end of last year I appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. P. F. Theron, Secretary for Industries, with Dr. J. de Loor, Secretary for Finance, Prof. C. W. I. Pistorius, Mr. Kurt Rümelin, General Manager of Iscor, and three other senior members of the Iscor management team as members. This committee has the task of formulating a financial recovery plan for Iscor and I am sure that it will also lay the foundation for an even better future working relationship and co-ordination between Iscor and the Departments of Industries and Finance. The committee has already held two formal meetings and its report with full recommendations has been submitted to me which report I tabled on 20 June 1979.</p>
                        <p>Various external parameters which influence Iscor&#x2019;s profitability have already been analysed by the committee, for example, Iscor&#x2019;s financial structure and the required future steel pricing policy, taking into account adjustments necessary to improve operational earnings in the short term. Agreement has been reached on vital determinants such as the projected local steel demand over the next five years, growth rate, cost escalation rates and Iscor&#x2019;s minimum capital expenditure and requirements. The main aim is to place the corporation once again on the road to profitability within a couple of years without, however, unduly disrupting other sectors of the economy, including the primary and secondary steel industry itself.</p>
                        <p>From the information at my disposal, it would appear that Iscor is already on the road to financial recovery. The corporation probably experienced its worst year in 1977-&#x2019;78. Indications are that the loss for 1978-&#x2019;79 could be substantially less than last year&#x2019;s, and for the following year a further improvement is projected, provided the assumed parameters, which are considered to be conservative, materialize.</p>
                        <p>From the aforegoing it would appear, therefore, that although serious problems are still being experienced, the Corporation has succeeded in reversing the trend of escalating losses. The recovery to full profitability and the time taken to reach this long desired goal will naturally depend on many factors, such as the sustained efforts by management to maintain internal costs and increase productivity generally whilst minimizing capital expenditure, as well as on the vital external elements linked with a positive recovery and healthy growth in the national economy at a reasonable rate of inflation.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister has rightly said that this legislation does not really contain any new ideas or new provisions. In many instances the position has just been stated more clearly so as to bring it into line with the modern requirements of a corporation. Consequently we shall not accept the offer of the hon. the Minister to discuss the matter in Committee. I trust that he will accept our suggestion that the Bill be not committed.</p>
                        <p>I just want to say a few words in connection with the final remark made by the hon. the Minister regarding the activities of Iscor which, over the past few years, have caused Iscor to suffer losses with a resultant increase in the price of steel in an attempt to recoup at least part of those losses. I am pleased that the matter has been thoroughly investigated because the hon. the Minister will know that in our economic life the price of steel can have a very great influence on either lowering or raising the inflation spiral. To check and to control this tendency, Sir, is certainly one of the most important factors affecting the interests of the entire economy of South Africa. I was somewhat disappointed to learn that although the position has more or less been rectified and that the losses have been somewhat less, according to the hon. the Minister, losses will nevertheless still be suffered this year and next year. I trust that the Government and the corporation itself will be patient and wait for an upsurge in the economy and not increase the price of steel again in the near future. This is something which affects the economy of the whole country.</p>
                        <p>While we wish the corporation everything of the best I nevertheless want to make a final request to the hon. the Minister and that is that before the corporation increases its price it should rather try to raise further loans. I notice that provision is made here for the corporation to negotiate bigger loans in future. It used to be three-quarters of its issued share capital but in future it will be 100% of such share capital. Naturally at the time when there was an upsurge in the economy the corporation itself tried to make provision for unforeseen happenings in the future. Of course, the recession which has hit not only South Africa but the entire world has been partly responsible for the decline in that industry and the increase in the losses. I trust that that stage has now been passed and that the price of the products manufactured by the corporation will be stabilized.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AFFAIRS</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I rise once again simply to thank the hon. Senator Swanepoel for supporting this legislation. The very first thing I did when I became Minister of Economic Affairs was to have discussions with the Board of Iscor because there were very clear indications at the time that, as a result of the recession that had just started, drastic attention would have to be given to the financing and price policy of Iscor. It is very easy to be wise after the event, Sir. We have reaped the fruits during the recession of what I consider to have been a too conservative financing and price policy for Iscor. Had the price of steel products risen gradually and had we thus been able to lessen the debt ratio of Iscor it would probably not have been necessary to effect those drastic adjustments later during the recession. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to foresee exactly what will happen and to act accordingly as one would do if one knew those things were going to happen.</p>
                        <p>I want to make two statements in this connection, Sir. I think it is absolutely essential that Iscor&#x2019;s debt ratio be placed on a more favourable level. Iscor&#x2019;s aim should be to be profitable and I think this will demand price adjustments in future. It appears that such adjustments will be more reasonable than those we have had in the past because we are on the road towards financial revery. Just to illustrate this: Sir, you will recall that last year this hon. House had to vote R70 million as a subsidy to Iscor. If certain things happen this year, we expect the losses to be less without a subsidy than they were then with a subsidy. That is a good sign. I do not want to be over-optimistic, Sir, but I do think the foundations have been laid for a successful future for Iscor.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Mr. President, we are exporting steel, for example, at R80 per ton cheaper than the price on the local market. If hon. Senators consider the amount of steel that is exported they will understand how the profitability or otherwise of Iscor is affected in this specific connection. Unfortunately there is still a surplus of steel on the world market. Personally I think that had it not been for the new energy crisis which the industry is facing, the steel industry would have been on the road to recovery. As a result of this factor there will definitely be a slow-down. I trust, however, that we are at one that this wonderful corporation which has meant so much to the industrial development in South Africa over many years, should be placed on the road to prosperity and success. I thank hon. Senators as far as this is concerned.</p>
                        <p>I would have liked to avail myself of the friendly offer of the hon. Senator Swanepoel not to have this Bill committed but I gave an undertaking in the Other Place to effect a small amendment. I shall explain it in a moment.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, if you look at the wording of this clause you will realize that it can possibly be argued that it can be construed to mean that the clause confers a monopoly on Iscor to manufacture steel. I do not agree that that is the meaning that must of necessity be given to the wording but to make sure that people do not in fact gain that impression, I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>In accordance with the stated policy of the hon. the Prime Minister, of rationalization of the State and Government service, recent investigations have brought to light that the existing functions with which the Fuel Research Institute has been charged in terms of the Fuel Research Institute and Coal Act, 1963 (Act No. 35 of 1963), can be subdivided and managed as efficiently by a number of other existing institutions that are well equipped to perform similar functions and are already engaged in or participating in these functions to a certain extent. These functions are the following&#x2014;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(a) To study and investigate the fuel resources of the Republic (section 2(2)(a) of Act 35 of 1963).

                                <p>This task could be undertaken as well by the Geological Survey Division of the Department of Mining&#x2014;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>(b) To undertake scientific and technical research on all matters relating to fuel in general or fuel by-products (section 2(2)(b) of Act 35 of 1963).

                                <p>The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is already undertaking certain fuel studies and can take over the Institute&#x2019;s functions in this regard, while the office of the State Mining Engineer can take over the Institute&#x2019;s research with regard to better methods of mining coal&#x2014;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>(c) To undertake the grading of coal&#x2014; principally for export (section 2(2)(c) of Act 35 of 1963).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The SABS could possibly integrate this function with its existing functions with regard to standardization.</p>
                        <p>†After discussion of the matter on 4 May 1979 by the relevant instances, it was decided that a recommendation be submitted to Government that the Institute be dissolved in its present form and that further negotiations be conducted to reallocate the functions of the Institute on the basis I have just enunciated.</p>
                        <p>As it will only be possible to finalize the necessary negotiations and arrangements in this regard during the Parliamentary recess the purpose of this Bill is merely to enable the Minister of Economic Affairs in the meantime to proceed with the allocation of the functions, duties and funds of the Institute and to arrange for the secondment to the instances concerned of the Institute&#x2019;s personnel for the performance of the relevant functions and duties.</p>
                        <p>As soon as these arrangements have been concluded and finalized a final Bill will be drafted for consideration by Parliament early in 1980.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I wish to say that I fully realize that the private sector&#x2014;the coal industry in particular&#x2014;has a vested interest in the services rendered by the Institute as well as in the facilities available to the Institute in order to enable it to render these services. I therefore wish to put on record that the ultimate dissolution of the Institute will not amount to the termination of these services but that the steps that I have outlined are a serious attempt to establish a more efficient service for all concerned.</p>

                        <from>*Senator 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">P. J. SWANEPOEL</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, we on this side of the House support this brief Bill. Although this legislation is very short and concise it is extremely important legislation to us in South Africa. The high price we have to pay for oil at the moment may perhaps in future, when one thinks back to this period, prove to have been a blessing and not as much a curse as one thinks at the moment. Circumstances are forcing us to devote our energies and abilities to finding alternatives materials that can be converted into fuel and to seeking alternative sources of fuel and energy. It is improbable that the present world supply of oil will be available in the same quantity for very many years to come. Some of the Arabian oil-producing countries have already indicated that if they want to prolong the life of their oilfields they will have to sell less oil on the world markets so that future generations can share in the riches which flow from that oil.</p>
                        <p>We in South Africa are fortunate, of course, in that we have large coal deposits but although we would like to, we will not be able to use coal for all the different forms of fuel we require. The result is that the fuel we can produce from coal will only meet some of our requirements, not all of them. Nevertheless we are very satisfied to see that the Government is giving its serious attention to this kind of research. One never knows what may in the years ahead or perhaps even during this year, one hopes, still be achieved with this kind of research. Even if in the end nothing much is achieved, I still believe it is worth our while to do this kind of research. When one comes to the end of the road one can at least say one has tried although one&#x2019;s efforts have not been successful.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I have just looked at the legislation before me, at all the pieces of legislation concerned. Because the name of this department has been changed we shall in future have to effect a number of amendments to these laws. The designation &#x201C;Economic Affairs&#x201D; now falls away. The designation &#x201C;Commerce and Consumer Affairs&#x201D; replaces it. I wonder whether it is worth the trouble effecting the change. I think the designation &#x201C;Economic Affairs&#x201D; encompassed the whole idea, including commerce and industry. &#x201C;Commerce and Consumer Affairs&#x201D; sometimes encompasses economic affairs which fall outside its scope. I mention that in conclusion, Sir, merely as something to think about in future.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I shall be very brief. I thank the hon. Senator for his co-operation.</p>
                        <p>I want to underline very clearly one remark made by the hon. Senator Swanepoel, and that is that although the world oil crisis has created many problems for the industrial countries and will cause the economic cards of the world to be reshuffled completely; and, secondly, will also affect us indirectly because we are an important industrial country in the world, this crisis has greatly encouraged us to become more and more independent as far as liquid fuel is concerned than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
                        <p>We in South Africa can be proud of the fact that we are world leaders in the production of liquid fuel from coal. I read an article in an American journal recently in which the writer said that the answer to America&#x2019;s liquid fuel problems was an answer that South Africa had already found. In this particular respect the people of Sasol have been pioneers and have done a tremendous job of work for South Africa. From the nature of things we have throughout the years been conducting research into the various sources of energy. That research has now become more urgent because while in the past it may often have been an academic exercise on the part of our institutions and universities, it has now become an applied exercise of necessity.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the question put by the hon. Senator Du Toit the Government&#x2019;s attitude in regard to the manufacture of liquid fuel from replaceable raw material, which includes agricultural products, is influenced by three specific factors. Firstly, whether it has been proved technologically feasible; secondly, whether the raw material is always available; and, thirdly, whether it is economical. I think that answers the hon. Senator&#x2019;s question. The Government will not prohibit any form of manufacture which complies with these specific requirements.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile there are certain amendments to the Electricity Act, 1958, which are not contrary to the recommendations of the Board of Trade and Industries, and which are necessary for good administration of the legislation and for which provision is being made in this Bill. These provisions include the following:</p>
                        <p>Clause 1:</p>
                        <p>In clause 1 it is proposed that the present requirement of the Act that one member of the Electricity Supply Commission should be in the fulltime employment of the commission, be deleted. This complicates the effective composition of the commission.</p>
                        <p>Clause 2:</p>
                        <p>Clause 2 refers to section 4A of the Act. Under this section the commission has the power at present to supply electricity in large quantities to a foreign recipient at any point on the border. This refers to our neighbouring states. The proposed amendment means that any future agreement for the supply of electricity by the commission in this regard, is subject to prior consent by the responsible Minister.</p>
                        <p>†Clause 3:</p>
                        <p>One of the basic principles of the Companies Act, 1973, is that of publication of information for the benefit of interested persons, add in this particular case also for the benefit of creditors.</p>
                        <p>This clause provides that in addition to the balance sheet and income statement to be furnished by the commission it should now also furnish a statement of the source and application of its funds and that all these statements should as far as may be determined by the commission be in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1973.</p>
                        <p>Clause 4:</p>
                        <p>In clause 4 it is proposed that the present membership of the Electricity Control Board be increased from five to seven persons. In this regard I can only say that in the Government&#x2019;s opinion the board&#x2019;s membership should also include persons with the qualifications referred to in clause 4 for the proper performance of its important task.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, we support this legislation. One of the best things this hon. Minister did at the time was to have the tariff policy of this specific corporation investigated. I say this because, just as in the case of the products of other corporations, this is also something that can have very far-reaching repercussions on our economy as far as the inflation spiral is concerned. As this legislation is aimed at promoting greater competency and efficiency, we support it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, I move&#x2014;</p>
                        <block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>
                        <p>I think hon. Senators will quite probably agree with me when I say that the legislation about to be considered by the House is one of the most important pieces of legislation which has ever been considered here. I think we must relate this legislation to an undertaking which was given by the hon. the Prime Minister when he assumed office as Prime Minister last year. In this connection it is important to note that this undertaking was given by the Prime Minister before the full circumstances of what is known today as the Information debacle were disclosed. Hon. Senators will remember that the hon. the Prime Minister pledged himself to a clean administration for South Africa as one of the highest national objectives which he had set for himself and South Africa. Hon. Senators will also remember that the hon. the Prime Minister pledged himself on the same occasion to orderly government in South Africa. I maintain today that there is a specific connection between clean administration of a country and orderly government. I believe that the one cannot exist without the other.</p>
                        <p>In view of this it was necessary, in addition to the existing mechanisms to ensure clean administration, to go one step further and create a new institution. In this respect I refer hon. Senators to the existing institutions relating in this particular sphere to the subject forming the basis of the Bill. In the first place we find the institution of the office of Auditor-General. As far as his functions are concerned, he is dependent in the first place on the Executive for his appointment. When the Executive has made this appointment, he functions quite independently of the Executive. In fact, after his appointment he is not responsible to the Executive, but in terms of his own legislation only to Parliament itself. So in respect of the duties conferred on him in terms of his own legislation, he is one of the mechanisms which is instituted to ensure that the Executive, as far as the appropriation of funds of the State is concerned, complies with the conditions which Parliament laid down when it approved such expenditure. Over the years this particular office, and the occupiers of that office, have built up a tradition of the highest Parliamentary integrity. I do not want to turn this discussion into a discussion of the Press, and I hope hon. Senators will follow my example in this particular respect, but the fact remains that in spite of all the upheaval &#x2026;</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>I shall have something to say about the Press.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>The hon. Senator may do so with pleasure. I prefer not to do it, but I do want to make a point in this connection. The institution of the Auditor-General was the institution which initially took the first step to disclose the irregularities in regard to the former Department of Information. What happened afterwards is history; I just want to make the point that this Parliament created the mechanisms to help ensure that we would keep the national administration as clean as possible. The Auditor-General could do that because he was specifically not responsible to the Executive, but to Parliament itself.</p>
                        <p>I now come to the second organization, viz. the Police who were appointed to do investigative work in connection with crime, whether that applies to the private sector or the public sector. In this particular connection the police, like other State departments, are subject to instructions and decisions of the Executive.</p>
                        <p>A third organization which is involved in the running of the country and its administration is the office of the Attorney-General. Let me say at once in terms of the debates which have taken place in recent months&#x2019; nobody would accept that Attorneys-General did not fall under the Executive.</p>
                        <p>If my fundamental statement of attitude is followed, then, it appears to me that because of the assurance and maintenance of clean national administration in a broader sense than the purely auditing function of the Auditor-General, another instrument must be called into being to help ensure that this worthy and estimable objective of clean administration can be achieved and maintained. As I see it&#x2014;and hon. Senators may differ with me here&#x2014;there are certain requirements or qualifications which must apply in such an institution.</p>
                        <p>To sum up I should like to mention the following, not as an exhaustive list of requirements, but as a list of important requirements. In the first place I would say that it must be independent of the executive. This would mean that although it owes its existence to the executive authority of the State President-in-Council, the body to which it must submit reports after its appointment is Parliament itself. This, of course, we can only ensure and maintain if the decision-making, or the institution where decisions are taken pursuant to that report, is Parliament itself. This implies an important thing: it implies that the parliamentary authority and the status of Parliament are elevated, and that is implicit in the legislation before us. But there is a second point which is important, and that is that there must be confidence in the institutions which must co-operate to ensure clean national administration.</p>
                        <p>I want to ask at once: How do we create general confidence in the general public in such an institution or such a post? I start by saying that the first requirement is the very fact that it must be independent in terms of its inquiry and in terms of the body to which it must report. I think the second important requirement to ensure confidence in this post and its incumbents are the requirements laid down for the incumbent of this post. And if you look at the legislation before you you will find the prescriptive provisions in respect of the qualifications of the person to occupy the post are in certain cases higher than those set for the Bench. A minimum academic qualification is specifically laid down, but secondly a minimum period of experience in the administration of justice is required. In other words, the second element for the creation of confidence is there. There is a third requirement which is important, Sir, and that is that this body must be seen to function.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Yes, that is a good remark. I agree with the hon. Senator. The fact that it is an age-old truth does not detract from the truth of the statement. Perhaps we should tell one another these old truths more often.</p>
                        <p>The third element is that it must be seen to function. If hon. Senators look at the Bill before them, they will see that the requirement of this office and this institution is that it must function in public. The Advocate-General will, like a court, have the right of discretion, in certain circumstances to act 
                            <i>in camera</i> and in others it is obliged to act 
                            <i>in camera.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a fourth element which is important and that is that the legislation which creates the institution must itself make provision for the institution to be protected against people that want to destroy it or bring it in contempt. That is why hon. Senators will find in the legislation they are considering that there is provision in respect of the protection of the incumbent of the post, in respect of the administration, the obligations or the functions entrusted to this office. The officials occupying the post will be entitled, as is the case with the supreme court, to summarily sentence any person who contravenes in this respect.</p>
                        <p>There is a further important element and that is to ensure confidence. And that, Mr. President, I want to say with great respect today, is a matter for the institution and the members who constitute that institution. That is a matter for hon. Senators in this House. We are making history, Mr. President, by creating this post and this Parliament is creating it. It is therefore the responsibility of this Parliament and its members, when discussing legislation which initiates a new convention in the administration of our country, to refrain from casting suspicion on this office before its birth, as it were. Sir, I would be failing in my duty if I did not express my disappointment that certain bodies and members of political parties have cast suspicion on this institution, before its birth, in the minds of the general public. In this particular respect, Sir, you will permit me to remark that the main object of the legislation, even in the initial form in which it was introduced in the Other Place, was to help ensure a clean administration. The provisions which later became the controversial provisions which were deleted from the Bill, tried to do no more than help achieve that main object.</p>
                        <p>I find it strange that there were hon. members who thought that to lay down a requirement that only the truth should be published was an offence. I find that strange. I hope this hon. House will not lend itself to such a point of view.</p>
                        <p>But I want to take it further, because I owe it to the hon. Senators in this House. In this connection I must tell you that because the Government was in earnest about creating this instrument, it was prepared to dispense with this provision which was used to cast suspicion on the legislation and the institution. I find it equally strange that in this particular case reasonableness on the part of the Government is being interpreted as weakness. The Government accepts that such a responsibility rests on itself and on any government in the democratic world. In the final instance it is responsible for the efficient and effective management of the country. It is responsible to ensure that the management and the administration are as clean as possible. It also accepts that there is a responsibility on the media of the country to be sensitive to the interests of the country in their reporting of allegations of irregularity or alleged irregularity. I myself have no axe to grind with the media as institutions 
                            <i>per se.</i> I think it is wrong to condemn the media and the Press simply because of the task they have to perform. It is also wrong that we should adopt the attitude that all the media are irresponsible, because that is not true. There are responsible media in the country which make just as big a contribution to the maintenance of democracy and its institutions as we do in this Highest House.
                        </p>
                        <p>We must all take care that we do not achieve what people would like us to achieve, namely that the responsible media find themselves in the line of fire as a result of a common definition and condemnation of that type of media which South Africa cannot afford. We are in the process of applying a principle throughout, and for that I am grateful. If in the final instance we are to make this organization effective, it must be accessible to the man in the street. It must be a place where the man in the street can give information concerning what he knows about irregularities, malpractices, dishonesty or corruption.</p>
                        <p>If hon. Senators agree with me then in regard to the aims and the main objects of the legislation, then I ask that in our discussions of the Bill before us we should not be guided by the hysterical outbursts which have taken place in regard to this legislation for many weeks. Let us rather, in the calm atmosphere of this hon. House do what we are called upon to do as responsible people who also have a review function, namely to ensure that reason and rational argument shall triumph as opposed to those incidents elsewhere which have not always been very pleasant.</p>
                        <p>In a spirit of the Government&#x2019;s commitment to restrict malpractices to a minimum, because it can never be completely restricted, I ask hon. Senators to accept this legislation as an instrument for clean administration, because that is what it is intended to be.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, the ancient Romans used to say on occasions 
                            <i>ave atque vale</i>, which means &#x201C;Hail and farewell&#x201D;. This afternoon we say farewell to the hon. the Minister in his capacity as Minister of Economic Affairs and we hail him in his new capacity as Minister of Transport Affairs. We express the wish that his activities in his new sphere will be in the interests of South Africa and to the greater good of South Africa.
                        </p>
                        <p>*Mr. President, my approach towards this Bill and, in fact, to the whole matter, is determined by what is good for South Africa. I am not really concerned about what is good for the Government party, nor, in this case, about what is good for my side of the Senate. The question is what is good for South Africa, and this will be my approach in respect of this legislation. I trust that what I have to say will be accepted in that spirit.</p>
                        <p>†Mr. President, this legislation has had a long and fairly chequered history. We have in fact a Bill numbered 87, 87A, 87B, and 87C, so it has had a long history, and I must say that I am reasonably happy with the end of that history. In fact, Sir, I can say now that we on these benches will support the motion for the Second Reading. I do, however, want to make one or two remarks.</p>
                        <p>In the course of this long history things have happened that have done South Africa little good, just as the Information scandal which obviously was the basic reason for legislation of this sort, has done South Africa little good. We are all sorry about the Information scandal. I have said before, Mr. President, that I take no joy in it. I never have taken any joy in it. I realize very clearly, however, that this legislation is an almost logical necessity after what has happened.</p>
                        <p>The legislation contains, as the hon. the Minister in his skilful speech has outlined, two principles. The one is the appointment of an Advocate-General who will report to the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. I have pleasure in stressing that, as the hon. the Minister himself did, because you will know, Sir, that my standpoint in this House has always been that Parliament should be the ultimate controller in respect of the affairs of the Republic, and not the executive. The executive is responsible to Parliament.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>I know the hon. the Minister accepts that and I say that very gladly. So here we have the first principle and that is the appointment of an officer who will report to Parliament after investigating any allegations made to him on affidavit in respect of the misapplication or the mismanagement, misappropriation or the dishonest usage of funds.</p>
                        <p>The second provision is designed to prevent speculative, unfair Press reporting with regard to the above matters&#x2014;that is as the Bill now stands. Unfortunately, that is not how it started.</p>
                        <p>But let me say that the immediate public reaction to the question of the appointment of an Advocate-General, of an officer of this sort, is a favourable reaction. I have spoken to my friends, and I have a few in many circles, and the general reaction among the people outside in all walks of life is that the appointment of an Advocate-General is to be publicly welcomed. That is the reaction. I am of the same opinion and I support the establishment of this office. I support it moreover in the shape in which it is being established. If one studies the legislation one will see that the conditions of appointment and dismissal of the incumbent of this post are precisely those that apply to the appointment of the Controller and Auditor-General. The establishment of this post and the appointment of an officer to it with the qualifications that are laid down in the Bill, are completely acceptable to me.</p>
                        <p>The second principle contained in the original Bill was quite truly designed to prevent speculative reporting, inaccurate reporting, but, in preventing that, the provisions of the original Bill would also have prevented responsible investigative reporting.</p>

                        <p>Yes, I accept that. But I must just sketch the history of this Bill. When I say that this Bill has done the image of South Africa little good, I am referring to it in its original form, because both in and outside South Africa the Government was immediately accused, and rightly so in terms of the original Bill, or seeking to muzzle the Press, of seeking to gag the Press. That second principle as embodied in the original Bill was a gagging principle. I accept that this was consequential, as the hon. the Minister has said, but there it was and it did us no good. In this respect I must blame the Government for hastily embodying in a piece of draft legislation provisions that appeared to the public both here and in the world outside as if the intent was to stop proper, responsible investigative reporting. However, Sir, I will not pursue that line much further.</p>
                        <p>I want to say a word or two about the Press. The hon. the Minister has already said something about the Press, and I want to agree with him that there are responsible journalists and responsible media and that there are irresponsible journalists and irresponsible media. This is so in the nature of things. But there is an incontrovertible fact, whether we like it or not, and that is that a modern democracy cannot function without a free Press, be it responsible or irresponsible. And I will say why, Sir. In the days of the Athenian democracy it was very easy for the leaders of the people to convene all the people, all the citizens by ringing the tocsin bell. The people would then come together in the public forum and the leaders would address them and acquaint them of the situation that had to be faced at the particular time, whatever that situation might have been. It was very simple because there was direct contact and communication between the representatives of the people and the people themselves.</p>
                        <p>In the early days of South African politics also our leaders would go out into the country and stand upon an ox-wagon and address the people. That, Sir, in the modern situation with the tremendous increase in the population is no longer possible. We here are still in a fairly fortunate position because we have constituencies of 16 000 or 17 000 people&#x2014; and I refer here to our members of the Other Place. But even with 16 000 or 17 000 people, no elected representative of those people in the constituency can maintain contact with them by himself. He needs a medium. And, of course, in countries where there are 100 000 or 500 000 people in a constituency the thing becomes impossible. The working of modern democracy is therefore dependent upon the existence of the media because otherwise there is no way in which the representative of the people can communicate his thoughts and report his actions to the people who elected him. Therefore, whether we like it or not, the media are a necessary evil or a necessary benefit, take it as you like. They are necessary, and that is the point. I must say that there is very often irresponsibility in the functioning of the media in other countries and in this country. To the extent that there is this irresponsibility, democracy itself suffers, because there is a distortion of what is really thought and said by the leaders and what the people are led to believe by the media that the leaders think and say. The more accurate and responsible the Press is, the better democracy functions. But you have to have a freely operating press, otherwise democracy does not work.</p>
                        <p>I have said that the original Bill did not do South Africa&#x2019;s image much good. I have said that the Press should be responsible. That is the ideal situation. I do not suppose that all of us are responsible all the time. I am not now making references to any of my colleagues!</p>
                        <p>This Bill went to a Select Committee and it emerged from that Select Committee in what is to me and my colleagues a much more acceptable form because the Bill as it stands leaves only the appointment of an Advocate-General. I believe this is a good thing and I have already said that I believe that the public outside believe it is a good thing.</p>
                        <p>The Bill has another provision which deals with the status of the Advocate-General in relation to the media and anybody else. This provision is embodied in clause 8. Clause 8 provides first of all that nobody shall insult, disparage or belittle the Advocate-General of an assistant to the Advocate-General. This is right. I do not believe that this official, this highly placed officer, should be placed in a position where he can lightly be insulted, disparaged or belittled.</p>

I think the clause is too wide. The word &#x201C;anticipate&#x201D; in that sense is well understood by us, but it is not well understood by everybody. This clause is the only remaining peg upon which the opposition to this Bill is being hung. This clause, particularly the reference to anticipating the proceedings at an inquiry, is the only remaining target in this Bill. It is the target of my political rivals in the PFP and it is the main target of some of the media.</p>

                            <i>ave atque vale.</i> I will move the amendment at the Committee Stage, but I wish to say finally that it is a pity that this Bill first appeared in the form that it did, because it really then looked like a Bill which was aimed at muzzling the free Press. I have said that, fortunately or unfortunately, a free Press is essential to the working of a democracy and that the muzzling of a free Press actually strikes at the basis of democracy. I have said why. If you do that, you destroy the communication between the elected representatives of the people and the people themselves. You destroy it or you limit it, or you qualify it or you condition it. The Bill looked like that in its first form. I want to say that I am appreciative of the fact that it has now emerged differently. In fact, it will be even better when the hon. the Minister accepts my amendment. Therefore, and on behalf of my colleagues, I declare my support for the Second Reading of the Bill.

The one is a public servant who can put your file right at the bottom of the pile on his desk. The other is the private secretary to a Minister because they can prevent your representations reaching the Minister. The third person is a journalist because they can give you a very bad name in the newspapers.</p>

                        <p>Or say nothing about you. *Senator Dr. J. H. LOOCK: Yes, they ignore you to death or they finish you off with scandal. I was fairly intimately concerned with two newspapers, 
                            <i>Die</i>
                            <i>Suiderstem</i> and 
                            <i>Die</i>
                            <i>Landstem.</i> Anybody connected with 
                            <i>Die Landstem</i> knows a bit more about journalism than a person who has worked on an ordinary newspaper. I have a very high respect for and appreciation of the Press, therefore. I am pleased about the form of this Bill before the House, because I did not care too much for the first Bill either. Before I go any further with my speech, I should like to congratulate our President on the high office he now occupies. I want to do this in a personal capacity because 15 years ago I entered into a gentleman&#x2019;s agreement with the hon. President when I asked him to vote for me as Senator. Little did I dream 15 years ago that he would be my superior at the end of my career in the Upper House of Parliament. I fulfilled my part of the bargain and I take it that he will fulfil his. I told him yesterday that our previous two presidents took a few months before they were comfortable in that Chair, but as far as he is concerned he occupies the Chair as though the Chair was made for him. I hope he will spend a long and happy time here, perhaps longer than we think.
                        </p>
                        <p>I should also like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his enhanced status as Minister of Transport Affairs. They say that many countries would have had far better governments if their people had not become too tired to govern, and our value in South Africa lies in the fact that our people do not get tired of governing. If there is one thing we can admire about this hon. Minister it is his boundless energy, and as long as we have Ministers like that in the Cabinet we shall not be too tired to govern the country. He likes helping to govern the country.</p>
                        <p>Now I want to say that this Government is not the only one involved in scandals. There are two ways of bringing out the downfall of a government; either by rejecting its policy or through financial scandals. There has never been a case in this Parliament in all the years I have sat here, and I have been here since 1935, where either a member of Parliament or a Minister or anyone else got away with a financial scandal. That redounds to the credit of the South African Parliament. You can get up to a lot of things in this hon. House in other respects &#x2026;</p>

We know about the days of the Kopersbond. And from 1948 the Opposition has tried continually to bring about our downfall through monetary and financial scandals. Many of these scandals were not uncovered by the Press. Many of these scandals were first brought to light by the NP. As far as the Agliotti scandal was concerned, I was the first man to say at a meeting of the executive committee that the Agliotti transaction was a scandal, because I am in the property business and I knew about it.</p>

                        <p>No, because we did not have an Advocate-General. That was just the trouble, and that is why I am so pleased that we will now have an Advocate-General. If we had had an Advocate-General then I could have gone to him and not to the executive committee. I heard of the Information scandal long before it was raised here in Parliament Mr. President if one moves in business circles in Johannesburg one hears more stories than in the whole of the rest of South Africa.</p>

                        <p>The NP Government did not cover up these things. You know how many of the Ministers and Deputy Ministers were involved in this. It is not a case of their having done something wrong or stolen money, to put it that way. They were involved quite incidentally. Take a man like Dirkie Uys; he is out. He had nothing to do with the Agliotti scandal, but he was the Minister concerned. Take the case of Rall; take the case of Mr. Jan Haak who had to leave partly because of that. So this Government has shown over the years that it does not mind disclosing facts. And where people in high places have been involved, they have been dismissed. When this Information scandal became known, the first man who had to go was the Secretary of the Department and after that the Minister went. Recently we had the position, as a result of the Erasmus report, where even the State President resigned.</p>
                        <p>We do therefore have a record of good administration, but what we want to do through this Bill is to appoint an Advocate-General so that if one hears something, one can go to him. We have no objection to the Press publishing things, but then they must not publish untruths. That the Press was so concerned about the legislation was not entirely true either. I have 
                            <i>The Cape Times</i> here and it has a photograph of Mr. Eglin at a lunch time protest meeting in the Cape Town City Hall. It shows six people there waiting their turn to speak, and I can only see five in the audience. Everybody can see this, but it shows the enormous influence of the Press when it wants to distort something. I think there was more agitation against the Press than is symbolized in this photograph, but at the same time it shows how a newspaper can destroy its own people. The Minister himself can see from this that there was not all that much agitation, not even against the first Bill.
                        </p>
                        <p>The only objection we have to the Press is that if they find out something like this and hang a label round a man&#x2019;s neck, then they hammer away at it, as they did with the Information scandal, until after the Minister has resigned and the Secretary of the department has resigned. They gnaw away at it 
                            <i>ad nauseam.</i> And there is something we are not blind to, Mr. President, viz. that these bodies seek out a certain section of the Press and that, of course, we must oppose, and we shall oppose it. A certain section of the Press seeks out destruction; they want to bring about the fall of the Government.
                        </p>
                        <p>Financial scandals have been used by them since 1938 to try to unseat the Government They started with me. When I came to Parliament in 1949 they sent the brother of a former Cabinet Minister to me with an offer of R500 000 (£250 000), and I was asked to bribe five people in Parliament. I do not want to give the names here, but I could give you the names. At that time we only had a majority of five in Parliament. I had to organize things so that those five would not vote for the Government on some legislation or other, and in that way the Government would be defeated. Each of us would then take £50 000 (R100 000) and get out of politics. Then I said: &#x201C;No, I prefer sitting on the green benches.&#x201D; In those days I was not as keen on money as I am now. But if they were to make me an offer now I might consider it.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that we must furnish proof of what had happened in the old governments. This is tangible evidence of what happened to be personally, i.e. that for R250 000 I had to bribe people. That is as much as Kallie Knoetze got for his fight in Mmabatho. Then I had to bring down the whole NP Government! Sir, I do not want to delve deeper into the past; after all, I lived through the war years. I know what happened to the sheep farms they bought up for the returned soldiers. I know who farmed on them and at what price they farmed on them, while the soldiers were still up north. That is why we lost the election at the time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I do not want to go into these matters any further because just now I will have deviated too far from the clause. I have said I am not a legal man; I just wanted to say a few words to put the practical view of the practical people in politics. I think if the Advocate-General is appointed, and he stays in the Carlton Hotel for a week, he will have work to do.</p>

I am no personal friend of the Press, or that kind of thing. But let us look back at the history of this matter. How many organizations raised their voices about the original legislation? I am very pleased that the Government saw fit to effect these amendments. I feel quite happy about them. Let us just see which organizations raised their voices about this matter. It was not only the Press, Sir. It was the Dutch Reformed Church, the ASB, the Railway trade unions, the Staff Association of the SABC&#x2014;that organization which is dominated by the Government, His Master&#x2019;s Voice. Even they spoke out against it [Interjections.] If the editor of

                            <i>Vaderland</i> was still attached to

                            <i>Vaderland</i> objected to the original legislation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Everybody requested that the legislation should please be reconsidered. I want to say again that I am very pleased that the Government did so. What did Prof. Strauss of Unisa say? His words were&#x2014;</p>

                        <p>Oh, I beg your pardon. I am just thinking of everything that was said about the Press. I just want to stress that it was not only the Press. I think all right-thinking people&#x2014;and of course we had no objections from that side of the House&#x2014;in South Africa thought about it for the reasons which the hon. Senator Horak spelt out very clearly here. It did not do the image of South Africa any good. When we first heard the story of the Information scandal, I said in this House that there were two things that had improved the image of South Africa. In spite of the fact that none of us wanted this sort of thing&#x2014;I certainly find no joy in it&#x2014;the world outside could still say that South Africa still had a free Press, and secondly that the Bench, because of the actions of Mr. Justice Mostert, was still the most just and wonderful Bench in the world. That is why I say that we should not put all the blame on the Press. I know it was said in some sections that the Press and the public had become hysterical. I do not think that is really true. I think all the organizations I have mentioned pleaded for this legislation to be improved. Consequently I think it was very sensible of the Government to effect these amendments. Having received the assurance from the hon. the Minister, I shall most definitely vote for the Bill.</p>
                        <p>I do have a few reservations about the appointment of the Advocate-General.</p>

                        <p>The hon. the Minister said&#x2014;and he could be right&#x2014;that we are making history today by accepting this legislation which establishes the post of Advocate-General. I just hope his appointment is no reflection of what we can expect in the future. I hope there will be no corruption. The other point I want to make very clear is that I hope it will never cast any reflection on our highly respected Public Service, because I think we have officials in this country who are absolutely trustworthy. Every now and then one finds a black sheep, but that was really an error of judgment on the part of the Cabinet of the former Government. They appointed a person over the heads of other people, and he is the major culprit. I think that all right-thinking people have the highest appreciation of the Public Service and I hope that in time the Advocate-General will have so little to do that we can discharge him from his post.</p>
                        <p>With those few words I should like to support the legislation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President in the first place may I, together with the other speakers, congratulate you on the high office you occupy. I have often had the pleasure of seeing you in action in this House. It was a great privilege, and this is the first time you will have to listen to me from the Chair. That is also a privilege. I hope my contribution will meet with your approval.</p>
                        <p>May I also congratulate the hon. the Minister on the high office he now occupies. I know that his tracks are clearly visible, in the sunlight and the moonlight. We know those are good tracks and he will stay on the right road.</p>
                        <p>As the hon. the Minister said, the object of this legislation is a clean Government and a clean administration. That was how our hon. Prime Minister put it. Here we have the opportunity of preventing a recurrence of the problems we had in regard to the Information scandal. Had the Advocate-General already been in office, this scandal would never have assumed the proportions it did. This debate has taken place in such a sensible and calm atmosphere that I do not want to say anything to disturb this good spirit. But the fact remains that the slogan of some newspapers was: &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t go away.&#x201D; There was an editorial with that heading: &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t go away.&#x201D; Had there been an Advocate-General that situation of: &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t go away&#x201D; would not have occurred. It would have gone to the Advocate-General and through his investigation it would have been laid before the Speaker or the Leader of the House, as provided in the Act. It would then have gone to a select committee consisting of members of all parties. They would have thrashed out the matter. As the hon. the Minister said, it would then have been in the hands of Parliament, i.e. those who are really responsible for the administration of the country, and not with the executive authority where the hon. Senator Horak wanted it. In this I agree with him one hundred per cent. It belongs in Parliament. It would have ended up there.</p>
                        <p>The fact that this scandal assumed these enormous proportions and caused such damage, as other hon. Senators have mentioned here, is due to the fact that there was no other way of dealing with it on an objective and non-emotional basis. If it could have been done on that basis, this situation would never have arisen. The situation regarding the Press is a very old one. The conflict between the Press and the authorities has been going on for a long time in the history of South Africa. I happened to read that 
                            <i>The South African Commercial Advertiser</i> which was printed by a certain George Greig, the editors of which were Pringle and Fairburn, published 18 editions in 1824. The editions were so anti-administration that they were censored. Their press was closed down. Greig was deported. He went to Parliament in England and asked that his Press should be reinstated. The then Secretary of Colonial Affairs upheld Greig&#x2019;s appeal and he came back to South Africa and opened his press again. He had hardly started printing when he was banned again. The conflict between the Press and the authorities has been going on for a long time. It has happened repeatedly in our history.
                        </p>
                        <p>How can one prevent such situations arising, as will in fact happen in future, if there is no such institution as the Advocate-General. It will make the relationship between the authorities and the Press much sounder, because it will take place at the level where an authorized body will deal with the allegations laid before it. The truth or otherwise of all the allegations made are then properly tested. It will go to Parliament where it will be tested once again, so that in all respects the public can be one hundred per cent satisfied that the complaint made has been dealt with properly. Then the Press will also be able to feel the responsibility for any publication they make, because their statements will be tested by the Advocate-General. Let us put it this way: Any Tom, Dick or Harry can come forward with a complaint now, but to prevent such wild allegations being made, it must be done by way of affidavits. There is also the protection that when a complaint is made, there must be substance to the complaint, which is also important. When a complaint is made, it must have substance.</p>
                        <p>The hon. the Minister dealt very fully with all the aspects of the Act as such and what the intention of the Act would be. There is only one aim, viz. clean administration. There is not the slightest attempt to curb the Press. Where we had differences of opinion in regard to the original legislation, we have cleared up those differences of opinion. This is a sign of the sound democratic approach of the Government which proves that in the heat of the battle it can listen to what its critics have to say. Its ears were opened wide to listen to the justness of the good arguments which came from all sides. The hon. Senator Du Toit told us here where all the complaints came from. The fact that the Government lent an ear to the opinion of one and all is after all a sign of the sound approach and the 
                            <i>bona fide</i> sincere intentions which the Government has in regard to the matter and the object they want to achieve. It is fitting therefore that I should compliment the hon. the Minister on the mature way in which this legislation has been piloted through all its stages. This is once again a sign of how anxious the Government is to obtain the opinion of one and all, so that we can have unanimity here and feel that we are all on the right track. It is a great pleasure for me to support this legislation.

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, in the first place I want to thank the hon. Senator Horak for his friendly farewell and also for his friendly reception. It was pleasant to come to this hon. House with my old responsibilities. In this connection I have only pleasant memories of my association with hon. Senators in this hon. House.</p>
                        <p>I also want to say thank you for two other things. Firstly, my thanks to hon. Senators for their support for this legislation in principle, and secondly for the pleasant atmosphere in which the debate took place.</p>
                        <p>The hon. Senator Horak was quite right in saying that this legislation has something of a history, and some of the periods in the course of this history were less pleasant. But I want to tell the hon. Senator Du Toit at once that there is no one on this side of the House who does not deeply regret the incidents and the circumstances which led to the irregularities&#x2014;and I am stating it euphemistically&#x2014; connected with the now defunct Department of Information.</p>

                        <from>*The 
                            <person refersTo="hansard">MINISTER</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Yes, all of us regret them. We must not make the mistake of assuming that it was only the NP and the Government that has been harmed; South Africa has been harmed. Even though we differ as political parties, I have always assumed that all of us, at least as political parties, have the interests of South Africa at heart. I also assumed that although we might differ as to our methods of how we would best serve our country, we do not differ in our object that we want to achieve. This legislation has its origin in the spirit of the fact that what is important is the interests of South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I do not want to delay the Second Reading debate any further, apart from making a few fundamental remarks on the contributions of all the hon. Senators who have spoken here this afternoon. Firstly, put quite simply, the Bill at its commencement sought to establish an instrument which would effectively help, together with legislation which already exists, to ensure pure, honest and clean administration for our country. At the beginning it was felt necessary to include restrictions in regard to publication in the Bill, not as an object in itself, but in order to ensure that the main object would be achieved in a way which would not prejudice the country&#x2019;s interests, and which would ensure the publication of the full truth concerning alleged irregularities. I want to stress this&#x2014;would ensure the publication of the full truth. The reaction to the specific provisions dealing with publication or non-publication by the media and the Opposition&#x2014;a reaction with which I do not necessarily agree, but which I do not want to debate because it is no longer relevant&#x2014;was such, however, that suspicion was cast on the achievement of the main object of the legislation. And the main object would have miscarried if the Government had decided to go ahead with those provisions.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, I want to say that that was never the intention, and in order to achieve the main object of the Government it was decided to relinguish the restrictive measures to avoid even the appearance of wrong, as I have already explained to hon. Senators. But I must stress that the Government in this respect still accepts that we shall only be able to have an effective functioning of this instrument if there is general confidence in the office and the incumbent. I really do hope that the omission of these restrictive provisions will contribute to the creation of this confidence and that everyone, hon. Senators opposite and the media as well, will avoid themselves of this opportunity to help create confidence, and that no further suspicion will be cast on this measure, as happened in the Other Place this morning.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the omission of the provisions and the fact that reason has triumphed in this case, I want to stress that this does not detract from our objects. The Government is not relinquishing its standpoint, namely that all the media which claim to be free and to serve democracy have an obligation, and that is to verify the truthfullness of what they publish. Democracy can only be upheld by a free Press or a free media, with the qualification that freedom is not licence, and that freedom is not licentiousness, but that freedom implies responsibility. This applies to the media as much as it does to us, because restriction of our freedom is the protection of the freedom of others. The restriction on the freedom of the media is the recognition of the freedom of the subject they are writing about. If we agree with one another on this&#x2014;and I do not think we differ&#x2014;we as an institution and the media as an institution, because both have their origin in democracy itself, will co-operate with each other in future instead of opposing each other. Seen in that light, Mr. President, a lot of good has been born from the course of this legislation, and for this I am grateful and I think hon. Senators will share that view with me.</p>
                        <p>In this connection there is a second important point, viz. that the Government has accepted assurances from the media that they in their turn they will make efforts during the recess to ensure that they will achieve what we regard as a common objective, and that they will achieve it in consultation and discussions with the Government itself. I hope that those of us who put such enormous trust in the media will not be disappointed and will not have to resort to other steps. One of the most important rules in the code of the media is to ensure that the truth is published. Because if one takes liberties with the truth and does not put a high price on it, the function of dissemination of information, which is the responsibility of the media, is not fulfilled. And the function of education, for which the media is also responsible is not fulfilled either, for education has just one basis, Sir, and that is the search for truth. Without the truth there is no education or training. In my view we have come a long way to be able to have this common approach today.</p>
                        <p>†I accept that for democracy to survive the media have to survive, but for the survival of both the search for the truth is a prerequisite. I would like to stress this point. I do not believe that this Government or any government for that matter, is infallible. I do not even pretend that I am; but the Government and I, like other hon. members of this House, are committed to seek the truth, to seek what is best for this country and to avoid the misappropriation of public funds and corruption. This legislation is not intended as a slur on people in Government whether they be in the executive section of Government or in the administrative section of Government. However, it endorses one basic truth, viz. that people in public life are never lauded and should not expect to be lauded for attaining 99% success, but to be condemned for their 1% failures. This is the hazard of the job which does not make it very pleasant. Let me say as one man to other men, it is not pleasant for one&#x2019;s family either. We have to take care lest good men avoid public life because they are not prepared to accept this risk. There is a saying that when good men do nothing, rogues take over. We have to guard against this, all of us have to guard against this, including the media. I hope that when the test really comes we will all be weighed in the balance and not found to be wanting.</p>
                        <p>*I have already referred to what was said by the hon. Senator Du Toit and have replied to his inquiries, for he asked who had cast suspicion on the legislation under suspicion. I do not want to identify culprits now, except to say that suspicion was cast on this legislation before it was published. I think that with this I have replied to the question. I also want to thank the hon. Senator Van Zijl for his contribution. I agree with him that it is a natural action of governments and people not to expose their mistakes. However, because that is the duty of the media on the other hand, there will obviously be a conflict Our task is to see whether we can find a method of reconciling these two points of departure. So in this particular aspect this legislation constitutes a reconciliatory element I also want to thank the hon. Senator Dr. Loock for his contribution. One might not believe it, but the hon. Senator and I come from the same part of the world, only I have not made as many detours as he has done to get where we are today.</p>
                        <p>†When I listened to the hon. Senator this afternoon, I thought that this was a session for confession. I have some legal advice for the hon. Senator for which he need not pay. He indicated that if he were to receive that same offer again of R500 000 he might be tempted to take it. I want to tell him that it is also a crime to incite crime.</p>
                        <p>*I want to thank hon. Senators for their support for this measure. I have indicated that I shall accept the amendment of the hon. Senator Horak, and in this connection I just want to say that I shall move an amendment to clause 4 during the Committee Stage. At present the clause provides that &#x201C;any person who has reason to suspect&#x201D;, and I want to substitute for these words &#x201C;if any person has reasonable grounds to suspect&#x201D;. I did not accept the amendment in the Other Place, but after the Committee Stage had been taken, I thought about the matter again and decided that I would effect this amendment.</p>

                        <p>The insertion of these words speaks for itself, but I would like to point out that it removes beyond any shadow of doubt the idea that there is any intention of curbing the Press. It will now only be an offence if the findings or the inquiry of the Advocate-General are anticipated with the intention of influencing them. As the hon. the Minister has indicated that he will accept the amendment, this side of the House will support the Third Reading.</p>

                        <p>I should like to take the opportunity, while introducing this motion, of expressing my thanks to certain people. I want to start, Mr. President, and I know I am speaking on behalf of everyone in this House when I do so, by expressing our thanks and appreciation to the former President of the Senate, the hon. Senator Marais Viljoen, who now, of course, occupies the high office of State President. I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate too much on this part of my motion. As I said, I am certain that I am speaking on behalf of all hon. Senators because the hon. Marais Viljoen, ex-senator, is a man who occupied the office of president of this Senate with great distinction. I think we will always remember his friendliness and fairness, and it is a pleasure for me to be able to mention his name in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Then I want to thank you, Mr. President, even though you have only been with us a few days in this capacity, for having taken over here at short notice as it were. We wish you great joy and success in the year or two or three still remaining; I am not too sure how long this Senate will still continue, but no matter how long it may be, we wish you everything of the best.</p>
                        <p>Then it is also a great pleasure for me to thank our old friend, the hon. Senator Hardie Muller, Deputy President and Chairman of committees, once again for the distinguished way he has officiated here this session. We trust that things will go well for him and his wife and that they will have a good rest during the recess and return to us once again next January.</p>
                        <p>I should also like to mention the name of our friend, the hon. Senator Herman Oelrich, Leader of the official Opposition. The hon. Senator Oelrich is so well known in this Senate, and in fact in politics in the Republic, that I most certainly need not go into too much detail in regaid to him. I also want to thank him for the manner in which he has conducted himself and we wish him a very pleasant recess.</p>
                        <p>I want to thank our temporary chairmen. They are the hon. Senator Van Rensburg; the hon. Senator W. P. Gouws; the hon. Senator G. P. van den Berg; the hon. Senator W. C. Dempsey and the hon. Senator C. C. Henderson&#x2014;all the young Senators who conducted themselves so well here. We wish to thank them very much.</p>
                        <p>When we speak of the smooth functioning of the business in this Senate we must address a special word of thanks to our Chief Whips, viz. the hon. Senator Gouws behind me, who is well-known to all of you. Just as well known is the hon. Senator Horak sitting opposite me. These are two redoubtable politicians and I hope that they will be with us again next year, refreshed and in good health.</p>
                        <p>I also say thank you to the other Whips of the other parties who were always in their places to keep things functioning smoothly. We thank them very much as well.</p>
                        <p>†The hon. Senator Winchester is not here today, but we should like to thank him as well. I hope the hon. Senator Winchester will not mind my calling him a maverick Senator in this House, but he has certainly contributed to making this a somewhat colourful place at times. We thank him for his contribution as we do the hon. Senator Du Toit. The hon. Senator Du Toit is the Leader of the Independent Party in this House. He is on his own as is the hon. Senator Winchester, but be has shown he can hold his own and we are glad to have him here. We hope he too will have a very pleasant respite.</p>
                        <p>I also want to thank all the other hon. Senators. After all, this House would not be what it is if it were not for the hon. Senators who are members here, and I think I can say that despite all our differences at times among the parties, we are, after all, a club, a rather pleasant club, and I think we are all very honoured to be here and probably would not wish to be anywhere else.</p>
                        <p>*And then, Mr. President, a special word of thanks to our secretariat, to Mr. Victor, Mr. Venter and the other members of the secretariat who have rendered such dedicated service and who have been of such great assistance to us.</p>

                            <person refersTo="hansard">LEADER OF THE HOUSE</person>:
                        </from>
                        <p>Then, Mr. President, we have the Press, the SABC and the television service of South Africa. I suppose most of us at one time or another during the session become a little impatient with one or other newspaper. We probably feel we have not had the publicity we should have had for our brilliant contributions. But all these things come out in the wash, they balance out in the end and the Press and the broadcasting services and television services are a quite inseparable part of our whole organization and we see them in that light.</p>
                        <p>In general, Mr. President, I would merely say that it is an honour for me to be able to move this motion as Leader of the House. The session has been an interesting one; it has been a lively one at times. For me it has not been the most pleasant session, if I may be perfectly frank, but, after all, there is such a thing as the rough and tumble of politics and one has to take the rough with the smooth. I think the great merit in our parliamentary tradition is that one does not bear any personal animosity and these things eventually all fall into place, they take their rightful place and are seen in proper perspective.</p>
                        <p>I hope all hon. Senators will have a particularly happy, restful and healthy recess. I hope all of us will come back next year feeling refreshed, and full of vigour to meet the further duties that will be confronting us.</p>
                        <p>Precisely how long this distinguished Upper House will continue, I am not sure. I think our present expectation is that we will continue till the end of 1980. That is the plan; whether it will work out precisely on that date, is a matter that the future will have to tell. However that may be, I for one&#x2014;and I think I speak for all my hon. friends in this House&#x2014;feel honoured to be a member of this Upper House of the Parliament of South Africa. As long as we are here and as long as the Senate does exist, I am sure we would all like to continue as one basically happy family, I think. I think we would like to continue to do our very best not only for our respective parties in a democratic system but for our country.</p>
                        <p>*In that spirit, Mr. President, I say again that it has been my privilege to express these few words of thanks and to move this motion of thanks and appreciation.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, I should like to associate myself with the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the House. On behalf of the official Opposition we should like to express our appreciation to all who contributed to the business of this House. This was perhaps one of the most difficult sessions many of us have experienced.</p>
                        <p>†Perhaps I might just interpose here, Sir, to say that I appreciate very much the spirit in which the Leader of the House has addressed us here when one considers everything that has taken place during this particular session. It is nice to know that he feels as we feel, namely, that whatever one does, whatever speech one may make, whatever attitude one may adopt, when we come to this particular hour of saying cheerio to each other, we do so in a very good spirit.</p>
                        <p>*As I said, Mr. President, this was probably one of the most difficult sessions I have ever experienced. On occasion harsher words were spoken than we are normally accustomed to in the peaceful atmosphere of this Upper House. But that does not prevent us expressing our recognition of those who deserve recognition. During this session we also had a change of President of the Senate. I think it would be fitting if we thanked our former President 
                            <i>in absentia</i> for his exemplary conduct at all times.

                        <p>To the new President we also want to say thank you for what he has done in the few days he has been with us. We hope he will recover completely from the throat infection he contracted, and that he will have a good rest and will be able to resume his post next year with competence.</p>
                        <p>To the Leader of the House, who, as he himself admitted underwent a particularly busy and difficult time, we also want to wish a pleasant rest, knowing that although we sometimes differed with him very strongly, we are nevertheless able to part in a good spirit.</p>
                        <p>I want to repeat what he had to say about the secretariat and all the members of the staff who fall under them. We are all well aware of how much time they have to spend to ensure that everything functions smoothly. If any minor matter goes wrong, it causes a major disruption, and they are at all times aware of their responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>We wish to convey our sincere thanks to the catering services and the security policy who have protected us here and to everyone we see here every day. We appreciate what they do for us.</p>
                        <p>I want to associate myself as well with what the hon. the Leader of the House said about our Whips. We know we could not manage without them, although very often one would like to be rid of them! They perform an extremely important task for us in this Upper House, and we say thank you very much to them for the responsible task they perform and for their friendly co-operation and guidance.</p>
                        <p>To all hon. Senators I also want to say: Goodbye. Have a good rest and be assured of our good wishes when we say we hope we see you all again in good health next year.</p>
                        <p>I have purposely left one person to the last Over a drink last night someone asked me if I knew how old Hardie Muller was? I said, no, I did not know. He is not a woman and he will not mind if I say how old he is. To be able to make the contribution he makes, at the age of 80, in the way he did, is something to marvel at. [Interjections.] I may be a few months out; but that is what I was told. I admire him for being able to do what he does at his age; he is there at every stage we need him, and he does it with so much competence. I want to tell my friend that we appreciate what he does for us. We appreciate his feelings for his friends. I have never seen him angry. Many of my colleagues get angry&#x2014;so do I. I know that the hon. the Minister can also get angry. But I have never seen the hon. Senator Muller angry.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps that is the answer. I want to say to Hardie, many, many thanks; I am pleased we can call one another friend. If I have left anybody out, Mr. President, I assure them that I did not do so deliberately. We do not want to spend too much time on this. Once again my best wishes and many thanks to everyone who has helped us.</p>

                        </from>
                        <p>Mr. President, allow me a few minutes to convey my sincere thanks to the persons mentioned by both the hon. the Leader of the House and the hon. Senator Oelrich.</p>
                        <p>I associate myself fully with their remarks about our present State President. He spent a long time in the Chair you now occupy, Sir. I do not think it is necessary to elaborate on that. His presence here definitely contributed to maintaining the dignity of this House.</p>
                        <p>To you, Mr. President my congratulations once again. I hope that as you are now in a more peaceful atmosphere in which you will really have more time to relax, you will return in full and good health.</p>
                        <p>†I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to the Leader of the House for the courtesy he has shown to me as a one-man party. I very much appreciate the way in which he has always treated me and the assistance that he has always given me. The position of a one-man party could be very difficult if the Leader of the House was not of the disposition that he is.</p>
                        <p>*I should also like to express my appreciation to the Whips on both sides of the House who have always been so kind to me and have always helped to keep me informed of what was happening. I also want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for his kindness.</p>
                        <p>We are all grateful to Mr. Victor and his staff for the way they always help us with any problems we might have. From the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you to them. I also want to thank the service officers who are always so good and take so much trouble to do for us what they think we would like to have done. To the South African Police who do such good work, and for their friendliness to us, I also want to say thank you. We can surely say that the police we have here contribute greatly to improving the goodwill there should be between the public and the police. I am sure that they make a fine contribution in this respect and I have the highest appreciation for what they do.</p>
                        <p>To the Press and other media I also want to say thank you for the part they play here.</p>
                        <p>I should also like to express my appreciation to the hon. Senator Muller for the fine way in which he presides, particularly during this session when for a long period he had to act as President of this Senate. I can assure him that my party and I have the highest appreciation for the service he has performed.</p>
                        <p>Although we do not always agree with one another, I want to assure hon. Senators that I enjoy their company, even the hon. Senator Van Schoor who feels I must say something special about him.</p>
                        <p>It has been a pleasure for me to sit here in my second year of independence. As we say in English: &#x201C;I am the envy of most of my hon. co-Senators.&#x201D; I have enjoyed my stay here and I trust that when we do leave this hon. Upper House, we will leave it with no regrets.</p>

                        <p>I should also like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Leader of the House, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, the hon. Senator Du Toit and to all the other hon. Senators for the very friendly way in which they have received me here. I should also like to associate myself with the good wishes to the Secretariat and to all the people here who make our lives comfortable, e.g. in regard to the serving of tea and all the other small things which make it possible for one to lead a pleasant life. We have the highest appreciation for all the work these officials do.</p>
                        <p>I want to express my special and sincere appreciation to the hon. Senator Muller who, after I had contracted a throat infection a few days ago, was so willing and kind and ready to take over my duties. I am not used to having other people do my job but this was a wonderful gesture of friendship.</p>
                        <p>I also want to thank the Secretary to Parliament for the assistance he has given me in connection with the formal duties of the Chair. My thanks too to the Chief Whip of the National Party and the Chief Whip of the Opposition who welcomed me in such a very friendly fashion here and made me feel as if I had been here for years.</p>
                        <p>†I should like to say that although hon. Senators differ in political affiliation in this hon. Senate, we all have one golden thread that binds us to one thing that we have in common, and that is a belief in the beauty and the goodness of South Africa and the belief that we can in some small way contribute something to the enhancement of community life in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>I should like to wish all the members of the Senate a very restful recess. I wish them a pleasant time and I hope that their health may be sustained. May they have spiritual rejuvenation and may they all come back next year entirely refreshed. Thank you very much.</p>

                            <answer by="#minister of foreign affairs" as="bozas">
                                <from>The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:</from>
                                <p>In general the reply is the same as that furnished to Question 2 of Friday, 23 February 1979, in the House of Assembly and which reads as follows:</p>
                                <p>If I have to reply to every question on the disbursement of special funds on individual projects, everything being done in terms of existing legislation risks exposure by a process of elimination. The practical effect of that would be that the objective of the legislation of this Parliament would be frustrated and its right of existence vitiated.</p>
                                <p>Since the Information issue has assumed such wide dimensions it is conceivable that doubt will have arisen on the part of the public over measures of control over disbursement of public funds for covert projects. The most important factor to allay concerns is effective accountability. A heavy onus would therefore rest on us to employ a method which would satisfy this requirement without harming the interests of the public which these projects are intended to promote.</p>
                                <p>You will recall that it was in response to a specific need that 
                                    <i>inter alia</i> a Special Account for the Department of Foreign Affairs was established by Act No. 38 of 1967, with the full endorsement of the then Opposition. When it has been determined that a given project promotes the interests of South Africa and that proper measures have been taken to ensure that the project is administered without any form of misappropriation of official funds or irregularity it is difficult to understand why divulgence is insisted upon. In terms of the legislation which I have referred to, a system of control accounting and internal auditing has been established in conjunction with the Auditor-general and the Treasury. A proper procedure has been prescribed to regulate the authorization of all expenditures with precision. The regulations and discipline applied in the handling of public funds in the Special Account go even further than required by the Act.
                                </p>
                                <p>It is important to acknowledge that, as in the case of all other funds, Parliament&#x2019;s financial watchdog, the Auditor-general, currently has complete access to the disbursement of funds in the Special Account and of the Information Service.</p>
                                <p>The Government&#x2019;s contention is that it is precisely because of the covert nature of the projects that we should exercise even greater care to ensure that irregularities do not occur. You will agree that, where there is no evidence of financial abuse or irregularities in the administration of a project the Government should be granted the freedom of action to decide on the method of execution which, according to its judgement, will best promote the interests of the country.</p>
                                <p>In the evaluation of each project a distinction should be drawn between the project and its execution. Should successful implementation be dependent upon nondisclosure it would be not only irresponsible to expose projects but disclosure could be harmful to the interests of South Africa. It would be especially in conflict with our interests if disclosure could harm relations between South Africa and a foreign country or well disposed organizations and individuals in a foreign country.</p>
                                <p>The projects which have already been evaluated and approved by the Pretorius Committee, are nevertheless still being subjected periodically to the test of effectiveness. The principle of co-ordinated action has also now been extended to include participation by the National Security Council which sets guidelines. Where it is found that a given project could be supported openly without compromising its effectiveness it will be disclosed, as was the case with the Institute for Plural Societies at the University of Pretoria. Two further examples are the Institute of Strategic Studies at the University of Pretoria and the Centre for International Politics at the University of Potchefstroom. In both instances it was decided to proceed openly with financial support of these institutions should they wish such support to be continued.</p>
                                <p>In this spirit I wish to appeal to our media for co-operation. Should there be the slightest evidence or irregularity I would not expect such information to be suppressed. On the contrary, we have a Commission of Inquiry to whom such evidence could be directed. The Auditor-General is an established channel available to investigate such matters.</p>
                                <p>I also wish to add the reply I furnished to Question 14 of Friday 30 March 1979 in the House of Assembly:</p>
                                <p>In order to withstand the psychological campaign against the Republic it is necessary to analyse the onslaught on a continuing basis and to devise counter action.</p>
                                <p>Evaluation of the projects by the Pretorius Committee and the Information Service of South Africa has disclosed that the present projects do not serve our national interest in the most effective manner. I have therefore decided to terminate with effect from 1 April 1979 all confidential and sensitive projects of the former Department of Information which have not after reconsideration already been implemented on a new basis. In their place newly formulated counter measures which will serve South Africa&#x2019;s interests more appropriately will be instituted. In this process the services and expertise of new associates and proven experts and organizations will be utilized.</p>
                                <p>It is the Government&#x2019;s view not to desert those who are working for the interests of South Africa by divulging existing confidential associations. This applies also to projects which will be discontinued. I am prepared to give the Information-spokesmen of Opposition parties insight into the state of those projects in force on 31 March 1979.</p>

This does not however imply that anyone can obtain adequate housing anywhere on application. The provision of housing for Whites is therefore being proceeded with on a selective basis in order to meet the demand arising out of the natural increase in population and to remove proved bottlenecks.</p>

The responsibility to obtain these affidavits vest in the Chairman of the John Dunn Descendants&#x2019; Association as well as attorneys who act on behalf of such beneficiaries. Finalization of the matter is hampered by the fact that a large number of the descendants cannot easily be traced and it is therefore impossible to indicate at this stage when all transfers will be effected.</li>
