This course focused on Cryptography

We learned the underlying techniques for  cryptographic functions such RSA DES AES. 

In Lab 1 we bit of work on solving different types of ciphers 
Lab 2 we worked with the DES algorithm	
Lab 3 we worked with RSA
Lab 4 we were creating  a simple simulation of blockchain and to establish attack vectors (Didn't get a good mark for this lab LOL)
Lab 5 we worked with hamming codes 

Note: All the source codes are for matlab
